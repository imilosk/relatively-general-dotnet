            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">No, I am not going to bore you with another repetition of the news. Yeah, Microsoft is going to bundle jQuery with Visual Studio and the ASP.Net MVC. That is important, but not quite as important as something else that I didn&#x27;t see other people pointing out. This is the first time in a long time that I have seen Microsoft incorporating an Open Source project into their product line.  I am both thrilled and shocked.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Don&#x27;t get used to the deluge of the screen casts, I usually do them with months apart, not a mere day. At any rate, this screen cast is another significant diversion from my usual style. To start with, it is a zero code webcast, and it would probably would well as a podcast, although I think that the artwork and presentation is still important. Anyway, this webcast is focused on several lessons learned from unsuccessful project, what are the kind of things that we should pay attention to, and how we can avoid them. It runs just under 40 minutes, and it is pretty intense. As I said, this is a new approach for me, and I would like to get your feedback on the matter.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, I spent almost two hours yesterday just getting things organized for the coming couple of months. It was only when I actually sat down to start making reservations that I figure out what I had set myself up to. 2nd Oct - 16th Oct - London, there is a ALT.Net beer night on the 14th that I am looking forward too. 27th Oct - 29th Oct - Dallas. 30th Oct - 2nd Nov - Austin for the ALT.Net conference there. 2nd Nov - 15th Nov - New Jersey. 16th Nov - 22th Nov - Sweden, for &#xD8;rdev. Oh, and there is DevTeach as well at the beginning of December, but I am not thinking that far ahead.</p>

I decided to follow Rob Conery&#x27;s method of using a lot of prepared code instead of my usual ad hoc programming. Please let me know what you think about the different style. This is a far more condensed episode, lasting just under half an hour, and it is focus primarily on the internal architecture of a real world application. I tried to go over a lot of the concepts that seems to trip people up when they come to define the structure of the application. &#xA0; The technical details:  ~30 minutes 28.4 MB You can download this from this address: http://ayende.com/hibernating-rhinos.aspx</p>

Documentation is a task that most developers strongly dislike. It is treated as a tedious, annoying task and often falls on the developer who protests the least. One additional problem is that a developer trying to document his own work is often not going to do a good work. This is not an aspiration against developers in general; the problem is that there are too many things that people who actually write the code takes for granted. And even in we ignore that, developers tend to write to developers, in a way that makes little sense to non developers. That is true for me as well.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The Managed Extensibility Framework is &quot;new library in .NET that enables greater reuse of applications and components. Using MEF, .NET applications can make the shift from being statically compiled to dynamically composed. If you are building extensible applications, extensible frameworks and application extensions, then MEF is for you.&quot; (I was too lazy to think about my own description for it, so I just copied the official one.) Probably the first thing that you should know about MEF is what will undoubtedly be the most common cause for confusion.  The Managed Extensibility Framework is not an IoC container.  This is not a slug at MEF, it is an important distinction. If you try to judge MEF through IoC container glasses, you will come away confused. It may walk like a duck, but it meows. MEF is, first and foremost, a composition framework. And its target audience are BIG applications. Those two, taken together, are important to understand what MEF is and how we should look at it. What is the difference between a composition framework and an IoC container? On the surface, they are doing much of the same thing, managing dependencies for the application in an automated fashion. The difference (and the devil) are in the details. IoC containers have long ago stopped just managing dependencies. They are taking care of a lot of additional responsibilities. Managing lifecycles, proxies, aspect orientation, event aggregation, transaction semantics and a lot of other features. In addition to that, there is a lot of focus on problem solving by utilizing the container. Things like generic specialization or component selectors allows you to approach a lot of very complex problems in a completely different mindset. A composition framework, on the other hand, is focused on a single goal: dependency management.  It sounds like MEF is a subset of what an IoC container is doing, I know. This is not the case. MEF, the bits we have right now, are doing a lot more in the area of dependency management than the containers are doing. Where a container is usually static and opaque, MEF primary focus is to make the dependency management itself a dynamic and transparent process. This is where the second part of the MEF design goals come into place. MEF is targeting Big applications. The really big ones. One of the immediate customers of MEF is Visual Studio itself.  Things like ( take a deep breath ):  being able to query meta data without loading assemblies statically verify the dependency graph for all the components and reject those that would put the system in in valid state being explicit by default contract adapters discovery  metadata tagging  All of those are key concepts in the overall dependency management theme. And all of those are the product of having a Visual Studio being one of the first consumers of this project. Visual Studio needs this kind of things, across tens of thousands of components. And MEF is setup to handle those kind of scenarios. So, MEF is very similar to IoC containers, but it has very different goals (or maybe it would be more accurate to say that it has very different priorities).  Another important aspect of MEF has nothing to do with it at all and everything to do with where it is going to be used. MEF is going to ship with .Net 4.0, which put it in a position to be very widely distributed, but more importantly, since it is on the framework, it can be used by other parts of the framework. Which is where it get interesting.  There are a lot of places in the framework that could make use of a container. IControllerFactory is a good example of something that should not exists, for example. I am ambivalent with regards to that, because I think that the correct abstraction for those kind of things is not necessarily MEF, but that is beside the point. And that is enough for now, I am going to toss a coin and see if it is going to be Erlang code or meta documentation next.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay! After diving into CouchDB source code and doing an in depth review of the btree:lookup, I am ready for the real challenge, figuring out how CouchDB writes to the btree. This is the really interesting part, from my point of view.  The heart of this functionality is the query_modify method. This method allow us to perform a batch of operations on the tree in one go. Following my own ideal that all remote APIs (and this is talking to disk, hence, remote) should support batching, I really like the idea.   The first part is dedicated to building the actions list. I am not going to go over that in detail, but I will say that this first sort things by key, and then by action. So, for example, let us say that I want to perform the following actions:  query_modify(tree, {&#x27;c&#x27;, &#x27;a&#x27;},&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;a&#x27;) What will happen is that we will first query the current value of &#x27;a&#x27;, then we will remove it, and then we will insert it. Finally, we will query the value of &#x27;c&#x27;. This is done in order to ensure good traversal performance of the tree, as well as to ensure consistency when performing multiple operations. The part that really interest us is modify_node, which perform the actual work:   Now we are starting to see how things are really happening. We can see that if the root is null we create a value node, or we find the appropriate node if it is not. This follows what we seen in the lookup. Moving on, we forward the call to modify_kpnode or modify_kvnode. I am going to touch kpnode first, since it is bound to be simpler (kvnode needs to handle splitting, I would assume).   This is far from trivial code, and I don&#x27;t think that I understand it fully yet, but what it basically does is fairly simple. First the first node that match the current FirstActionKey, if this is the last node that we have to deal with, we call modify_node on it, accumulate the result and return it. If it is not the last node, we split the work, sending all that are less than or equal to the current FirstActionKey to be handled using modify_node (which is likely to be a key/value node and thus handled directly) and continue to handle the rest using modify_kpnode. In a way, this is the exact reverse of how lookup_kvnode is handled. modify_kvnode is complex. I can&#x27;t fit the functions on a single screen in a 1280x1024 resolution. I am going to split it into two sections. It is not ideal, since they are supposed to go together, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll manage.   The first part is to handle the case where we have more actions to perform. In this case, we can simple return the results. The second is there to handle the case where we run out of the items in the node. Note how insert works, for example. You can see that the way that the btree works is the same in which Erlang does. That is, we will always rewrite the entire node, rather than modify it.&#xA0; remove is also interesting. If we got to this point and haven&#x27;t found the node, it doesn&#x27;t exist, so we can move on. Same for fetching. Now let us see the more complex part, what happen if we do find the items in the value node?   Note that we have AccNode, which is our accumulator. We find the first node that match ActionKey, and then we take the NodeTuple and the AccNode and turn them into a reverse list. This copies all the items that are less than the current one to the ResultNode, those are the ones that we are not interested in, so we can just copy them as is. The next part handles the actual adding/removing/fetching from the node. It is pretty self explanatory, I think, so I&#x27;ll leave it at that. So now we understand what modify_kvnode and modify_kpnode works. But there is nothing here about splitting nodes, which I find suspicious. Let us go back to modify_node and look what else is going on there:   Ah, note the handling of NewNodeList, there is probably where the money is. We make a couple of tests. The first is to see if there are any nodes left, the second to see if we changed the node list (by comparing it to the old value). We don&#x27;t care for any of those at the moment, so we will focus on the last one. write_node is called, and this is likely where we will see what we are looking for.   Well, this is simple enough, and chunkify seems like what we were looking for. However, It bothers me that we write all the nodes to disk. Is seems... wrong somehow. More specifically, since we are always appending, aren&#x27;t we going to break the binary tree? There is also the reduce_node call that is hiding there, which we also need to check. It is being called after the node was written to disk, so I am not sure what is going on here. Let us read chunkify first, and then deal with reduce_node.   Well... it looks like the chunkify function sucks. But anyway, what is going on there is fairly simple. We check if the list that we were passed is greater than CHUNK_THRESHOLD. This is set to 1279, for some strange reason that I can&#x27;t follow. I assume that the reason for that is to ensure blocks of less than 1280, but that no sector size that I have heard of came in this size. The second part is more interesting (and complex). OutputChunks is a list of lists of the elements that started in the InList. This piece of code is very short, but it does a tremendous amount of work.  And now we can move back to reduce_node, like I promised.   This is short, to the point, and interesting. The idea of rereduce is that when something has changed, you don&#x27;t have to go and recalculate everything from scratch, you can take partial reduced results and the new values and combine them to produce the same result that you would have if you had reduced over the entire data set. As you can see, calling reduce_node on a key pointer node will cause a re reduction, while on a value node, it just reduce after a map. I am assuming that the thought was that value nodes are small enough that there is no point in optimizing this. There are a few interesting points that need to be raised, which I don&#x27;t have answers for at the moment.   Why is this happening after we write to file? How does this relate to CouchDB&#x27;s ability to shell out to java script in order to perform maps and reductions? What ensure that the ordering of the node reduction match the tree hierarchy? At any rate, this completes our examination of write_node and modify_node, we can now go back to where we started, query_modify:   We are nearly at the end. We have seen that the nodes are written to disk after being chunkified. Note that currently nothing actually have a reference to them at this point. We do have KeyPointers, but they aren&#x27;t attached to anything. If we crashed right now (directly after modify_node), there is no state change as far as we are concerned, we just lost some disk space that we will recover in the next compaction. I am pretty sure that complete_root is the one responsible for hooking everything together, so let us see what it does...   Yes, I expected complete_root to be complicated as well :-) What is going on here is the actual missing piece. This is what takes all the value nodes and turn them into pointer nodes, and does so recursively until we finally get to the point where we only have a single value returned, which is the root node. There is also handling for no nodes, in which case the tree is empty. Basically, what this means that that the way CouchDB is able to achieve ACID using a btree is by saving the modified tree structure to disk on each commit. Since it is only the modified part that is saved, and since btree structure are really small, it has no real storage penalty. Now I want to go and find what actually save the new root tree to disk, since query_modify does not modify the actual header (which means that in the case of a crash, nothing will change from the point of view of the system). Right now I suspect that this is intentional, that this allows to combine even more actions into a single transaction, even beyond what you can do in a single query_modify. This is especially true since the common interface for those would usually be add, remove, etc. As an interesting side effect, this is also how CouchDB is able to handle MVCC. Since everything is immutable, it can just hand a tree reference to the calling code and forget about it. No changes ever occur, so you get serializable isolation level by default. And, from what I can see, basically for free. Going over the couch_httpd file, is seems that the main interface is couch_db, so I am heading that way... and I run into some very complex functions that I don&#x27;t really feel like reading right now. Hope this post doesn&#x27;t contain too many mistakes...</p>
