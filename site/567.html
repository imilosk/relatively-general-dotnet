            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a fictitious&#xA0; example of such a bug, but this would probably sound familiar.&#xA;Jane was soundly sleeping around 3AM when the phone started ringing off the hook. Dazed and not quite in full possession of her faculties, she picked up the phone and heard Tom from Operations screaming that the Northwind System was gone. It wasn&#x2019;t just one application that died, it was all of them, and Operations had no idea what is going on, any CxO in the company was pissed and they were bleeding money and reputation by the second.&#xA;While driving to work, Jane took part in a conference call trying to figure out what happened. The following things became clear:&#xA;&#xA;    There had been no changes to the production environment in the last week.&#xA;    The last change was in the reporting system, which was humming along for the last two weeks or so.&#xA;    Database servers were pegged by ridiculous amounts of queries from all applications.&#xA;    Cache servers were up and functioning.&#xA;    The production logs verbosity was adjusted and it seemed that every single query was a cache miss.&#xA;&#xA;It became clear that something cause every single application to skip the cache and go directly to the database, but no one knew what.&#xA;Upon arriving at the office, they run into more puzzlement, frustration and anger. The problem was definitely related to the cache, but there was absolutely no explanation for that. The cache code was written several years ago, it was a pretty complex piece of code, and it was tested in production for almost as long.&#xA;The first suspicion fell on some sort of communication breakage between the application servers and the cache servers, but that was quickly ruled out. Looking at the logs, it was clear that the problem was 100% cache misses causing every single query to hit the database, which responded by throwing up its hands and sulking, refusing to talk to anyone.&#xA;The problem was absolutely non reproducible in the test or development environment. &#xA;The team decided to appropriate a single production server and run their tests on it. In production, it was absolutely reproducible, but no one could figure out why. Network traces from that server showed that it never even tried to connect to the cache servers for reading the queries, however, it would happily connect to the cache servers for writing the queries.&#xA;The root problem was found, then, somehow, there was a problem in reading data from the cache servers. Three developers and at least one IT guy were willing to swear on the religion of your choice that this is absolutely not possible, but evidence suggested otherwise.&#xA;Installing a kernel level network trace was suggested. After installing the trace and rebooting the machine, the team hovered over the admin head while they started up the application again and watched the network trace from the kernel. This time, however, they could see it reading from the cache servers. &#xA;Not only that, but it looked like the application was functioning normally! Installing the kernel trace fixed the problem! Since this was an issue of production being down, they tried the same method on a second server, and that came back up normally as well. Every single IT guy in the building was suddenly busy installing a kernel network trace, and lo and behold, the entire system came back up.&#xA;By that time, it was close to 4 PM of the following day, and just about everyone was exhausted. The CTO sent everyone whom and scheduled a meeting at 9 AM to discuss what happened.&#xA;At 9 AM the following day, no one could really suggest a working hypothesis for what actually happened. The Administration Module Team Lead suggested that their system has run into some threading bug in the network stack and installing the kernel level trace had changed the timing just enough to make the problem go away. The Reporting Module Team Lead snapped that it is not possible to have a network bug that only affect reading from a particular socket. The IT group insisted that there were no modifications to the production environment, all changed firewall rules in the last month were reviewed, and they couldn&#x2019;t do that.&#xA;The CTO closed the meeting by quoting the damage that this downtime has done to the company, and directed everyone to investigate it further. No actual smoking gun could be found, and eventually the matter was dropped. One of the results of this change was an added emphasis on the production worthiness of all the parts of the system. Traces and logs were enhanced, circuit breakers were introduced and in general the team thought that they are pretty safe. The kernel trace fixed the problem, of course, but next time they will have a lot more information about what is going on.&#xA;&#xA;Four months later&#x2026;&#xA;&#xA;The production issue that brought down the site was almost forgotten by this time, the system was running along happily for months, the changes to make the system more robust in production were already there, and everyone was happy.&#xA;Until the 3AM call on Thursday&#x2019;s night. While driving back to work on empty roads, Jane had a strong sense of deja-vu. Again, the problem was that the system was hammering the database, again the log showed 100% cache misses. Again, there was no significant change to the production environment.&#xA;This time, the team already knew who the culprit was, and the caching system was given a thorough overview. No one could really find something wrong with it, but even more logging was added, and the change was pushed to production, where it didn&#x2019;t seem to do any good at all.&#xA;Trying to ignore the CxO screaming match in the nearby conference room, the Infrastructure team tried to figure out what was wrong exactly. Jane thought that the problem was with the cache invalidation logic. The caching system used a fairly complex system to decide whatever a value in the cache was fresh enough or not. &#xA;Disabling that piece of the system was risking stale data scenarios, but stale data was better than no data. They commented that part out and push that to production. Unfortunately, it didn&#x2019;t change one iota, and the system kept producing cache misses.&#xA;That was patently impossible, of course, but there was it. The IT group, in the meantime, came to the rescue. Trevor, the new guy on the team, decided to try deploying the application to a brand new server that was waiting to be provisioned. On the new server, the system worked, and that server did not have the kernel network trace installed.&#xA;Acting on instinct, they tried uninstalling the kernel network trace on one of the existing production servers. Like magic, that server came back to life and started working normally seconds after the reboot was completed. A rolling uninstallion of the magical kernel trace fixed the issue. &#xA;But this was being the second failure this year, and both could be traced to the same component. The development team was at a loss to explain what was going on there. For the next month or so, no developer dared walk by the executives part of the building. External consultants were brought in to do an in depth study of the code base, trying to find the problem. The consultants couldn&#x2019;t really find anything to blame, but they didn&#x2019;t trust the existing home grown cache servers. The company bought a commercial cache package, to the tune of 2,000 $ per CPU, replacing their caching backend.&#xA;For a while, it seemed like that would do it&#x2026;&#xA;Jane woke up a few seconds before 3 AM, two months after the previous incident. It was Thursday again, and the phone was ringing. After briefly considering running away to the Sahara, she picked up the phone. It was the exact same scenario.&#xA;After arriving at the office, Jane didn&#x2019;t bother to join the already violent row in the conference room, she sat down on her desk and brought up the Caching Module. She sat down and added a logging statement after each line in the codebase. Then she called Operations and had them push the new caching module to production.&#xA;That change didn&#x2019;t fix the problem, but it gave Jane an exception. And that exception just wasn&#x2019;t possible.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.   at System.Array.InternalGetReference(Void* elemRef, Int32 rank, Int32* pIndices)   at System.Array.GetValue(Int32 index)   at Northwind.CachingModule.CacheSelector.GetServer()   at Northwind.CachingModule.Cache.Get(string key)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;That didn&#x2019;t make any sort of sense, but at least she had a single method to check for.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;private CacheServer GetServer(){    if(aliveAndWellServes.Count == 0)        return null;    var server = aliveAndWellServes[Environment.TickCount % aliveAndWellServes.Length];    if(server.IsAlive == false)    {        aliveAndWellServes.Remove(server);        server.Dispose();    }    return server;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The idea was to spread the load between the cache servers, so there wouldn&#x2019;t be a single cache server being hit repeatedly. Somehow, that method was failing, when it failed, it caused the caching system generic error handler to consider this as a downed cache server, and produce a cache miss.&#xA;Jane pushed another update to production, this time adding pervasive logging to the GetServer method. The output said it all.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Alive and well servers: 4Tick count: -137538094Server index: -2&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Looking at the documentation of the Environment.TickCount, it all became clear. That method will return a negative number if the system has been running for over 25 days. When that happened, the cache implementation would fail, leading to overload on the database and closing the entire system down.&#xA;The reason that the error was patches meant that the servers were occasionally rebooted, so you had to wait until enough time passed since the last reboot. Installing and uninstalling the kernel trace resulted in a reboot, which temporarily fix the problem.&#xA;An interesting final tidbit about this error. No one mentioned to the executives that all source control systems come with a blame feature.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you head out to http://hibernatingrhinos.com/, you will see that I finally had the time to setup the corporate site. This is still very early, but I have a lot of content to add there, but it is a start.  Impleo, the CMS running the site, doesn&#x2019;t have any web based interface, instead, it is built explicitly to take advantage of Windows Live Writer and similar tools. The &#x201C;interface&#x201D; for editing the site is the MetaWeblog API. This means that in order to edit the site, there isn&#x2019;t any Wiki syntax to learn, or XML files to edit, or anything of this sort.  You have a powerful editor in your fingertips, one that properly handle things like adding images and other content. This turn the whole experience around. I usually find documentation boring, but I am used to writing in WLW, it is fairly natural to do, and it removes all the pain from the equation.   One of the things that I am trying to do with it is to setup a proper documentation repository for all my open source projects. This isn&#x2019;t something new, and it is something that most projects have a hard time doing. I strongly believe in making things simple, in reducing friction. What I hope to do is to be able to accept documentation contributions from the community for the OSS projects.  I think that having a full fledged rich text editor in your hands is a game changer, compared to the usual way OSS handle documentation.&#xA0; Take a look at what is needed to make this works, it should take three minutes to get started, no learning curve, no &#x201C;how do they do this&#x201D;.   So here is the deal, if you would like to contribute documentation (which can be anything that would help users with the projects), I just made things much easier for you. Please contact me directly and I&#x2019;ll send you the credentials to be able to edit the site.  Thanks in advance for your support.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rob Conery and I had sat down and started recording a series of webcasts on NHibernate, which will show up on TekPub. TekPub is a paid service, and there are two NHibernate screen casts there already. We plan to have lots more.  I got a lot of requests for making my NHibernate courses available to a wider audience. And this is a way for you to get a ton of NHibernate content. So far the reactions that we got were very positive.  Oh, and as a side effect, you get to see NH Prof used by the person who wrote it, you might learn a thing or two about extracting information from the profiler.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that I avidly subscribe to is that when you are building server applications, visibility into what the application is doing is key. If you don&#x2019;t have visibility into the application, you are left in the dark, stumbling and alone.&#xA;NH Prof is a good example of how you make things much more visible to developers, but I am doing this in many other places, Rhino Service Bus is another example of how important it is to have visibility into what your servers are doing. Being able to see what is actually going on in your apps is priceless! &#xA;However, that does come at a cost. And a pretty steep one at that.&#xA;Logging is expensive. It is expensive to gather the data to log, it is expensive to actually log the data, in order to produce coherent logs in multi threaded environment, you need to perform synchronization, etc.&#xA;One of the most common performance problems that people run into is when they push their debug logging configuration to production. If we will look into NHibernate as a good example, if you set the log level to debug, you are going to get tens of thousands of messages just for the startup! And you are going to get hundreds and thousands of log messages for routine operations.&#xA;That is going to slow things down, considerably.&#xA;Production configuration management is a big topic, and it deserves its own post, but the impact of setting the log level too low in production cannot be stressed strongly enough.&#xA;Pay attention to this, or it will make you pay attention to it. &#xA;In one notable case, several years ago, we re-implemented a whole module in the application (significantly optimizing it) to get exactly zero benefit (well, negative benefit, actually) from the exercise, since the actual problem was slow logging database.&#xA;In another, we improved performance by over 60% by simply raising the log level from DEBUG to ERROR.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into an annoyingly persistent error on a production server:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;System.Messaging.MessageQueueException: Insufficient resources to perform operation.   at System.Messaging.MessageQueue.SendInternal(Object obj, MessageQueueTransaction internalTransaction, MessageQueueTransactionType transactionType)   at System.Messaging.MessageQueue.Send(Object obj)   at ConsoleApplication1.Program.Main(String[] args)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This was generated from the following code:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;class Program{    static void Main(string[] args)    {        try        {            var queue = new MessageQueue(@&quot;.\private$\MyQueue&quot;);            queue.Send(&quot;test msg&quot;);            Console.WriteLine(&quot;success&quot;);         }        catch (Exception e)        {            Console.WriteLine(e);        }    }}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The error was happening on all queues, and persisted even after rebooting the machine. I should mention that we had a runaway message generation, and we have queues with lots of messages currently.&#xA0; The queue that I was trying to send the message to was empty, however. And there was no reading/writing on the queues.&#xA;Nasty issue to figure out, I was pointed to this post, and indeed, suggestion #7 was it, we run over the machine quota for MSMQ, so it started rejecting messages.&#xA;No one really thought about it, because we never set the quota, but it seems that by default there is a 1GB quota for the entire machine. This is usually more than enough to handle things, I would assume, but when you run into a convoy situation, bad things will happen.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Karl has posted about his experience of porting an NHibernate application from SQL Server to PostgreSQL, long story short, he did it in 1 hour.  He does bring up a few points where the database that he was using bled into the code, hurting the database independence goal. I wanted to look at those and point out the builtin solutions that NHibernate provides for those.  Handling unique constraints violations, Karl has code like this:     try&#xA;{&#xA;    Session.SaveOrUpdate(user);&#xA;    transaction.Commit();&#xA;    return true;&#xA;}&#xA;catch (GenericADOException ex)&#xA;{&#xA;    transaction.Rollback();&#xA;    var sql = ex.InnerException as SqlException;&#xA;    if (sql != null &amp;&amp; sql.Number == 2601)&#xA;    {&#xA;        return false;&#xA;    }&#xA;    throw;&#xA;}&#xA;catch (Exception)&#xA;{&#xA;    transaction.Rollback();&#xA;    throw;&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Obviously, this code relies heavily on internal knowledge of SQL Server error codes, and wouldn&#x2019;t translate to PostgreSQL.&#xA;&#xA;With NHibernate, you deal with those issues by writing ISqlExceptionConverter, you can read Fabio&#x2019;s post about this, but the gist of it is that you can provide your own exceptions in a database independent way.&#xA;&#xA;The count function may return different types on different databases. NHibernate tries to stay true to whatever the database is giving it, so it wouldn&#x2019;t truncate information. You can force the issue by overriding the count function definition by writing a derived dialect. You can see an example of that in this post.&#xA;&#xA;Bits &amp; Booleans, while SQL Server accepts 1 as a Boolean value, PostgreSQL requires that you would use &#x2018;1&#x2019; instead. This is where NHibernate&#x2019;s query.substitutions supports come in. I usually define substitutions for true and false and then use true and false in the queries. Based on the database that I am running on, I can select what will be substituted for those values.&#xA;&#xA;Achieving database independence with NHibernate is very easy, as Karl&#x2019;s 1 hour porting story proves.</p>
