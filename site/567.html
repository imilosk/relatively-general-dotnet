            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The major goal that I had in mind for the profiler was online development usage. That is, do something, check the profiler, clear it, do something else, etc. One of the things that I am finding out is that people use it a lot more as a dumping ground. They push a lot of information into it, and then want to sift through that and look at how the application behave, not just a single scenario.  Surprisingly, it works quite well, especially with the recently implemented performance profiling sessions that we just run through. One scenario, however, remains stubbornly outside what the profiler can currently do. When people talk to me about it, they call it load tests profiling, or integration tests profiling. This is when you pour literally gigabytes of information into the profiler. And it works, provided you have enough memory, that is.  If you don&#x2019;t have enough memory, however, you get to say hello to OutOfMemoryException.  When I dove into this problem I was sure that I would simply find that there is something stupid that I am doing wrong, and that as soon as I&#x2019;ll figure it out, it will be all right. I actually did find a few places where I could optimize memory usage (reducing lambda usage in favor of cached delegates to named methods, for example), but that only shaved a few percentage points. Trying out string interning actually resulted in a huge saving in memory, but I feel that this is just a stop gag measure. I have to persist the data to disk, rather than keep it in memory.  That lead me to a very interesting problem. What I need is basically a key value store. Interestingly enough, I already wrote one. The problem is that while this would work great right now, I have future plans which means depending on Esent is an&#x2026; unwise choice. Basically, I would like to be able to run on Mono and/or Silverlight and that rules out using a Windows only / full trust native dll. As they say, a bummer. That requirement also rules out using the various embedded databases as well.  I considered ignoring this requirement and handling it when the times come, but I decided that since this is going to majorly effect how I am going to use it, I can&#x2019;t really afford to delay that decision. With that in mind, I set out to figure out what I needed:     A fast way to store / retrieve a session information along with its associated data (stack trace, alerts, statistics, etc).    Ability to store, at a minimum, tens of thousands of items of variable size.    A single file (or at least, very few files) &#x2013; cannot afford to have one item per file (it usually kills the FS).    Support updates without re-writing the entire file.    Usable from Mono &amp; Silverlight, or easily portable to them.   With that in mind, I decided to take a look at what is already out there.     C#-Sqlite looked like it might be the ticker. It is a C# port of the Sqlite database. Unfortunately, I took a look at the code base and it is a port to C#, the code gave me the willies. I don&#x2019;t feel that I can trust it, and at any rate, it would require me to write a lot of data access code, that is a thing that I am trying to avoid :-). (And no, you can&#x2019;t use NHibernate with that version, you would have to port the ADO.Net driver as well, and then you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use it in Silverlight anyway.)    Caching Application Block &#x2013; because it looked like it had a persistent solution already. That persistent solution is based on several files per item, which is not acceptable. I already tried that route in the past, it is a good way to kill your file system.    SilverDB &#x2013; this is an interesting code base, and a good solution for the problem it is meant to (saving relatively small amount of information to disk). However, I need to save large amounts of information, and I need to handle a lot of updates. SilverDB re-write the entire file whenever it is saving. That has too high a perf cost for my needs.    TheCache &#x2013; I took only a brief look here, but it looks that it is too heavily focused on being a cache to be useful for my purposes.   In fact, given my requirements, it might be interesting to see what I don&#x2019;t need.     Not reliable.    Not thread safe.    Saving is just a way to free memory.   Given that, I decided to go with the following method:     Custom serialization format, allowing me to save space &amp; time using file &amp; memory based string interning.    No persistent file index, that can be kept directly in memory.    Persisted string interning file.   As you can see, this is a very tailored solution, not something that would be generally useful, but I have great hopes for this.</p>

The issue is simple, I want to intern strings (so a string value is only held once through my entire app), but I don&#x2019;t want to be stuck with them if the profiler state has been clear, for example.      public class GarbageCollectibleStringInterning&#xA;{&#xA;    private static IDictionary&lt;string,string&gt; strings = new Dictionary&lt;string,string&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;    private static ReaderWriterLockSlim locker = new ReaderWriterLockSlim();&#xA;    &#xA;    public static void Clear()&#xA;    {&#xA;        locker.EnterWriteLock();&#xA;        try&#xA;        {&#xA;            strings.Clear();&#xA;        }&#xA;        finally&#xA;        {&#xA;            locker.ExitWriteLock();&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    public static string Intern(string str)&#xA;    {&#xA;        string val;&#xA;        &#xA;        locker.EnterReadLock();&#xA;        try&#xA;        {&#xA;            if(strings.TryGetValue(str, out val))&#xA;                return val;&#xA;        }&#xA;        finally&#xA;        {&#xA;            locker.ExitReadLock();&#xA;        }&#xA;        &#xA;        locker.EnterWriteLock();&#xA;        try&#xA;        {&#xA;            if(strings.TryGetValue(str, out val))&#xA;                return val;&#xA;                &#xA;            strings.Add(str,str);&#xA;            return str;&#xA;        }&#xA;        finally&#xA;        {&#xA;            locker.ExitWriteLock();&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;This is a fairly simple implementation, a more complex one may try to dynamically respond to GC notification, but I think that this would be useful enough on its own.&#xA;&#xA;Using this approach, I was able to reduce used memory in the profiler by over 50%. I gave up on that approach, however, because while it may reduce the memory footprint, it doesn&#x27;t actually solve the problem, only delay it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, I have a problem with the profiler. At the root of things, the profiler is managing a bunch of strings (SQL statements, stack traces, alerts, etc). When you start pouring large amount of information into the profiler, the number of strings that it is going to keep in memory is going to increase, until you get to say hello to OutOfMemoryException.  During my attempt to resolve this issue, I figured out that string interning was likely to be the most efficient way to resolve my problem. After all, most of the strings that I have to display are repetitive. String interning has one problem, it exists forever. I spent a few minutes creating a garbage collectible method of doing string interning. In my first test, which was focused on just interning stack traces, I was able to reduce memory consumption by 50% (about 800Mb, post GC) and it is fully garbage collectible, so it won&#x2019;t hung around forever.  Sounds good, right?  Well, not really. While it is an interesting thought experiment, using interning is a great way of handling things, but it only mask the problem, and that only for a short amount of time. The problem is still an open ended set of data that I need to deal with, and while there are a whole bunch of stuff that I can do to delay the inevitable, defeat is pretty much ensured. The proper way of doing that is not trying to use hacks to reduce memory usage, but to deal with the root cause, keeping everything in memory.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My last post caused quite a bit of furor, and I decided that I wanted to respond to all the comments in a single place.     EF has a designer, NHibernate does not.      This is actually false, NHibernate has multiple designers available for it. Active Writer (Free, OSS, integrated into VS), Visual NHibernate (Commercial, Beta) and LLBLGen (Commercial, forthcoming in early 2010). I would say that using a designer with NHibernate isn&#x2019;t something that is very common, most people tend to either code gen the entire model and tweak that (minority) or hand craft the model &amp; mapping. That isn&#x2019;t for lack of options, it is because it is simply more efficient to do so in most cases.    EF is from Microsoft.       Yes, it is. That is a good point, because it reflect on support &amp; documentation. Unfortunately, the fact that this was one of the most prominent reasons quoted in the replies is also interesting. It says a lot about the relative quality of the products themselves. Another issue with a data access framework from Microsoft is that history teaches us that few data access methods from Microsoft survive the 2 years mark, and none survive the 5 years mark. RDO, ADO, ADO.Net, Object Spaces, Linq To Sql, Entity Framework &#x2013; just to name a few.    Downstream integration.      That was mentioned a few times, as in integration with data services, WCF RIA, etc. I want to divide my comment to that into two parts. First, everything that exists right now can be use with NHibernate. Second, EF is supposed to come with reporting / BI tools in the future. Currently, everything that came up was easily usable with NHibernate, so I am not really worried about it.    In the Future it will be awesome.       Some people pointed out that Microsoft is able to allocate more resources for EF than an OSS project can. That is true to a point. One of the problems that Microsoft is facing is that it has to pay a huge amount of taxes in the way to create a releasable product. That means that it is typically easier for an OSS project to release faster than a comparable Microsoft project.    So far, I find it really interesting that no one came up with any concrete feature that EF can do that NHibernate can&#x2019;t. I am going to let you in on a secret, when EF was announced, there were exactly two things that it could do that NHibernate could not. Both were fixed before EF 1.0 shipped, just because that fact annoyed me.  Are you telling me that no such thing exists for the new version?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a diff from the performance improvement effort of UberProf. The simple addition of .ToList() has significantly improved the performance of this function:     Why?  Before adding the ToList(), each time we try to run our aggregation functions on the statements enumerable, we would force re-evaluation of the filtering (which can be quite expensive). By adding ToList() I am now making the filtering run only once.   There is another pretty obvious performance optimization that can be done here, can you see it? And why did I choose not to implement it?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">While working on improving the performance of the profiler, I got really annoyed. The UI times for updating sessions with large amount of statements was simply unacceptable. We already virtualized the list UI, so it couldn&#x2019;t be that. I started tracking it down, and it finally came down to the following piece of code:     protected override void Update(IEnumerable&lt;IStatementSnapshot&gt; snapshots)&#xA;{&#xA;    foreach (var statementSnapshot in snapshots)&#xA;    {&#xA;        var found = (from model in unfilteredStatements&#xA;                     where model.Id == statementSnapshot.StatementId&#xA;                     select model).FirstOrDefault();&#xA;&#xA;        if (found == null)&#xA;        {&#xA;            unfilteredStatements.Add(&#xA;                new StatementModel(applicationModel, statementSnapshot) {CanJumpToSession = false});&#xA;        }&#xA;        else&#xA;        {&#xA;            found.UpdateWith(statementSnapshot);&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    if (snapshots.Any())&#xA;    {&#xA;        hasPolledForStatements = true;&#xA;        StatementsChanged(this, &#xA;            new StatementsChangedEventArgs {HasPolledForStatments = hasPolledForStatements});&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;This looks pretty innocent, right? At a guess, what is the performance characteristics of this code?&#xA;&#xA;It isn&#x2019;t O(N), that is for sure, look at the linq query, it will perform a linear search in the unfilteredStatements, which is an O(N) operation. *&#xA;&#xA;At first glance, it looks like O(N*N), right? Wrong!&#xA;&#xA;unfilteredStatements is an ObservableCollection, and guess what is going on in the CollectionChanged event? A statistics function that does yet another O(N) operation for every single added statement.&#xA;&#xA;Finally, we have the StatementsChanged handler, which will also perform an O(N) operation, but only once.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  protected override void Update(IEnumerable&lt;IStatementSnapshot&gt; snapshots)&#xA;{&#xA;    var hasStatements = false;&#xA;    foreach (var statementSnapshot in snapshots)&#xA;    {&#xA;        IStatementModel found;&#xA;        statementsById.TryGetValue(statementSnapshot.StatementId, out found);&#xA;        hasStatements = true;&#xA;&#xA;        if (found == null)&#xA;        {&#xA;            unfilteredStatements.Add(new StatementModel(applicationModel, statementSnapshot) {CanJumpToSession = false});&#xA;            statementsById.Add(statementSnapshot.StatementId, found);&#xA;        }&#xA;        else&#xA;        {&#xA;            found.UpdateWith(statementSnapshot);&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    if (hasStatements == false) &#xA;        return;&#xA;    HandleStatementsOrFiltersChanging(true);&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;The changes here are subtle, first, we killed off the O(N) linq query in favor of an O(1) lookup in a hashtable. Second, unfilteredStatements is now a simple List&lt;T&gt;, and HandleStatementsOrFilterChanging is the one responsible for notifications. Just these two changes were sufficent from the O(N^3&#x2B;N) that we had before to a simple O(N&#x2B;N) (because we still run some statistical stuff at the end) which collapses so a simple O(N).&#xA;&#xA;Once that is done, showing sessions with 50,000 statements in them became instantaneous.&#xA;&#xA;* Yes, it is supposed to be O(M) because the unfilteredStatements.Count is different than snapshots.Count, but I am simplifying here to make things easier.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned before that I run into some performance problems, I thought it would be interesting to see how I solved them.   The underlying theme was finding O(N) operations are eradicating them. In almost all the cases, the code is more complex, but significantly faster              Old code        New code                           public static class TimestampExtensions&#xA;{&#xA;    public static void AddInPlace&lt;T&gt;(this IList&lt;T&gt; self, T model)&#xA;        where T : IHaveTimestamp&#xA;    {&#xA;        int index = self.Count;&#xA;        for (var i = 0; i &lt; self.Count; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;        {&#xA;            if (self[i].Timestamp &gt; model.Timestamp)&#xA;            {&#xA;                index = i;&#xA;                break;&#xA;            }&#xA;        }&#xA;        self.Insert(index, model);&#xA;    }    &#xA;}&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;        public static class TimestampExtensions&#xA;{&#xA;    public static void AddInPlace(this IList&lt;SqlStatement&gt; self, SqlStatement model)&#xA;    {&#xA;        var timestamp = model.Timestamp;&#xA;        var index = self.Count;&#xA;        if (index &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; timestamp &gt;= self[index - 1].Timestamp)&#xA;        {&#xA;            self.Add(model);&#xA;            return;&#xA;        }&#xA;        for (var i = 0; i &lt; self.Count; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;        {&#xA;            if (self[i].Timestamp &lt; timestamp) &#xA;                continue;&#xA;            index = i;&#xA;            break;&#xA;        }&#xA;        self.Insert(index, model);&#xA;    }    &#xA;}&#xA;        &#xA;    &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Here we optimize for the common case where we add the statement to the end of the list. We also changed from generic method with interface constraint to the actual type used. That allows the JIT to apply additional optimizations. That method alone was responsible for almost 10 minutes in my test runs.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      Old code&#xA;&#xA;      New code&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        var statement = session.Statements&#xA;    .Reverse()&#xA;    .Where(x =&gt; x.SessionId.Timestamp &lt;= queryDuration.SessionId.Timestamp)&#xA;    .FirstOrDefault();&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;        var statement = session.Statements.LastOrDefault();&#xA;        &#xA;    &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;session.Statements is already ordered by the statements timestamps. The code perform a slightly differently here, and it is less robust to async message streaming (when events that happened sequentially arrive in different order than they occured), but that is rare enough that I feel that the performance boost from this is acceptable.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      Old code&#xA;&#xA;      New code&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        public override void AfterAttachingToSession(         SessionInformation sessionInformation, SqlStatement statement)&#xA;{&#xA;    var isSelectStatement = statement.IsSelectStatement;&#xA;    if (isSelectStatement == false)&#xA;        return;&#xA;&#xA;    if (statement.RawSql == mySqlSelectLastIdentity)&#xA;        return;&#xA;&#xA;    int countOfStatementsWithIdenticalSql = sessionInformation.Statements&#xA;        .Count(x =&gt; x.RawSql == statement.RawSql);&#xA;    if (countOfStatementsWithIdenticalSql &lt;         configuration.MaxRepeatedStatementsForSelectNPlusOne)&#xA;        return;&#xA;    statement.AcceptAlert(AlertInformation.SelectNPlusOne());&#xA;}&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;        public int GetCountOfStatementsByRawSql(string rawSql)&#xA;{&#xA;    int value;&#xA;    countsByRawSql.TryGetValue(rawSql, out value);&#xA;    return value;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public void AddStatement(SqlStatement statement)&#xA;{&#xA;    int count;&#xA;    if (countsByRawSql.TryGetValue(statement.RawSql, out count) == false)&#xA;        count = 0;&#xA;    countsByRawSql[statement.RawSql] = count &#x2B; 1;&#xA;    &#xA;    statements.AddInPlace(statement);&#xA;    StatementsChanged();&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;public override void AfterAttachingToSession(&#xA;    SessionInformation sessionInformation, SqlStatement statement)&#xA;{&#xA;    var isSelectStatement = statement.IsSelectStatement;&#xA;    if (isSelectStatement == false)&#xA;        return;&#xA;&#xA;    if (statement.RawSql == mySqlSelectLastIdentity)&#xA;        return;&#xA;&#xA;    if (sessionInformation.GetCountOfStatementsByRawSql(statement.RawSql) &lt; &#xA;        configuration.MaxRepeatedStatementsForSelectNPlusOne)&#xA;        return;&#xA;    statement.AcceptAlert(AlertInformation.SelectNPlusOne());&#xA;}&#xA;        &#xA;    &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;On the left, we have the old code, that did the calculations manually.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing in my exploration of the Effectus code base, which originated from my Building a Desktop To-Do Application with NHibernate article on MSDN Magazine, I wanted to talk today about separating features into individual pieces in the application.  Each feature in the Effectus application is built as an isolated unit, that has little to do with any other features. This is very clear when you look at how they are organized:  &#xA0;     Sidenote: In each feature, the component parts are named the same (Presenter, View, Model). This is intentional, since it make it that much harder to mix stuff from other features.     Every feature has a pretty rigid structure, defined by the application, and trying to reuse stuff between features is frowned upon and avoided, even if doing so can reduce duplication. As a good example, the Model for both CreateNew and Edit features are identical, but they are two different classes with no attempt to merge it up.  The reason for this is quite simple, treating each feature as an isolated unit bring us great benefits, we can have different developers working on different features without the chance of stepping on each other toes, it is very hard for one feature to break another, deploying new features is easier to handle, etc. Trying to apply DRY and consolidate common pieces of code would introduce dependencies between features, and that is a bad idea.  But what about communication between features? What about when one feature needs to call another?  As it turned out, it is quite easy to turn a lot of the inter feature communication into an indirect calls, using pub/sub. We gain the independence from dependencies using pub/sub, while maintaining the feel of a well integrated product for the user. For the rare cases of one feature calling another, I create a simple Call(&#x201C;FeatureName&#x201D;) mechanism (in the code, this is Presenters.Show(name) method) that all us to just explicitly invoke another feature, maybe with some initial arguments. A more complete implementation will handle even that using pub/sub, probably with an integrator class that would dispatch the appropriate event to start and invoke the feature(s) that want to handle it.  You can read more about the architecture principles behind this system in: Application structure: Concepts &amp; Features</p>
