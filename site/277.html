            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m really proud to announce that we have released the RavenDB 4.0 beta.&#xA0; It has been a bit over six months of so since the alpha release (I can&#x2019;t believe it has been that long), and we have been working hard on completing the feature set that we want to have for the final release. We are now ready to unveil RavenDB 4.0 and show you what we can do with it.Since the alpha release, we completed the refactoring to the clustering infrastructure, so a RavenDB node is always in a cluster (even if just a single one), added attachments, full database encryption and subscriptions, improved indexing performance and performance in general and had done a lot of work to make the database more accessible and easier to use. Cluster scenarios are easier and more robust, you can now take a database and span it on multiple nodes at will and you get the usual RavenDB safety, reliability and fault tolerance. Users coming from the RavenDB 3.x version will notice (immediately after the studio theme) that everything is much faster. Our internal testing shows anything between 10x to 100x improvement in speed over the previous version. RavenDB is now capable of handling over 100K req/second for writes (that is over hundred thousands requests per second), and much more for reads, with the&#xA0; caveat that we always hit the network capacity before we hit RavenDB&#x2019;s capacity. That is per node, so you can scale the number of nodes in the cluster, so can you scale the amount of reads and writes you can handle.RavenDB 4.0 also comes with much smarter query optimizer, allowing it to generate optimal queries for aggregation in addition to simple queries. And map/reduce in general has been worked heavily to make it much faster and more responsive. You can download the RavenDB 4.0 beta from our download page, and NuGet package is available by running:Install-Package RavenDB.Client -Version 4.0.0-beta-40014 -Source https://www.myget.org/F/ravendb/api/v3/index.jsonYou can run the beta on Windows, Linux, Raspberry PI and Docker, and you can access the live test instance to check it out. Known issues include:Identities aren&#x2019;t exported / importedCluster operations sometimes stall and timeout.The studio currently assumes that the user is administrator.Highlighting &amp; spatial searches aren&#x2019;t supported.Deployment in hardened environment is awkward.Upgrading from previous versions is only possible via smuggler.Custom analyzers are not currently supported.If you are upgrading from 3.x or the 4.0 Alpha, you&#x2019;ll need to export the data and import it again. Automatic upgrades will be part of the RC.Please remember, this is a beta. I included some of the known issues in this post to make sure that you remember that. We expect users to start developing with RavenDB 4.0 from the beta, and API and behavior are pretty fixed now. But you shouldn&#x2019;t be deploying to production with this, and you should be aware that upgrading from the beta to RC is going to be done using smuggler as well. We&#x2019;ll likely have a few beta releases on the road to RC, fixing all the issues that will pop up along the way. Your feedback is crucial at this stage, since subjecting RavenDB to real world conditions is the only way to battle test it.In the studio, you can use the feedback icon to send us your immediate feedback, and there is also the issue tracker.Take RavenDB for a spin, setup a node, setup a cluster, see how it all works together. If we did our job right, you should be able to figure out everything on your own, which is good, because the docs are still TBD. Feedback on bugs and issues is important, but I&#x2019;m also very interested in feedback on the flow. How easy it is to do things, deploy, setup, connect from the client, etc.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I talked about the new clustering mode in RavenDB 4.0 a few days ago. I realized shortly afterward that I didn&#x2019;t explain a crucial factor. RavenDB has several layers of distributed work.At the node level, all nodes are (always) part of a cluster. In some cases, it may be a cluster that is a single node, but in all cases, a node is part of a cluster. Cluster form a consensus between all the nodes (using Raft) and all cluster wide operations go through Raft.Cluster wide operations are things like creating a new database, or assigning a new node to the database and other things that are obviously cluster wide related. But a lot of other operations are also handled in this manner. Creating an index goes through Raft, for example. And so does high availability subscriptions and backup information. The idea is that the cluster holds the state of its databases, and all such state flow through Raft.A database can reside in multiple nodes, and we typically call that a database group (to distinguish from the cluster as a whole). Data written to the database does not go out over Raft. Instead, we use multi master distributed mesh to replication all data (documents, attachments, revisions, etc) between the different nodes in the database. Why is that? The logic that guides us is simple. Cluster wide operations happen a lot less often and require a lot more resiliency to operate properly. In particular, not doing consensus resulted in having to deal with potential conflicting changes, which was a PITA. On the other hand, common operations such as document writes tend to have a lot more stringent latency requirements, and what is more, we want to be able to accept writes even in the presence of failure. Consider a network split in a 3 nodes cluster, even though we cannot make modifications to the cluster state on the side with the single node, we are still able to accept and process write and read requests. When the split heals, we can merge all the changes between the nodes, potentially generating (and resolving) conflicts as needed. The basic idea is that for data that is stored in the database, we will always accept the write, because it it too important to let it just go poof. But for data about the database, we will ensure that we have a consensus for it, since almost all such operations are admin based and repeatable. Those two modes end up creating an interesting environment. At the admin level, they can work with the cluster and be sure that their changes are properly applied cluster wide. At the database level, each node will always accept writes to the database and distribute them across the cluster in a multi master fashion. A client can choose to accept a write to a single node or a to a particular number of nodes before considering a write successful, but even with network splits, we can still remain up and functioning. A database group has multiple nodes, and all of them are setup to replicate to one another in master/master setup as well as distribute whatever work is required of the database group (backups, ETL, etc). What about master/slave setups?We have the notion of adding an outgoing only connection to a database group, one of the nodes in the cluster will take ownership on that connection and replicate all data to it. That allow you to get master/slave, but we&#x2019;ll not failover to the other node, only to a node inside our own database group. Typical reasons for such a scenario is if you want to have a remote offsite node, or if you have the need to run complex / expensive operations on the system and you want to split that work away from the database group entirely.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Artificial documents are a really interesting feature. They allow you to define an index, and specify that the result of the index will be&#x2026; documents as well. Let us consider the following index, running on the Norhtwind dataset.We can ask RavenDB to output the result of this index to a collection, in addition to the normal indexing. This is done in the following manner:And you can see the result here:The question here is, what is the point? Don&#x2019;t we already have the exact same data indexed and available as the result of the map/reduce index? Why store it twice?The answer is quite simple, with the output of the index going into documents, we can now define additional indexes on top of them, which give us the option to very easily create recursive map/reduce operations. So you can do daily/monthly/yearly summaries very cheaply. We can also apply all the usual operations on documents (subscriptions and ETL processes come to mind immediately). That give you a lot of power, and without incurring a high complexity overhead.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This week or early next week, we&#x2019;ll have the RavenDB 4.0 beta out. I&#x2019;m really excited about this release, because it finalize a lot of our work for the past two years. In the alpha version, we were able to show off some major performance improvements and a few hints of the things that we had planned, but it was still at the infrastructure stage. Now we are talking about unveiling almost all of our new functionality and design.&#xA;The most obvious change you&#x2019;ll see is that we made a fundamental&#xA0; change in how we are handle clustering. In prior versions of RavenDB, clusters were created by connecting together database instances running on independent nodes. In RavenDB 4.0, each node is always a member of a cluster, and databases are distributed among those nodes. That sounds like a small distinction, but it completely reversed how we approach distributed work.&#xA;Let us consider three nodes that form a RavenDB cluster in RavenDB 3.x. Each database in RavenDB 3.x is an independent entity. You can setup replication between different databases and out of the cooperation of the different nodes and some client side help, we get robust high availability and failover. However, there is a lot of work that you need to do on all the nodes (setup master/master between all the nodes on each can grow very tedious). And while you get high availability for reads and writes, you don&#x2019;t get that for other tasks in the database.&#xA;Let us see how this works in RavenDB 4.0, shall we? The first thing we need to do is to spin up 3 nodes.&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, we have three nodes, and Node A has been selected as the leader.&#xA0; To simplify things to ourselves, we just assign arbitrary letters to the nodes. That allow us to refer to them as Node A, Node B, etc. Instead of something like WIN-MC2B0FG64GR. We also expose this information directly in the browser.&#xA;&#xA;Once the cluster has been created, we can create a database, and when we do that, we can either specify what the replication factor should be, or manually control what nodes this database will be on.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;Creating this database will create it on both A and C, but it will do a bit more than that. Those aren&#x2019;t independent databases that hooked together. This is actually the same database, running on two different nodes. I created the sample data on Node C, and this is what I see when I look on Node A.&#xA;&#xA;We can see that the data (indexes and documents) has been replicated. Now, let us see how we can work with this database:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

And you are correct, but there are some important differences. Instead of specifying a single server url, you can now specify several. And the actual url we provided doesn&#x2019;t make any sense at all. We are pointing it to Node B, running on port 8081. However, that node doesn&#x2019;t have the Northwind database. That is another important change. We can now go to any node in the cluster and ask for the topology of any database, and we&#x2019;ll get the current database topology to use.&#xA;That make it much simpler to work in a clustered environment. You can bring in additional nodes without having to update any configuration, and mix and match the topology of databases in the cluster freely.&#xA;Another aspect of this behavior is the notion of database tasks. Here are a few of them.&#xA;&#xA;Those are tasks (looks like we need to update the icon for backup) that are defined at the database level, and they are spread over all the nodes in the database automatically. So if we defined an ETL task and a scheduled backup, we&#x2019;ll typically see one node handling the backups and another handling the ETL. If there is a failure, the cluster will notice that and redistribute the work transparently.&#xA;We can also extend the database to additional nodes, and the cluster will setup the database on the new node, transfer all the data to it (by assigning a node to replicate all the data to the new node), wait until all the data and indexing is done and only then bring it up as a full fledged member of the database, available for failover and for handling all the routine tasks.&#xA;The idea is that you don&#x2019;t work with each node independently, but the cluster as a whole. You can then define a database on the cluster, and the rest is managed for you. The topology, the tasks, failover and client integration, the works.</p>
