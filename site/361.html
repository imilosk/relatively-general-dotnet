            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most challenging things to do in production is to know what is going on? In order to facilitate that, we have dedicate some time to exposing the internal guts of RavenDB to the outside world (assuming that the outside world has the appropriate permissions). One way to look at that is to subscribe to the log stream from RavenDB, you can do it like this:  This gives you the following:  Note that this requires no configuration changes, or restarting the server or database. As long as your logs subscription is active, we&#x2019;ll send you a live stream of all the log activity in RavenDB, which should allow you to get a lot of useful insights about what exactly it is that RavenDB is doing. This is especially important if you need to do any sort of trouble shooting, because that is when you need to have logs, and restarting the server to enable them is often out of the question (it would likely resolve the issue you want to understand). And honestly, this is a feature that we need to support customers, it is going to be much easier to just say &#x201C;let us look at the logs&#x201D;, rather than having to go over how to configure them, etc. Another thing to note is the fact that this can all be done remotely, you don&#x2019;t have to have access to the physical server. It does require you to have admin permissions on the server, so not any user can do that. Another production view that is available to you is the Traffic Watcher:  This gives you the option of looking at the requests that are actually hitting the server. It is a subset of information from the logs, but it is usually a lot more interesting to watch. And again, this can be done remotely as well. You can watch all databases, or just a single one. But most importantly from support perspective is the new Debug Info! package. And yes, it deserver the bang in the name. What this does is gather a lot of important information from the database, all the current stats, and a lot of stuff that we need to figure out what is going on. The idea is that if you have a problem, we won&#x2019;t have to ask for a lot of separate pieces of information, you can get it all as a single shot. Oh, and we can also grab the actual stack trace information from your system, so we even know exactly what your system is doing.  In my next post, I&#x2019;ll discuss one last operational concern, optimizations.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This has been the most important change in RavenDB 3.0, in my opinion. Not because of complexity and scope, pretty much everything here is much simpler than other features than we have done. But this is important because it makes RavenDB much easier to operate. Since the get go, we have tried to make sure that RavenDB would be a low friction system. We usually focused on the developer experience, and that showed when we had to deal with operational issues.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Things were more complex than they should. Now, to be fair, we had the appropriate facilities to figure things out, ranging from debug endpoints, to performance counters to a great debug log story. The problem is that in my eye, we were merely on par with other systems. RavenDB wasn&#x2019;t created to be on par, RavenDB was created so when you use this, you would sigh and say &#x201C;that is how it should be done&#x201D;. With RavenDB 3.0, I think we are much closer to that.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Because we have done so much work here, I&#x2019;m going to split things to multiple posts. This one is the one with all the pretty pictures, as you can imagine. Next one will talk about the actual operational behavior changes we made.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Let me go over some of those things with you. Here you can see the stats view, including looking at an index details.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That is similar to what we had before. But it gets interesting when we want to start actually looking at the data more deeply. Here are the indexing stats on my machine:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You can see that the Product/Sales index has a big fanout, by the fact that it has more items out than in, for example. You can also see how much items we indexed per batch, and how we do parallel indexing.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We also have a lot more metrics to look at. The current requests view along several time frames.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The live index work view:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The indexing batch size and the perfetching stats graph gives us live memory consumption usage for indexing, as well as some view on what indexing strategy is currently in use.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Combining those stats, we have a lot of information at our fingertips, and can get a better idea about what exactly is going on inside RavenDB.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But so far, this is just to look at things, let us see what else we can do. RavenDB does a lot of things in the background. From bulk insert work to set based operations. We added a view that let you see those tasks, and cancel them if you need to:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You can now see all the work done by the replication background processes, which will give you a better idea on what your cluster is doing. And of course there is the topology view that we already looked at.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We also added views for most of the debug endpoints that RavenDB has. Here we are looking at the subscribed changes connections.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We get a lot of metrics available for us now. In fact, we went a bit crazy there and started tracking a lot of stuff. This will help you understand what is going on internally. And you can also get nice histograms.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;There is a lot of stuff there, so I won&#x2019;t cover it all, but I would show you what I think is one of the nicest features:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This will give you real stats about resource usage in your system. Including counts of documents per collection and the size on disk.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Okay, that is enough with the pretty pictures, on my next post, I&#x2019;ll talk about the actual changes we made to support operations better.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">SQL Replication has been a part of RavenDB for quite some time,showing up for the first time in the 1.0 build as the Index Replication Bundle. This turned out to be a very useful feature, and in 3.0 we had a dedicated developer for this for several weeks, banging it into new and interesting shapes.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We started out with a proper design for how you want to use it. And I&#x2019;m just going to take you through the process for a bit, then talk about the backend changes.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We start by defining a named connection string (note that you can actually test this immediately):&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And then we define the actual replication behavior:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Note that we have the Tools control in the top? Clicking it and selecting Simulate will give you:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;So you can actually see the commands that we are going to execute to replicate a specific document. That is going to save a lot of head scratching about &#x201C;why isn&#x2019;t this replicating properly&#x201D;.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You can even run this simulation against your source db, to check for errors such as constraint violations, etc.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The SQL Replication bundle now support forcing query recompilation, which avoid bad query plans caching in SQL Server:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And for the prudent DBA, we have done a lot to give you additional information. In particular, you can look at the metrics and see what is going on.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In this case, I actually don&#x2019;t have a relational database on this machine to test this, but I&#x2019;m sure that you can figure it out.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The nice thing about it, we&#x2019;ll report separate metrics per table, so your DBA can see if a particular table is causing a slow down.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Overall, we streamlined everything and tried to give you as much information upfront as possible, as well as tracking the entire process. You&#x2019;ll find it much easier to work with and troubleshoot if needed.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This actually ties very well with our next topic, the operations changes in RavenDB to make it easier to manager. But that will be in the a future post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Replication is kinda important to RavenDB. It is the building block for high availability and transparent failover, it is how we do scale out in many cases. I think that you won&#x2019;t be surprised to hear that we have done a lot of work around that area as well.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Some of that was internal, just optimizing how we are doing things. One such case was optimizing the addition of a new node to a cluster. Previously, that would mean that are carefully laid out plans for how to allocate memory for replication would have to be disrupted, and a lot of the time, we would need to do extra work to server both existing and new replication destinations. In RavenDB 3.0, we have specifically addressed this, and now we can do much better for this scenario, or even the more common one when you have one slower node.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But for the most part, a lot of the changes that has been made were done to make it easier to work with replication. The following screen shot shows a lot of the new features all at once:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Now, instead of defining the failover replication behavior on a client side (which meant that different clients could have different failover behavior), we define this behavior on the server side (note that server side behavior will override the client side behavior). This means that your admin can change the cluster from master/slave to the multi master topology and you won&#x2019;t have to change your code, it will be picked by the clients automatically.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Conflict resolution has also became easier. RavenDB now ships with three automatic conflict resolvers (prefer local, prefer remote, prefer latest). Another one is planned for post 3.0, which will allow you to write a server side conflict resolution script to handle custom logic.&#xA0; Of course, the usual conflict resolutions (client side listener, server side trigger) are still there and humming along quite nicely.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Below the replication destinations, you can see the server hilo prefix. This is a feature we had in RavenDB for several years, but it has never been really utilized. This allows multiple servers to accept new documents concurrently without having to fear conflicting ids.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another feature that we added was better tracking of the health of the entire cluster. One part of that is the ability to visualize the topology:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;From the client side of things, the behavior of the client in the presence of failure has been greatly improved. We do automatic failover, of course, but now we do the health checks of the down servers as a background task. That means that after the initial &#x201C;server is down&#x201D; shock, we immediately switch over to the secondary nodes, and we&#x2019;ll handle the primary recovering and switch back to it within a few seconds. That means that we won&#x2019;t have the complex backoff strategy or the hit that this took when every N request.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another change we made to the client side was the ability to explicitly define the failover configuration on the client. That was a feature that people requested, mostly to handle the &#x201C;we start the first time and the server is down&#x201D; scenario. Not an hugely common situation, but it completes the entire feature set quite nicely.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB is an ACID database for documents, and it is a BASE database for queries. That design principle has serve us very well since the start, because it allow us to modify the way we are handling things internally without violating the promises we give to the user.&#xA0; In particular, the ability to hand out potentially stale information has been crucial for a lot of performance optimizations in RavenDB.  That said, while is has been a core feature of RavenDB from the start, I haven&#x2019;t found a single user who had a hankering for longer staleness latency. That is a long way to say that we managed to reduce further the number of times RavenDB will return query results marked as stale. We have talked about some of this in the previous posts, with regards to better batching and optimization in the indexing process itself, but we already talked about this. In RavenDB 3.0, we are using smarter algorithm to detect if an index has potentially changed, in particular, we can detect if the index isn&#x2019;t covering any of the changed documents that it hasn&#x2019;t had a chance to index yet. If we know that no document yet to be indexed is going to be indexed by this index, we can short circuit indexing and declare the index as non stale. In practice, this should resolve a common misconception &#x201C;I changed one document, all indexes became stale&#x201D; by having a better match between what the user thinks is going on and the externally observed behavior. Your applications would be a little faster, but that should be the sole difference from your point of view. Another change that does require you to take active action is nested transformers. The idea is that transformers often encompass some piece of business logic related to how to pull an entity / entities for a particular task. It would be nice not to have to duplicate this logic (and maintain it over time). With RavenDB 3.0, you can now nest transformers and have one transformer call another to do some part of the work. Here is how this looks:  //ProductsTransformerTransformResults = products =&gt;    from doc in products    select new    {        Name = doc.Name.Reverse()    };// another transformerTransformResults = products =&gt;    from doc in products    select new    {        Product = doc,        Transformed = TransformWith(&quot;ProductTransformer&quot;, doc)    };&#xA;The 2nd transformer calls to the ProductsTransformer by name, allow it to run its own processing (and potentially call yet another transformer, etc). Note that a transformer cannot recurse either directly on indirectly. In other words ,you cannot call yourself, or another transformer that has called you.&#xA;There has been a lot of other changes, of course, but a lot of them are too small to merit such a mention. Better support for querying unsigned integers is hardly earth shattering. But there has been a lot of those kind of changes. It means that you&#x2019;ll have a smoother experience overall. &#xA;Next post, replication .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We talked a lot about the changes we made for indexing, now let us talk about the kind of changes we are talking about from the query side of things. More precisely, this is when we start asking questions about our queries.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Timing queries. While it is rare that we have slow queries in RavenDB, it does happen, and when it does, we treat it very seriously. However, in the last few cases that we have seen, the actual problem wasn&#x2019;t with RavenDB, it was with sending the data back to the client when we had a large result set and large number of documents.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In RavenDB 3.0, we have added the ability to get detailed statistics about what is the cost of the query in every stage of the pipeline.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;RavenQueryStatistics stats;&#xA;var users = session.Query&lt;Order&gt;(&quot;Orders/Totals&quot;)&#xA;    .Statistics(out stats)&#xA;    .Customize(x =&gt; x.ShowTimings())&#xA;    .Where(x=&gt;x.Company == &quot;companies/11&quot; || x.Employee == &quot;employees/2&quot;)&#xA;    .ToList();&#xA;&#xA;foreach (var kvp in stats.TimingsInMilliseconds)&#xA;{&#xA;    Console.WriteLine(kvp.Key &#x2B; &quot;: &quot; &#x2B; kvp.Value);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;Console.WriteLine(&quot;Total: &quot; &#x2B; stats.DurationMilliseconds);&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We can now ask RavenDB to explain us its reasoning when doing so:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Lucene search: 10&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Loading documents: 2&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Transforming results: 0&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Total: 21&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;As you can see, the total time for this query is 21 ms, and we have 12 ms accounted for in the actual search time. The rest is network traffic.&#xA0; This can help you diagnose more easily where the problem is, and hence, how to solve it.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Query timeout and cancellation. As I mentioned, we don&#x2019;t really have long queries in RavenDB very often. But that is actually is something that happens, and we need a way to deal with that. RavenDB now places a timeout on the amount of time a query gets to run (including querying Lucene, loading documents or transforming the results). A query that doesn&#x2019;t complete in time will be cancelled, and an error will be returned to the user.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You can also view the currently executing queries and kill a long running query (if you have specified a high timeout, for example).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Explaining queries. Sometimes it is easy to understand why RavenDB has decided to give you documents in a certain order. You asked them sorted by date, and you get them sorted by date. But when you are talking about complex queries, that is much harder. RavenDB will sort the results by default based on relevancy, and that can sometimes be a bit puzzling to understand.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is how we can do this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;session.Advanced.DocumentQuery&lt;Order&gt;(&quot;Orders/Totals&quot;)&#xA;                    .Statistics(out stats)&#xA;                    .WhereEquals(&quot;Company&quot;, &quot;companies/11&quot;)&#xA;                    .WhereEquals(&quot;Employee&quot;, &quot;employees/3&quot;)&#xA;                    .ExplainScores()&#xA;                    .ToList();&#xA;&#xA;var explanation = stats.ScoreExplantaions[&quot;orders/759&quot;];&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The result of this would be something that looks like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;0.6807194 = (MATCH) product of:&#xA;  1.361439 = (MATCH) sum of:&#xA;    1.361439 = (MATCH) weight(Employee:employees/3 in 469), product of:&#xA;      0.4744689 = queryWeight(Employee:employees/3), product of:&#xA;        2.869395 = idf(docFreq=127, maxDocs=830)&#xA;        0.165355 = queryNorm&#xA;      2.869395 = (MATCH) fieldWeight(Employee:employees/3 in 469), product of:&#xA;        1 = tf(termFreq(Employee:employees/3)=1)&#xA;        2.869395 = idf(docFreq=127, maxDocs=830)&#xA;        1 = fieldNorm(field=Employee, doc=469)&#xA;  0.5 = coord(1/2)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And if we were to ask for the explanation for orders/237, we will get:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;6.047595 = (MATCH) sum of:&#xA;  4.686156 = (MATCH) weight(Company:companies/11 in 236), product of:&#xA;    0.8802723 = queryWeight(Company:companies/11), product of:&#xA;      5.32353 = idf(docFreq=10, maxDocs=830)&#xA;      0.165355 = queryNorm&#xA;    5.32353 = (MATCH) fieldWeight(Company:companies/11 in 236), product of:&#xA;      1 = tf(termFreq(Company:companies/11)=1)&#xA;      5.32353 = idf(docFreq=10, maxDocs=830)&#xA;      1 = fieldNorm(field=Company, doc=236)&#xA;  1.361439 = (MATCH) weight(Employee:employees/3 in 236), product of:&#xA;    0.4744689 = queryWeight(Employee:employees/3), product of:&#xA;      2.869395 = idf(docFreq=127, maxDocs=830)&#xA;      0.165355 = queryNorm&#xA;    2.869395 = (MATCH) fieldWeight(Employee:employees/3 in 236), product of:&#xA;      1 = tf(termFreq(Employee:employees/3)=1)&#xA;      2.869395 = idf(docFreq=127, maxDocs=830)&#xA;      1 = fieldNorm(field=Employee, doc=236)&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In other words, we can see that orders/237 is ranked much higher than orders/759. That is because is matched both clauses of the query. And a match on Company is a much stronger indication for relevancy because Companies/11 appears only in 10 documents out out 830, while Employees/3 appears in 127 out of 830.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;For details about this format, see this presentation, it actually talks about Solr here, but this data comes from Lucene, so it applies to both.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That is it about queries diagnostics, next, we&#x2019;ll deal with transformers and another important optimization, the staleness reduction system.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We talked previously about the kind of improvements we have in RavenDB 3.0 for the indexing backend. In this post, I want to go over a few features that are much more visible.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Attachment indexing. This is a feature that I am not so hot about, mostly because we want to move all attachment usages to RavenFS. But in the meantime, you can reference the contents of an attachment during index. That can let you do things like store large text data in an attachment, but still make it available for the indexes. That said, there is no tracking of the attachment, so if it change, the document that referred to it won&#x2019;t be re-indexed as well. But for the common case where both the attachments and the documents are always changed together, that can be a pretty nice thing to have.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Optimized new index creation. In RavenDB 2.5, creating a new index would force us to go over all of the documents in the database, not just the documents that we have in that collection. In many cases, that surprised users, because they expected there to be some sort of physical separation between the collections. In RavenDB 3.0, we changed things so creating a new index on a small collection (by default, less than 131,072 items) will be able to only touch the documents that belong to the collections being covered by that index. This alone represent a pretty significant change in the way we are processing indexes.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In practice, this means that creating a new index on a small index would complete much more rapidly. For example, I reset an index on a production instance, it covers about 7,583 documents our of 19,191. RavenDB was able to index that in just 690 ms, out of about 3 seconds overall that took for the index reset to take place.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;What about the cases where we have new indexes on large collections? At this point, in 2.5, we would do round robin indexing between the new index and the existing ones. The problem was that 2.5 was biased toward the new index. That meant that it was busy indexing the new stuff, while the existing indexes (which you are actually using) took longer to run. Another problem was that in 2.5 creating a new index would effectively poison a lot of performance heuristics.&#xA0; Those were built for the assumptions of all indexes running pretty much in tandem. And when we have one or more that weren&#x2019;t doing so&#x2026; well, that caused things to be more expensive.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In 3.0, we have changed how this works. We&#x2019;ll have separate performance optimization pipelines for each group of indexes based on its rough indexing position. That lets us take advantage of batching many indexes together. We are also not going to try to interleave the indexes (running first the new index and then the existing ones). Instead, we&#x2019;ll be running all of them in parallel, to reduce stalls and to increase the speed in which everything comes up to speed.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This is using our scheduling engine to ensure that we aren&#x2019;t actually overloading the machine with computation work (concurrent indexing) or memory (number of items to index at once). I&#x2019;ve very proud in what we have done here, and even though this is actually a backend feature, it is too important to get lost in the minutia of all the other backend indexing changes we talked about in my previous post.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Explicit Cartesian/fanout indexing. A Cartesian index (we usually call them fanout indexes) is an index that output multiple index entries per each document. Here is an example of such an index:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;from postComment in docs.PostComments&#xA;from comment in postComment.Comments&#xA;where comment.IsSpam == false&#xA;select new {&#xA;    CreatedAt = comment.CreatedAt,&#xA;    CommentId = comment.Id,&#xA;    PostCommentsId = postComment.__document_id,&#xA;    PostId = postComment.Post.Id,&#xA;    PostPublishAt = postComment.Post.PublishAt&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;For a large post, with a lot of comments, we are going to get an entry per comment. That means that a single document can generate hundreds of index entries.&#xA0; Now, in this case, that is actually what I want, so that is fine.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But there is a problem here. RavenDB has no way of knowing upfront how many index entries a document will generate, that means that it is very hard to allocate the appropriate amount of memory reserves for this, and it is possible to get into situations where we simply run out of memory. In RavenDB 3.0, we have added explicit instructions for this. An index has a budget, by default, each document is allowed to output up to 15 entries. If it tries to output more than 15 entries, that document indexing is aborted, and it won&#x2019;t be indexed by this index.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You can override this option either globally, or on an index by index basis, to increase the number of index entries per document that are allowed for an index (and old indexes will have a limit of 16,384 items, to avoid breaking existing indexes).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The reason that this is done is so either you didn&#x2019;t specify a value, in which case we are limited to the default 15 index entries per document, or you did specify what you believe is a maximum number of index entries outputted per document, in which case we can take advantage of that when doing capacity planning for memory during indexing.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Simpler auto indexes. This feature is closely related to the previous one. Let us say that we want to find all users that have an admin role and has an unexpired credit card. We do that using the following query:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;var q = from u in session.Query&lt;User&gt;()&#xA;        where u.Roles.Any(x=&gt;x.Name == &quot;Admin&quot;) &amp;&amp; u.CreditCards.Any(x=&gt;x.Expired == false)&#xA;        select u;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In RavenDB 2.5, we would generate the following index to answer this query:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;from doc in docs.Users&#xA;from docCreditCardsItem in ((IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;)doc.CreditCards).DefaultIfEmpty()&#xA;from docRolesItem in ((IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;)doc.Roles).DefaultIfEmpty()&#xA;select new {&#xA;    CreditCards_Expired = docCreditCardsItem.Expired,&#xA;    Roles_Name = docRolesItem.Name&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And in RavenDB 3.0 we generate this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;from doc in docs.Users&#xA;select new {&#xA;    CreditCards_Expired = (&#xA;        from docCreditCardsItem in ((IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;)doc.CreditCards).DefaultIfEmpty()&#xA;        select docCreditCardsItem.Expired).ToArray(),&#xA;    Roles_Name = (&#xA;        from docRolesItem in ((IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;)doc.Roles).DefaultIfEmpty()&#xA;        select docRolesItem.Name).ToArray()&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Note the difference between the two. The 2.5 would generate multiple index entries per document, while RavenDB 3.0 generate just one. What is worse is that 2.5 would generate a Cartesian product, so the number of index entries outputted in 2.5 would be the number of roles for a user times the number of credit cards they have.&#xA0; In RavenDB 3.0, we have just one entry, and the overall cost is much reduced. It was a big change, but I think it was well worth it, considering the alternative.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In my next post, I&#x2019;ll talk about the other side of indexing, queries. Hang on, we still have a lot to go through.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB indexes are one of the things that make is more than a simple key/value store. They are incredibly important for us. And like many other pieces in 3.0, they have had a lot of work done, and now they are sparkling &amp; shiny. In this post I&#x2019;m going to talk about a lot of the backend changes that were made to indexing, making them faster, more reliable and better all around. In the next post, I&#x2019;ll discuss the actual user visible features we added.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Indexing to memory. Time and time again we have seen that actually hitting the disk is a good way of saying &#x201C;Sayonara, perf&#x201D;. In 2.5, we introduced the notion of building new indexes in RAM only, to speed up the I/O for new index creation. With 3.0, we have taken this further and indexes no longer go to disk as often. Instead, we index to an in memory buffer, and only write to disk once we hit a size/time/work limit.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;At that point, we&#x2019;ll flush those indexes to disk, and continue to buffer in memory. The idea is to reduce the amount of disk I/O that we do, as well as batch it to reduce the amount of time we spend hitting the disk.&#xA0; Under high load, this can dramatically improve performance, because we are I/O bound so much. In fact, for the common load spike scenario, we never have to hit the disk for indexing at all.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Aysnc index deletion. Indexes in RavenDB are composed of the actual indexed data, as well as the relevant metadata about the index. Usually, metadata is much smaller than the actual data. But in this case, an index metadata in the case of a map/reduce index include all of the intermediary steps in the process, so we can do incremental map/reduce. If you use LoadDocument, we need to maintain the documents references, and on large databases, that can take a lot of space. As a result of that, index deletion could take a long time in RavenDB 2.5.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;With RavenDB 3.0, we are now doing async index deletions, so you can delete the index, which does a very short operation to free up the index name, but do the actual work to cleanup after the index in the background. And yes, you can restart the database midway through, and it will resume the async index deletion behavior. The immediate behavior is that it is much easier to manage indexes, because you delete a big index and not have to wait for this to continue. This most commonly showed up when updating an index definition.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Index ids instead of names. Because we had to break the 1:1 association between index and its name, we moved to an internal representation of indexes using numeric ids. That was pretty much forced on us because we had to distinguish between the old index Users/Search (who is now in the process of being deleted) and the new Users/Search index (who is now in the process of being indexed).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;A happy side effect of that was that we actually has a more efficient internal structure for working with indexes in general. That speeds up writes and reads and reduce the overall disk space that is used.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Interleaves indexing &amp; task executions. RavenDB uses the term task to refer to cleanup jobs (mostly) that run on the indexes. For example, removing deleted index entries, or re-indexing referencing documents when the referenced document has changed. In 2.5, it was possible to get a lot of tasks in the queue, which would stall indexing. For example, mass deletes were one common scenario were the task queue would be full and take a bit to drain. In RavenDB 3.0 we have changed things so a big task queue won&#x2019;t impact indexing to that extent. Instead, we can interleave indexing and task execution so we won&#x2019;t stall the indexing process.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Large documents indexing. RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t place arbitrary limits on the size of documents. That is great as a user, but it places a whole set of challenges for RavenDB when we need to index. Assume that we want to introduce a new index of a relatively large collection of documents. We will start indexing the collection, realize that there is a lot to index, so we&#x2019;ll grow the number of items to be indexed in each batch. The problem is that is is pretty common that as the system grows, so does the documents. So a lot of the documents that were updated later on would be bigger than those we had initially. That can get to a point where we are trying to fetch a batch size of 128K documents, but each of them is 250Kb in size. That requires us to load 31 GB of documents to index in a single batch.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That might take a while, even if we are talking just about reading them from disk, leaving aside the cost in memory. This was worse because in many cases, when having so much data, the users would usually go for the compression bundle. So when RavenDB tried to figure out what is the size of the documents (by checking its on disk size), it would get the compressed size. Hilarity did not ensue as a result, I tell you that. In 3.0, we are better prepared to handle such scenarios, and we know to count the size of the document in memory, as well as being more proactive about limiting the amount of memory we&#x2019;ll use per batch.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I/O bounded batching. A core scenario for RavenDB is running on the cloud platforms. We have customers running us on anything from i2.8xlarge EC2 instances (32 cores, 244GB RAM, 8 x 800 GB SSD drives) to A0 Azure instances (shared CPU, 768 MB RAM, let us not talk about the disks, lest I cry). We actually got customers complaints about &#x201C;Why isn&#x2019;t RavenDB using all of the resources available to it&#x201D;, because we could handle the load in about 1/4 of the resources that the machine in question had available. Their capacity calculations were based on another database product, and RavenDB works very differently, so while they had no performance complaints, there were kinda upset that we weren&#x2019;t using more CPU/RAM &#x2013; they paid for those, so we should use them.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Funny as that might seem, the other side is not much better. The low end cloud machines are slow, and starved of just about any resource that you can name. In particular, I/O rates for the low end cloud machines are pretty much abysmal. If you created a new index on an existing database in one of those machine, it would turn out that a lot of what you did was just wait for I/O. The problem would actually grow worse over time. We were loading a small batch (took half a second to load from disk) and indexing it. Then we loaded another batch, and another, etc. As we realized that we have a lot to go through, we increased the batch size. But the time we would spend waiting for disk would grow higher and higher.&#xA0; From the admin perspective, it would appears as if we were hanging, and not actually doing any indexing.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In RavenDB 3.0, we are not bounding the I/O costs, so we&#x2019;ll try to load a batch for a while, but if we can&#x2019;t get enough in a reasonable time frame, we&#x2019;ll just give you what we already have so far, let you index that, and continue the I/O operation in a background thread. The idea is that by the time you are done indexing, you&#x2019;ve another batch of documents available for you. Combined with the batch index writes, that gave us a hell of a perceived performance boost (oh, it is indexing all the time, and I can see that it is doing a lot of I/O and CPU, so everything is good) and real actual gains (we were able to better parallelize the load process this way).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Summary &#x2013; pretty much all of those changes are not something that you&#x2019;ll really see. There are all engine changes that happen behind the scene. But all of them are going to work together to end up giving you a smoother, faster and overall better experience.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m not sure that there is a better word to describe it. We have a sign in the office, 3 feet by 6 feet that says: Reduce Friction. And that is something that we tried very hard to do.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Under simplicity we aggregate everything that might aggravate you, and what we did to reduce that.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That include things like reducing the number of files and assemblies we ship. Compare the 2.5 output:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;To the 3.0 output:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We did that by removing a lot of dependencies that we could do without, and internalizing a lot of the other stuff.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We went over the command line interface of the tooling we use and upgraded that. For example, restoring via the command line is now split into a restoring a system database (offline operation for the entire server) or restoring a regular database (the server is fully online, and other databases can run during this time).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In secret and without telling anyone, we have also doubled the amount of parallel work that RavenDB can do. Previously, if you purchased a standard license, you were limited to 6 concurrent index tasks, for example. In RavenDB 3.0, the standard license still has 6 cores capacity, but it will allow up to 12 concurrent index tasks. If you have a 32 cores Enterprise license, that would mean 64 concurrent indexing tasks, and you can follow the logic from there, I asuume.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We have also dropped the Raven.Client.Embedded assembly. It isn&#x2019;t necessary. The full functionality is still available, of course, it was just moved to Raven.Database assembly. That reduce the amount of dlls that you have to work with and manage.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You probably don&#x2019;t care much, but we have done a lot of refactoring on the internals of RavenDB. The DocumentDatabase class (the core functionality in RavenDB) was broken up into many separate classes, and on the client side, we have done much the same to the DocumentStore class. We have also combined several listeners together, so now you don&#x2019;t have to deal with Extended Conversion Listeners.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In terms of storage, obviously Voron gives us a huge boost, and it is designed to be a zero admin system that self optimize. But we changed things on top of that as well. Previously, we were storing the data as BSON on disk. That decision had a lot to do with serialization costs and the size on disk. However, that created issues when we had to deal with the storage at a low level. So now RavenDB stores the data in text JSON format all the way through. And yes, it will seamlessly convert from BSON to JSON when you update documents, you don&#x2019;t have to do anything to get it working. We run extensive performance testing here, and it turned out that we were able to reduce the cost of writing by moving to a textual format.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another small annoyance with RavenDB was the use of in memory databases. Those are usually used for testing, but we also have a number of clients that use those for production data, usually as a high throughput first responder, with replication to / from backend systems to ensure durability. Previously, you had to manually tell RavenDB that it shouldn&#x2019;t tear down those database when they went idle. Now we won&#x2019;t tear down an in memory database even if it didn&#x2019;t do anything for a long while.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another common issues was people adding / removing bundles on the fly. This isn&#x2019;t supported, and it can cause issues because it usually works, but not always. We made it so the process for doing that is a bit more involved, and require an actual acknowledgment that you are doing something that might be unsafe.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Users sometimes have proxies / man in the middle service that manipulate the HTTP headers. A common example of that is New Relic. That can cause problems sometimes, since RavenDB use HTTP headers to pass the document metadata, that caused issues. By now, we have pretty much filtered out all the common stuff, but since that always required us to make a new release, that had a prohibitive cost of the users. Instead, we now allow you to customize the list of headers that the server will ignore on the fly.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We did a lot for indexes in 3.0, but one of the changes is both simple and meaningful. We gave you the ability to ask if my current index definition matches the one on the server? That is important during deployments, because you can check if an index is up to date or not, and then decide if you need to do an online index rebuild, or schedule this for a later time, with less load, or just move on because everything is the same.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In RavenDB 3.0, we have deprecated the attachments, they still work (but will be removed in the next major release), but you are expected to use RavenFS for binary storage. RavenDB now comes with a migration tool to move all attachments from a RavenDB database to a RavenFS file system.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;As I said, those are small things, none of them would rise to the level of major feature on its own. In aggregate (and I mentioned just the top from a very big list) they represent a significant reduction in the amount of friction that you have to deal with when using RavenDB.</p>
