        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A few weeks ago we started looking into what it would take to run RavenDB 4.0 over HTTPS. Oh, not the actual mechanics of that, we had that covered a long time ago, and pretty much everything worked as expected. No, the problem that we set out to solve was whatever we could get RavenDB to Just Work over HTTPS without requiring the admin to jump through hops. Basically, what I really wanted was a way to just spin up the server and have it running on HTTPS by default.That turned out to be a lot harder then I wished it would be. HTTPS has two very distinct goals:To encrypt communication between two parties.To ensure that the site you visited is actually the site you thought you visited.The first portion can be handled by generating the certificate yourself, and the communication between client &amp; server would be encrypted. So far so good, but the second portion is probably more important. If my communication with ThisIsNotPayPal.com is encrypted, that doesn&#x2019;t really help me all that much, I&#x2019;m afraid. Verifying who you are is a very important component of HTTPS, and that is something that we can&#x2019;t just ignore. Well, technically speaking I guess that RavenDB could have installed a root CA into the system during installation, but the mere thought of doing that is giving me a pause, so I really don&#x2019;t want to try and do that.And without doing that, we can&#x2019;t really support HTTPS. Remember that things like Let&#x2019;s Encrypt won&#x2019;t work here. RavenDB is often deployed on closed networks, and without having a publicly visible domain to run. My RavenDB is running on oren-pc.hrhinos.local, for example, and I think you&#x2019;ll find that it is a bit hard to get a Let&#x2019;s Encrypt certificate for this.So we can&#x2019;t just magically get a certificate and have it work. While I wish there was a way to just have encryption over the wire, without validation of identity, that would be pretty pointless with such things as man in the middle attacks.So what do we do in RavenDB 4.0 with regards to HTTPS? We rely on the admin (shocking, I know). They can either generate a self signed certificate and trust it ( a matter of a few shell commands on any platform ) or use their organization&#x2019;s certificate (either trusted internally or externally obtained). RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t care about that, but if you provide a certificate, it will ensure that all communication are SSL encrypted.The client API exposes a method that let you control certificate validation, which make it easier if you need to customize the authentication policy. On the server side, however, we take things differently. Instead of letting the user configure trust policies in certificates, we decided to ignore the issue completely. Or, to be rather more exact, to specify that RavenDB is going to lean on the operating system for such decisions. A simple scenario is an administrator that define a cluster of servers and generate a self signed certificate(s) for them to use. The administrator need to make sure that the certificate(s) in question are trusted by all nodes in the cluster. RavenDB will refuse to connect over HTTPS to an untrusted source. Yes, I&#x2019;m aware of all the horrible things that this can do (certificate expiration kills the system, for example), but we couldn&#x2019;t think of any way were not doing this wouldn&#x2019;t result in even worse situations. RavenDB has support for encrypted databases, but we don&#x2019;t allow them to be accessed from non secured connection, or to connect to non secure destinations. So the data is encrypted at rest and over the wire, and the admin is responsible to making sure that the certs are up to date and valid (or at least trusted by the machines in question).</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of very conscious choices we made in RavenDB 4.0 is to use threads. Not just run code that is multi threaded, but actively use the notion of a dedicated thread per task.In fact, most of the work in RavenDB (beyond servicing requests) is done by a dedicated thread. Each index, for example, has its own thread, transactions are merged and pushed using (mostly) a single thread. Replication is using dedicated threads, and so does the cluster communication mechanism. That runs contrary to advice that I have been told many times, that threads are expensive resource and that we should not hold up a thread if we can use async operations to give it up as soon as possible. And to a certain extent, I still very much believe it. Certainly all our request processing is using this manner. But as we got faster and faster we observed some really hard issues with using thread pools, since you can&#x2019;t rely on them executing a particular request in a given time frame, and having a mix bag of operations in a thread pool is a mix for slowing the whole thing down.Dedicated threads give us a lot of control and simplicity, from the ability to control the priority of certain tasks to the ability to debug and blame them properly.For example, here is how a portion of the threads on a running RavenDB server look like in the debugger:And done of our standard endpoints can give you thread timing for all the various tasks we do, so if there is an expensive thing going on, you can tell, and you can act accordingly. All of this has also led to an architecture that is mostly about independent thread doing their job in isolation, which means that a lot of the backend code in RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about threading concerns. And debugging it is as simple as stepping through it. That isn&#x2019;t true for request processing threads, which are heavily async, so they are all doing mostly reads. Even when you are actually sending a write to RavenDB, what is actually happening is that we have the request thread parse the request, then queue it up for the transaction merging thread to actually process it. That means that there is usually little (if any) contention on locks throughout the system.It is a far simpler model, and it has proven itself capable of making a very complex system understandable and maintainable for us.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Today I had a really strange revelation. We had an issue that related to race conditions in a distributed group, and we could just not figure out what was going on from the tests.Then we switch to a production mode, where each node was a separate process, and we debugged one of them. And it was easy, and it was obvious, and everything just worked.&#xA0; That was a profound revelation. What happened was that we build our system so we can service them in production, that includes the internal design and exposed instrumentation data that we have. When we were trying to figure things out from the tests, we were running everything in a single process, and the act of trying to debug a single thread would cause all other threads to stop. That would trigger cascade behaviors (since timeout would be fired, and the cluster would move into recovery mode).With us debugging just a single node in the cluster, the rest of the cluster just thought it was slow, it didn&#x2019;t have any impact, but allow us to observe the behavior of the system very easily. The solution was quite obvious once we got into that stage.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A few weeks ago I talked about how we can keep secrets on Linux. I wasn&#x2019;t really happy with the solution we came up with, namely a file that is ACLed so only the database user can access it, and I kept mulling that over in my head. We wanted something better, but we didn&#x2019;t want to start taking dependencies on technologies that the user might not have. What we came up with eventually was to externalize that decision. The only thing that we actually need is the single root key, so instead of keeping it on a file, we can let the admin provide a it for us (a script / executable / etc). What we&#x2019;ll do is we&#x2019;ll check if the user configured an executable to run, and if so, we&#x2019;ll run that exec, send it over STDIN the data, and read the result back over STDOUT.&#xA0; That free us from having to take dependencies and give the admin a great degree of freedom with how to deal with keeping secret in the way the organization is used to. After figuring this out, I found out that Apache is already doing something very similar with SSL Pass Phrase Dialog.</p>
