            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There seems to be some suspicion about the usage data from NH Prof that I published recently.  I would like to apologize for responding late to the comments, I know that there are some people who believe that I have installed a 3G chip directly to my head, but I actually was busy in the real world and didn&#x2019;t look at my email until recently. The blog runs on auto pilot just so I&#x2019;ll be able to do that, but sometimes it does give the wrong impression.  So, what does NH Prof &#x201C;phone home&#x201D; about?  Well, the data is actually divided into two distinct pieces. Most of the data (numbers, usages, geographic location, etc) actually comes from looking at the server logs for the update check.   Another piece of data that the profiler reports is feature usage. There are about 20 &#x2013; 30 individual features that are being tracked for usage. What does it means, tracking a feature?  Well, here are three examples that shows what gets reported:           There is no way to correlate this data to an individual user, nor is there a way to track the behavior of a single user.   I use this data mainly in order to see what features are being used most often (therefore deserving the most attention, optimizations, etc).  Those are mentioned in the product documentation.   To summarize:     I am not stealing your connection strings.    I don&#x2019;t gather any personally identifying data (and I am at somewhat at a loss to understand what I would do with it even if I did).    There is never any data about what you are profiling being sent anywhere.   I hope this clear things out.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I get asked that quite frequently. More to the point, how to become an international speaker?  I was recently at a gathering where no less than three different people asked me this question, so I thought that it might be a good post.     Note: this post isn&#x2019;t meant for someone who isn&#x2019;t already speaking. And if you are speaking but are bad at it, this isn&#x2019;t for you. The underlying assumption here is that you can speak and are reasonably good at it.    Note II: For this post, speaking is used to refer to presenting some technical content in front of an audience.    Why would you want to be a speaker anyway?  I heard that it is actually possible to make a living as a speaker. I haven&#x2019;t found it to be the case, but then again, while I speak frequently, I don&#x2019;t speak that frequently.   There are several reasons to want to be a speaker:     reputation (and in the end, good reputation means you get to raise your rates, get more work, etc).    contacts (speaking put you in front of dozens or hundreds of people, and afterward you get to talk with the people who are most interested in what you talked about)    advertising for your product (all those &#x201C;lap around Visual Studio 2010&#x201D; are actually an hour long ad that you paid to see :-) ).   I&#x2019;ll focus on the first two, reputation &amp; contacts gives you a much wider pool of potential work that you can choose from, increase the money you can make, etc.  So how do I do that, damn it?  Honestly, I have no idea. The first time that I presented at a technical conference, it was due to a mixup in communication. Apparently when in the US &#x201C;it would have been delightful&#x201D; means &#x201C;we regret to inform&#x201D;, but in Israel we read that as &#x201C;great, let us do it&#x201D;, and put the guy on the spot, so he had to scramble and do something.  Okay, I lied, I do have some idea about how to do this.  Again, I am assuming you are a reasonably good speaker (for myself, I know that my accent is a big problem when speaking English), but there are a lot of reasonably good speakers out there.  So, what is the answer? Make yourself different.  Pick a topic that is near &amp; dear to your heart (or to your purse, which also works) and prepare a few talks on it. Write about it in a blog, comment on other people blogs about the topic. Your goal should be that when people think about topic X, your name would be on that list.&#xA0; Forums like Stack Overflow can help, writing articles (whatever it is for pay or in places like CodeProject). Join a mailing list and be active there (and helpful). Don&#x2019;t focus on regionally associated forums / mailing list, though. The goal is international acknowledgement.   This will take at least a year, probably, for people to start recognizing your name (it took over 2 years for me). If it is possible, produce a set of tools that relate to your topic. Publish them for free, and write it off as an investment in your future.   For myself, NHibernate Query Analyzer would a huge boost in terms of getting recognized. And Rhino Mocks was probably what clinched the deal. I honestly have no idea how much time &amp; effort I put into Rhino Mocks, but Ohloh estimate that project at $ 12,502,089(!). While I disagree about that number, I did put a lot of effort into it, but it paid itself off several times over.  If you don&#x2019;t have a blog, get one. Don&#x2019;t get one at a community site, either. Community sites like blogs.microsoft.co.il are good to get your stuff read, but they have a big weakness in terms of branding yourself. You don&#x2019;t want to get lost in a crowd, you want people to notice who you are. And most people are going to read your posts in a feed reader, and they are going to notice that the community feed is interesting, not that you are interesting.  Post regularly. I try to have a daily post, but that would probably not be possible for you, try to post at least once a week, and try to time it so it is always on the same date &amp; time. Monday&#x2019;s midnight usually works.  Okay, I did all of that, what now?  Another note, this is something that you may want to do in parallel to the other efforts.  Unless you become very well known, you won&#x2019;t be approached, you&#x2019;ll have to submit session suggestions. Keep an eye on the conferences that interest you, and wait until they have a call for sessions. Submit your stuff. Don&#x2019;t get offended if they reject you.  If you live in a place that host international conferences (which usually rule Israel out), a good bet is to try to get accepted as a speaker there. You would be considerably cheaper than bringing someone from out of town/country. And that also play a role. Usually, if you managed to get into a conference once, they&#x2019;ll be much more likely to have you again. They have your speaker eval, and unless you truly sucked (like going on stage and starting to speak in Hebrew at Denmark), and that gives them more confidence in bringing you a second time.  And that is about it for now.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was recently asked to contrast the business decisions related to the profiler and RavenDB. I thought that it would make an excellent post.  There are a lot of aspects to thing about here, actually. The profiler is an add on tool, it is only useful if you are using one of the supported OR/Ms, but if you do&#x2026; it:     has very low barrier to entry, you need to reference the dll and add a single line of code.    provides immediate value, you can see the benefits that it gives you.    have very few moving parts that users can break.   NH Prof was released on Jan 1st, 2009. The first sale happened on Jan 2nd, 2009 (thanks Yann!).   The lead time for the profiler tends to be very short. Because there is very little that you need to invest and there is a lot that you gain. Yesterday I introduced a guy to the profiler as a way to help him see what his app is doing, he made a purchase about an hour later.  That is excellent news from my point of view. :-)  RavenDB, on the other hand:     has a very high barrier to entry, not so much from technical perspective, but from adoption one.    requires you to make significant changes to the way you work.    takes time to show why it is beneficial.    requires payment only when you actually goes live.    requires much higher degree of support for users.   That means that while it takes a few minutes to decide if you want the profiler (and the rest of the 30 days trial is spent getting corporate approving it :-) ), for RavenDB the lead time until you pull out your credit card is much longer.  That has some interesting implications. I actually spent a lot more (time &amp; money) in the profiler than I spent (outright) on RavenDB. But the major difference is what type of investment that would be.  There is a term in economics called sunk cost, that is all the costs associated with building a product up to the point you released it. That is money already spent. But what usually matter a lot more is that once you reached the release point, can the cash flow from a product justify the continued work on the product ( and maybe, at some point, pay for the product development) ?  NH Prof was a big investment for me, but money started coming in shortly afterward, and it became apparent that it was sustainable product. For RavenDB, the costs have actually been a lot lower (since the majority of them represented my own time), but the expectation is that it would take about a year or two before it would be be possible to say if RavenDB is a sustainable product.  In that sense, RavenDB represent a lot riskier investment. If RavenDB wasn&#x2019;t rattling in my head for so long, I would have probably would have gone to something with much shorter lead time.  It is interesting to me to see how many factors there are in those sort of decisions.&#xA0; So many things to balance.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;ll be speaking in JAOO 2010, giving an Introduction to RavenDB in the NoSQL track. This is going to be the first time that I am going to show RavenDB in a major conference, and I am just a tiny bit nervous. This is going to be interesting, because I am going to present to people who are experienced in NoSQL solutions.  In addition to my talk (obviously the highlight of the entire conference :-) ), there are other sessions that I really want to be at:          Rx: curing your asynchronous programming blues - Erik Meijer. This is something that have been popping into my sights for a while, but never long enough to sit down and really study it. So I think I&#x2019;ll take a shortcut through this session :-)            Lessons Learned in Large HTTP-Centric Systems &#x2013; Jim Webber. There are two reasons to go to one of Jim&#x2019;s talks. The first is the content, the second is the actual presentation style. Take a look at some of his talks to see what I means.            Building a Pet Store that will Survive Cyber - Cameron Purdy. This presentation interests me mostly because I don&#x2019;t believe that what is suggest can be delivered (virtually unlimited scaling in a generic fashion), so it would be very interesting to see what is going on there.            Where to put data - Michael T. Nygard. I usually learn new things from Michael, so I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing what he has to say about this.            And the conference gods have actually managed to set things up so I&#x2019;ll be able to be in all of those sessions, and not be busy giving a parallel session.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This seems like a minor thing, but it was raised during the design phase of SilverQueues/AgQueues/LuminQ (can someone spot the jokes?).   How does a client identify itself to the server? Consider the fact that there are likely to be clients popping up all the time, so we can&#x2019;t pre-assign them with meaningful names. The suggestion was brought up to use GUIDs to identify the client. That has the benefit of simplicity. It is easy to write, easy to implement and easy to understand from a conceptual level.  It got shot it down quickly, because while it is easy, I have never met the GUID that I could honestly say I have seen before. Recognizing clients by GUIDs is going to make it much harder to work with the system, however, because GUIDs are so opaque.   Instead of doing that, we will probably go with &#x201C;clients/329392&#x201D; or something similar, because that one is human readable. In the end, if you can make it easier to work with, it pays off, big time.</p>
