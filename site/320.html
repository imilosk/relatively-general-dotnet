            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post I talked about the journal and how it is used to recover the database state in case of errors. In other words, we write everything that we are going to do into the journal, and the code is written to run through the journal and apply these changes to the database. Ponder this for a moment, and consider the implications of applying the same concept elsewhere. Log shipping is basically taking the journal file from one server and asking another server to apply it as well. That is all. Everything else are mere details that aren&#x2019;t really interesting&#x2026; Well, they are, but first you need to grasp what is so special in log shipping. If you already have a journal and a recovery from it, you are probably at least 80% or so of the way there to getting log shipping to work. Now that you understand what log shipping is, let&#x2019;s talk about its implications. Depending on the way your log is structured, you might be able to accept logs from multiple servers and apply all of them (accepting the fact that they might conflict), but in practice this is almost never done in this manner. Log shipping typically mandates that one server would be designated the master (statically or dynamically), and the other(s) are designated as secondary (typically read only copies). The process in which the logs are shipped is interesting. You can do that on a time basis (every 5 &#x2013; 15 minutes), every time that you close a journal file (64MB &#x2013; 256MB), etc. This is typically called offline log shipping, because there is a large gap between the master and the secondary. There is also online log shipping, in which every write to the journal is also a socket write to the other server, which accepts the new journal entries, write them to its own journal and applies them immediately, resulting in a much narrower delay between the systems.&#xA0; Note that this has its own issues, because this is now a distributed system with all that it implies (if the secondary isn&#x2019;t available for an hour, what does it mean, etc.). But journals also allow us to do other fun stuff. In particular, if the journal file records the timestamp of transactions (and most do), they allow us to do what is called &#x201C;point in time&#x201D; recovery. Starting from a particular backup, apply all the committed transactions until a certain point in time, bring up to the state of the database at 9:07 AM (one minute before someone run an UPDATE statement without the WHERE clause). Note that all of the code that actually implements this has already been written as part of ensuring that the database can recover from errors, and all we need to implement &#x201C;point in time&#x201D; recovery is to just stop at a particular point in time. That is a pretty neat thing, in my opinion.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I talk a lot about journals, and how to make sure they are durable and safe. What I haven&#x2019;t talked about is what you put in the journal. Carsten reminded me of this lack, and I want to thank him for that. The first thing we need to understand is what the journal is supposed to do. The whole point of the journal is to make sure that you if you had some sort of error (including power loss), you can use the information on the journal to recover up to the same point you were at before the failure. More formally, in order to maintain ACID, we need to ensure that any transactions we committed (so clients rely on that) are there, and any ongoing transactions have been rolled back properly. The journal is the key to that, but how? A lot of this depends on the database engine itself, and that has an impact on the file format you used in the journal. The way you work with the journal has also a lot to do with the internals of the database. Let us take a relational database as an example. We want to insert a new row to a table. The size of the row is usually pretty small, a few dozen to a few hundred bytes. So it&#x2019;s cool, but how does it play into the journal? Well, before the database can actually modify the data, it needs to write its intent to do so in the journal, and flush it. Only then can it proceed, knowing that there is a stable record in the case of an error. One way of doing this is to write the following this record into the journal file:  { position: 1234, value: [binary] } After it is flushed, we can go ahead and modify the file itself. If we crash, during recovery we&#x2019;ll see that we have this entry in the journal, and we&#x2019;ll write it again to the same place in the data file. Either this will be a no-op, because it was previously applied, or we&#x2019;ll re-apply the change. At any rate, as an external observer, the fact that the journal entry exists ensures that on recovery, the value will be the same. Hence, the fact the entry was written and flushed to the journal ensures that the transaction change was committed. So this is the high level overview. The devil is in the details. The simplest journal file just records binary data and position, so we can write it out to the data file on recovery. But while that works, it is limiting the database engine in what it can do. If you have multiple concurrent transactions all of which are generating entries to the log, you don&#x2019;t want to force them to be written to the journal only on transaction commit, you want them to be appended to the log and flushed (so you can amortize the cost), and you want to write them out immediately. But this means that you are writing uncommitted changes to the journal file. So each of your entry also has a transaction number, and your transaction commit is another entry in the journal that orders to apply all operations from that particular transaction. At this point, you usually have different actors inside the database engine. You have an actor that is responsible for writing to the journal file, and one is typically merging multiple entries from multiple concurrent transactions to allow the maximum level of performance. Consider the implications of the following journal actor implementation: &#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

However, there are a few things to notice here.  We keep a record of the hash (CRC, MD5, etc) of all the writes.  When we get a transaction commit entry, we write it to the disk, and then write the hash for all the entries that were written since the last transaction commit.  We flush to disk, ensuring that we are actually persisting on spinning rust.  We let the caller know the transaction has been safely journaled to disk.  This code has a lot of tiny implications that are not immediately obvious. For example, whenever we send a journal entry to be written, we don&#x2019;t need to wait for it, we can proceed immediately to the next change in the transaction. And because the writes are buffered, even the I/O on the journal actor is very cheap. However, when we send a commit transaction entry, we do a few more things. Writing the hash of the all the entries that were written since the last transaction allows us to verify that all entries that were written were written successfully. If there was a power failure while we were writing the transaction, we would know and realize that this transaction isn&#x2019;t committed, and that is where the log ends. And while I don&#x2019;t need to wait for the journal entry to be flushed to disk, I do have to wait for the transaction itself to be written to disk before I let the user know that it has been committed. This type of structure also has the advantage of transactions sharing the load. If we have a long transaction that does something, its journal entries will be flushed to disk along with the other committing transactions. When we need to commit the long transaction, the amount of work we&#x2019;ll actually have to do is a lot less. The structure of the journal entry can range from the simple mode of writing what binary data to modify where, to actually have meaning for the database engine (SET [column id]=[value]). The latter is more complex, but it gives you more compact representation for journal entries, which means that you can pack more of them in the same space and I/O is at a premium. For the technical reasons mentioned in previous posts (alignment, performance, etc.), we typically write only on page boundaries (in multiples of 4KB), so we need to consider whether it is actually worth our time to write things now, or wait a bit and see if there is additional data coming that can complete the target boundary. What I described so far is one particular approach to handle that. It is used by databases such as PostgresSQL, Cassandra, etc. But it doesn&#x2019;t work quite in this manner. In the case of something like LevelDB, the journal is written one transaction at a time, under the lock, and in multiples of 32KB. The values in the journal are operations to perform (add / delete from the database), and that is pretty much it. It can afford to do that because all of its data files are immutable. PostgresSQL uses 8KB multiples and only stores in the journal only the data it needs to re-apply the transaction. This is probably because of the MVCC structure it has. SQL Server, on the other hand, stores both redo and undo information. It make sense, if you look at the journal actor above. Whenever we write an entry to the journal file, we don&#x2019;t yet know if the transaction would be committed. So we store the information we need to redo it (if committed) and undo it (if it didn&#x2019;t). Recovery is a bit more complex, and you can read about it the algorithm used most frequently (at least as the base) here: ARIES. With Voron, however, we choose to go another way. Each transaction is going to keep track of all the pages it modified. And when the transaction commits, we take all of those pages and compress them (to reduce the amount of I/O we have to do), compute a hash of the compressed data, and write it on 4KB boundary. Recovery then becomes trivial. Run through the journal file, and verify each transaction hash at a time. Once this is done, we know that the transaction is valid, so we can decompress the dirty pages and write them directly to the data file. Instead of handling operations log, we handle full pages. This means we don&#x2019;t actually care what modifications run on that page, we just care about its state. It makes adding new facilities to Voron very simple, because there is a very strict layering throughout, changing the way we do something has no impact on the journaling / ACID layer.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We recently had to deal with a stress test that was failing (very) occasionally. We looked into that, and we figured out that this was actually exposing a high severity bug. So we looked into it pretty seriously. And we keep hitting a wall.  There are a few reasons why you would have a non-reproducible error. The most common issue is if you have a race. For example, if two threads are modifying the same variable without proper synchronization, this will cause those kind of symptoms. We have a lot of experience in dealing with that, and all the signs were there. But we still hit a wall. You see, the problem was that the entire section of the code we were looking at was protected by a lock. There was no possibility of an error because of threading, since this whole part of the code just couldn&#x2019;t run concurrently anyway.  So why was it failing only occasionally? If it is single threaded, it should be predictable. In fact, the reason there was a lock there, instead of the more complex merge operations we used to have, was specifically to support reproducibility. The other kind of issue that can create this sort is I/O (which has its own timing issues), but the error happened in a part of the code that was operating on internal data structures, so it wasn&#x2019;t that. Eventually we figured it out. This was a long background operation, and because we needed to have the lock in place, we had a piece of code similar to this: &#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

But this was exactly what introduced the variability in the test results, and that made it so random and annoying. Once we figured that this was the cause for the difference, all we had to do was write the proper log of operations, and execute it again. The rest was just finding out which of the 200,000 transactions executed actually caused the problem, mere detail work .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the nicest tools that you have as a developer is the ability to debug. WinDBG isn&#x2019;t what I call the best debugger in the world, but it is certainly among the most powerful. This post is meant just to walk you through setting up WinDBG with a CoreCLR application. In particular, this is important when you are getting a crash dump from somewhere. In order to actually debug things properly, you need to load the crash dump into WinDBG and then run the following commands:  .sympath srv*c:\Symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols  .load C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\1.0.0\sos.dll .  .reload  The first step is to setup the symbols, so you can see method names, instead of addresses. The second will use the CoreCLR SOS dll (note, if you have different versions, you might need to get the sos.dll from the machine that the user is running along with the dump). And finally you are reloading the symbols (this will be slow on the first time). That is it, now you can start working with WinDBG relatively normally, although I did notice some some of the commands have better UI. Looks like SOS and SOSEX had a meeting .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The Uber Engineering group have posted a really great blog post about their move from Postgres to MySQL. I mean that quite literally, it is a pleasure to read, especially since they went into such details as the on-disk format and the implications of that on their performance. For fun, there is another great post from Uber, about moving from MySQL to Postgres, which also has interesting content.  Go ahead and read both, and we&#x2019;ll talk when you are done. I want to compare their discussion to what we have been doing. In general, Uber&#x2019;s issue fall into several broad categories:  Secondary indexes cost on write  Replication format  The page cache vs. buffer pool  Connection handling Secondary indexes Postgres maintain a secondary index that points directly to the data on disk, while MySQL has a secondary index that has another level of indirection. The images show the difference quite clearly:    Postgres MySQL     I have to admit that this is the first time that I ever considered the fact that the indirection&#x2019;s manner might have any advantage. In most scenarios, it will turn any scan on a secondary index into an O(N * logN) cost, and that can really hurt performance. With Voron, we have actually moved in 4.0 from keeping the primary key in the secondary index to keeping the on disk position, because the performance benefit was so high.  That said, a lot of the pain the Uber is feeling has to do with the way Postgres has implemented MVCC. Because they write new records all the time, they need to update all indexes, all the time, and after a while, they will need to do more work to remove the old version(s) of the record. In contrast, with Voron we don&#x2019;t need to move the record (unless its size changed), and all other indexes can remain unchanged. We do that by having a copy on write and a page translation table, so while we have multiple copies of the same record, they are all in the same &#x201C;place&#x201D;, logically, it is just the point of view that changes.  From my perspective, that was the simplest thing to implement, and we get to reap the benefit on multiple fronts because of this. Replication format Postgres send the WAL over the wire (simplified, but easier to explain) while MySQL send commands. When we had to choose how to implement over the wire replication with Voron, we also sent the WAL. It is simple to understand, extremely robust and we already had to write the code to do that. Doing replication using it also allows us to exercise this code routinely, instead of it only running during rare crash recovery.  However, sending the WAL has issues, because it modify the data on disk directly, and issue there can cause severe problems (data corruption, including taking down the whole database). It is also extremely sensitive to versioning issues, and it would be hard if not impossible to make sure that we can support multiple versions replicating to one another. It also means that any change to the on disk format needs to be considered with distributed versioning in mind. But what killed it for us was the fact that it is almost impossible to handle the scenario of replacing the master server automatically. In order to handle that, you need to be able to deterministically let the old server know that it is demoted and should accept no writes, and the new server that it can now accept writes and send its WAL onward. But if there is a period of time in which both can accept write, then you can&#x2019;t really merge the WAL, and trying to is going to be really hard.&#xA0; You can try using distributed consensus to run the WAL, but that is really expensive (about 400 writes / second in our benchmark, which is fine, but not great, and impose a high latency requirement). So it is better to have a replication format that is more resilient to concurrent divergent work.  OS Page Cache vs Buffer Pool From the post:  Postgres allows the kernel to automatically cache recently accessed disk data via the page cache. &#x2026; The problem with this design is that accessing data via the page cache is actually somewhat expensive compared to accessing RSS memory. To look up data from disk, the Postgres process issues lseek(2) and read(2) system calls to locate the data. Each of these system calls incurs a context switch, which is more expensive than accessing data from main memory. &#x2026; By comparison, the InnoDB storage engine implements its own LRU in something it calls the InnoDB buffer pool. This is logically similar to the Linux page cache but implemented in userspace. While significantly more complicated than Postgres&#x2019;s design&#x2026; So Postgres is relying on the OS Page Cache, while InnoDB implements its own. But the problem isn&#x2019;t with relying on the OS Page Cache, the problem is how you rely on it. And the way Postgres is doing that is by issuing (quite a lot, it seems) system calls to read the memory. And yes, that would be expensive. On the other hand, InnoDB needs to do the same work as the OS, with less information, and quite a bit of complex code, but it means that it doesn&#x2019;t need to do so many system calls, and can be faster.  Voron, on the gripping hand, relies on the OS Page Cache to do the heavy lifting, but generally issues very few system calls. That is because Voron memory map the data, so access it is usually a matter of just pointer dereference, the OS Page Cache make sure that the relevant data is in memory and everyone is happy. In fact, because we memory map the data, we don&#x2019;t have to manage buffers for the system calls, or to do data copies, we can just serve the data directly. This ends up being the cheapest option by far. Connection handling Spawning a process per connection is something that I haven&#x2019;t really seen since the CGI days. It seems pretty harsh to me, but it is probably nice to be able to kill a connection with a kill &#x2013;9, I guess. Thread per connection is also something that you don&#x2019;t generally see. The common situation today, and what we do with RavenDB, is to have a pool of threads that all manage multiple connections at the same time, often interleaving execution of different connections using async/await on the same thread for better performance.</p>
