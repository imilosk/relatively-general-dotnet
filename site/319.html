            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As I mentioned, given a 45 GB file containing all the StackOverflow questions since 2008, I wanted to transform items like this:  Into this:  This turn out to be rather tricky to do. The file is sorted by the row id, but there are tricks here:  You can&#x2019;t assume that all the answers to a question are located near the question itself. Ideally, we could keep a dictionary of the questions and their answers until we have all the answers to the question, they write it all out. The problem here is that a question might have answered years after it was asked, which means that the answer id would place it very far from the question in the file, which means that we have to keep the question in memory for a very long time. In practice, this happens quite frequently, and it plays havoc with trying to limit the memory utilization for this approach.  While you would expect that answers will always have a row id that is higher than their questions, that isn&#x2019;t always the case. Let us take this question, about Haskell monads, which has the following answer. The answer id is: 2388 The question id is: 44965 That means that if you scan the file sequentially, you are going to find the answers before their questions, somethings a lot before (I&#x2019;m guessing that this happens if you have edits to a question, so a popular question might get edited long after it was asked &amp; had answers). The next thing I tried was to group all the questions together, then process them. Because I can&#x2019;t do that in memory, I tried writing them to disk directly:  /questions/44965/q  /questions/44965/2388 The idea is that I can write them out to the file system, and then traverse the file system to gather all of them. The problem is that we are talking about over 32 million questions &amp; answers, that isn&#x2019;t really going to work for us using most normal file systems. So I tried writing it all to a zip file, which was successful, but resulted in a zip file that was 21GB in size, and was very good in ensuring that nothing could open it before I run out of patience.  Eventually I just gave us and used Voron to handle it, here are the relevant sections:  Remember that Voron stores everything in a B&#x2B;Tree, and allows to do ordered operations, so once this is done, all I need to do is traverse the tree, get all the records that have the same parent id, and voila, I have the grouping I wanted.  If I wanted to do it without the use of a database (or Voron), I would probably go with the following manner:  Read each entry from the source data, and write it to another file, noting its location. Write &#x201C;parent id, id, location&#x201D; to a separate index file Sort the index file. Start reading from the index file as long as I have the same parent id, and merge those questions. Why separate file? Because XmlReader does buffering, so it will be really hard to just in the file from just reading, by writing it out, we have the proper position to seek to. Note that this will require a lot of random I/O, but that is pretty much just what it has to be.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We are doing perf testing right now, and we are looking into real world datasets to play around with. Luckily for us, Stackoverflow have regular data dump of size significant enough to be useful for our experiments. The file that I&#x2019;m currently looking it is the Posts.xml file, which is about 45GB in size, and looks roughly like this (lot of stuff removed to make the point).  Since Stackoverflow is using relational database, their output is also relational. You can see that each element is a single row, and you have the ParentId in row #7 that points back to row #4. Basically, row #4 is the question, and row #7 is one of the answers.  What I want it to take all of this data and move it into a more document format. In other words, what I want to have all the answers for a question contained within the question, something like this:  The fun part here is that this is a pretty big file, and we are writing the output into a GzipStream, so we don&#x2019;t really have the option of saving / modifying midway through. Once we have written something out to the GzipStream, it cannot be changed. So we need to find a way in which we can group all the answers under their questions, but at the same time, the file size is big, much bigger than the memory I have available, so we can&#x2019;t just keep it all in memory and write it out in the end. How would you solve this issue? My attempt is currently sitting at roughly 10GB of RAM used after processing about 30GB of XML, but I have to admit that I have thrown it together rather quickly, since I just needed the data and a quick &amp; dirty solution is just fine here.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We spent some time recently looking into a lot of our old design decisions. Some of them make very little sense today (json vs. blittalbe as a good example), but made perfect sense at the time, and were essential to actually getting the product out. Some of those design decisions, however, are still something that I very firmly believe in.&#xA0; This series of posts is going to explore those decisions, their background and how they played out in the real world. So, without further ado, let us talk about unbounded result sets. The design of RavenDB was heavily influenced by my experience as That NHibernate Guy (I got started with NHibernate over a decade ago, if you can believe that), where I saw the same types of error, repeated over and over again. I then read Release It!, and I suddenly discovered that I wasn&#x2019;t alone fighting those kind of demons. When I designed RavenDB, I set out explicitly to prevent as many of those as I possibly could. One of the major issues that I wanted to address was Unbounded Result Sets, simply put, this is when you have:  SELECT * FROM OrderLines WHERE OrderID = 1555 And you don&#x2019;t realize that this order has three million line items (or, which is worst, that most of your orders have a few thousands line items, so you are generating a lot of load on the database, only to throw most of them away). In order to prevent this type of issue, RavenDB has the notion of mandatory page sizes.  On the client side, if you don&#x2019;t specify a limit, we&#x2019;ll implicitly add one (by default set to 128). On the server side, there is a database wide maximum page size (by default set to 1024). The server will trim all page sizes to the max if they are larger. I think that this is one of the more controversial decisions in RavenDB design, and one that got a lot of heated discussion. But I still think that this is a good idea,because I have seen what happens when you don&#x2019;t do that.&#xA0;&#xA0; And the arguments are mostly about &#x201C;RavenDB should trust developers to know what they are doing&#x201D; and a particular irate guy called me while I was out shopping to complain how I broke the sacred contract of Linq with regards to &#x201C;queries should return all by default, even if this is ten billion results&#x201D;. I pointed out that this is actually configurable, and if he wanted to set the default to any size he wanted, he could do that, but apparently it is supposed to be &#x201C;shoot my own foot first, then think&#x201D; kind of deal. Even though that I still think that this is a really good idea, we have added some features over the years to make it easy for people to access the entire dataset when they need it. Streaming has been around since 2.5 or so, giving you a dedicated API to stream unbounded results. Streams were built to make it efficient to process large sets of data, and they allow both client &amp; server to process the data in parallel, instead of batching huge responses on the server, then consuming ridiculous amounts of memory on the client before giving you the full result set. Instead, you can get each result as soon as it arrive from server, and you can process it and send it further. In 4.0, we are going to change the behavior of the paging limits so:  If you don&#x2019;t specify a limit, we&#x2019;ll supply a limit clause of 25 items. If there are more than 25 items, we&#x2019;ll throw an exception (unless you asked otherwise in the conventions).  If you supply a limit explicitly, it will work as expected and page through the data. The idea is that we want to reduce the surprise for users, and that can give them the experience to draw upon early on. Another thing that we&#x2019;ll do is make sure that the operations guys can also change that, likely with an environment variable or something like that. If you need to modify the conventions on the fly, you usually have hard time deploying a new version, and an immediate action is needed. In this manner, we can help users avoid expensive requests to the server, and they can be explicit with what they need to do.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that we have learned from supporting RavenDB in production is that you by default, everything is a black box into which you have exactly zero input. And in order to figure out what the problems are, you need to use expert tools (WinDBG or VM MAP for example) that are typically more focused on developers, and not usually available in production. In RavenDB 4.0, we have started from the get go with the notion that everything we do must be exposed, tracked and monitored. Here is the results of the latest effort in that direction.  And:  There are several important things here. First, you can see that we are tracking the managed and unmanaged allocations that are happening in the system. More than that, we are now able to track down exactly which part of the system is responsible for that. In the screenshots above, you can see that the UsageIpAndQuantity index has allocated about 65 MB of unmanaged memory, and that we have a few memory mapped files storing the data for index #3. The idea is that we can now glance at this endpoint and tell very quickly what is going on. And this is something that can be done in production. In fact, that is something that we&#x2019;ll expose in the studio so you can see those value change over time. We are also waiting for the CoreCLR to expose the managed allocations on&#xA0; a per thread basis, which will give us even better metrics.</p>
