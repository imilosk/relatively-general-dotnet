            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I like reading, specifically, science fiction and fantasy has always had a huge pull on my imagination. That let me to a great series of books by Ilona Andrews, the latest of which has just come out.  I live in Israel, and shipping time &amp; cost from the US is quite prohibitive. At times, I have paid four or five times the cost of the book just to be able to get the bloody thing. So the rise of the Kindle filled me with a great sense of relief. I got a Kindle and started reading on that (I love it). I estimate that I read over 200 books on the thing already.  One thing that I really like is the ability to pre order a book, get it on my Kindle when it is out, and start reading immediately. But recently I have gotten several notifications about books that I really wanted to read. Here is one:     We&#x27;re writing to let you know that we&#x27;ve canceled your order for Magic Bleeds because it will not be released by the publisher in Kindle format on&#xA0; Tuesday, May 25, 2071 as previously expected. We don&#x27;t yet have a date for when this item will be released for Kindle. We will send you an email notifying you when the Kindle edition becomes available.   Okay, annoying. Let us hit audible.com and see if they have the audio book version available. It appears that this is not the case&#x2026; but I can buy the CD version, which requires physical shipping, from Amazon.  Where does it leaves me?   There seems to be no way for me to get the book in a reasonable timeframe/cost.   Wait, let me rephrase that. There appears to be no legal way. While I have no direct knowledge of that, I am guessing that if I hit a torrent site and try to search for the book, I would not only find the book, but will be able to get the freaking thing faster than going with the legal download route.  It is actually quite simple. I would really like to give you some money, if you make it harder for me to give you money, you won&#x2019;t get my money.  This decision is stupid, moronic, idiotic, senseless, irritating, annoying and in general lack all sense.   ~Ayende the annoyed</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The ShoppingCart class in the MVC Music Store is my current punching bug, I really don&#x2019;t like it.  You can see how it looks on the image on the right. The problem is that this code mixes two different responsibilities:     Operations about a shopping cart:              GetCart         GetCartId         GetCartItems         GetCount             Operations of a shopping cart:              AddToCart         CreateOrder         EmptyCart         MigrateCart         RemoveFromCart            You might have noticed that all the operations about a shopping cart are get operations. All the operations of the cart are things that belong to the cart, it is the cart&#x2019;s business logic and reason for being. The Get operations don&#x2019;t belong to the cart, they belong in some other object that manages instances of carts.  In most applications, we would call this object a Repository. I am not sure that we really need one here. Looking at the Get methods, most of them are here because of the decision to only store cart line items, which requires us to issue explicit queries to get the data.  With Raven, we would follow a different model, which means that the only thing we are likely to need is GetCart() and maybe GetCartId().   Here is how a typical cart document will look like as a document:    And as an entity in our application:    &#xA0;     The GetTotal method was replaced with a Total property.&#xA0; Until the GetTotal method, with issued a query to the database, this property operates solely in memory. This is another major difference with Raven vs. OR/M solution is that Raven doesn&#x2019;t do lazy loading. This is by design, since document dbs data models rarely need to traverse data outside their own document. Traversing the document from Raven cannot force lazy loading or result in the dreaded SELECT N&#x2B;1 issues.   And now let us deal with the operations about a cart. The most important ones are GetCartId and GetCart. I think that those methods has no place there. I created a new class, ShoppingCartFinder, which looks like this:     Note that we don&#x2019;t expose GetCartId anymore, this is an internal detail that shouldn&#x2019;t be seen by clients of this class. We do need to support setting the cart id, because we also support cart migrations (when an anonymous users logs in). We don&#x2019;t need any of the other methods, so I removed them.  Let us go over the operations of the cart.       The method on the left is the original code, and on the right you can see Raven&#x2019;s code. The Raven code operates completely in memory, and in totally persistence ignorance. The old code is deals explicitly with persistence. This isn&#x2019;t that much of a problem, except that this is the wrong level to deal with persistence issues.      &#xA0;  Going over RemoveFromCart, you can see that it shrunk significantly in size, and again, it is an in memory operation only. EmptyCart isn&#x2019;t implemented in the Raven version, since it is just a Lines.Clear()  It is interesting to note that EmptyCart in the old implementation would result in N queries, where N is the number of items in the cart, while with Raven, this will result in 1 query.                I don&#x2019;t think that there is much to say here, except that the old code would execute N*2 queries, while Raven&#x2019;s code will still execute 1 query :-)  MigrateCart is interesting, because the implementation is drastically different:      With the old code, we update all the items in the cart, one at a time. With Raven, we do something drastically different. The Shopping Cart Id is the document key, so given the shopping cart id (which is the user name or stored in the session), we can load the shopping cart in using a Load (by primary key, to equate to the relational mindset). Migrating a cart is a simple enough operation, all you have to do is change the key. Since Raven doesn&#x2019;t allow renames, we do it with a Delete/Store, which are executed inside a single transaction.  The calling code for MigrateCart looks like this:  &#xA0;  Note that SaveChanges is atomic and transactional, so this has the same effect as issuing a rename.  And that is it for the shopping cart, in my next post, I&#x2019;ll discuss the ShoppingCartController which uses this class.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post is copied (with permission) from Roy Osherove. I don&#x2019;t often do things like that but Roy&#x2019;s post has pushed a lot of red buttons.  Let me just hand you over to Roy:     A month or so ago, Microsoft Israel started sending out emails to its partners and registered event users to &#x201C;Save the date!&#x201D; &#x2013; Micraoft Teched Israel is coming, and it&#x2019;s going to be this november!    &#x201C;Great news&#x201D; I thought to myself. I&#x2019;d been to a couple of the MS teched events, as a speaker and as an attendee, and it was lovely and professionally done. Israel is an amazing place for technology and development and TechEd hosted some big names in the world of MS software.    A couple of weeks ago, I was shocked to hear from a couple of people that Microsoft Israel plans to only accept non-MS teched speakers, only from sponsors of the event. That means that according to the amount that you have paid, you get to insert one or more of your own selected speakers as part of teched.    I&#x2019;ve spent the past couple of weeks trying to gather more evidence of this, and have gotten some input from within MS about this information. It looks like that is indeed the case, though no MS rep. was prepared to answer any email I had publicly. If they approach me now I&#x2019;d be happy to print their response.    What does this mean?    If this is true, it means that Microsoft Israel is making a grave mistake &#x2013;         They are diluting the quality of the speakers for pure money factors. That means, that as a teched attendee, who paid good money, you might be sitting down to watch nothing more that a bunch of infomercials, or sub-standard speakers &#x2013; since speakers are no longer selected on quality or interest in their topic.       They are turning the conference from a learning event to a commercial driven event       They are closing off the stage to the community of speakers who may not be associated with any organization&#xA0; willing to be a sponsor       They are losing speakers (such as myself) who will not want to be part of such an event. (yes &#x2013; even if my company ends up sponsoring the event, I will not take part in it, Sorry Eli!)       They are saying &#x201C;F&amp;$K you&#x201D; to the community of MVPs who should be the people to be approached first about technical talks (my guess is many MVPs wouldn&#x2019;t want to talk at an event driven that way anyway )       I do hope this ends up not being true, but it looks like it is. MS Israel had already done such a thing with the Developer Days event previouly held in Israel &#x2013; only sponsors were allowed to insert speakers into the event.    If this turns out to be true I would urge the MS community in Israel to NOT TAKE PART AT THIS EVENT in any form (attendee, speaker, sponsor or otherwise). by taking part, you will be telling MS Israel it&#x2019;s OK to piss all over the community that they are quietly suffocating anyway.    The MVP case    MS Israel has managed to screw the MVP program as well. MS MVPs (I&#x2019;m one) have had a tough time here in Israel the past couple of years. ever since yosi taguri left the blue badge ranks, there was not real community leader left. Whoever runs things right now has their eyes and minds set elsewhere, with the software MVP community far from mind and heart. No special MVP events (except a couple of small ones this year). No real MVP leadership happens here, with the MVP MEA lead (Ruari) being on a remote line, is not really what&#x2019;s needed.    &#x201C;MVP? What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D; I&#x2019;m sure many MS Israel employees would say. Exactly my point.    Last word    I&#x2019;ve been disappointed by the MS machine for a while now, but their slowness to realize what real community means in the past couple of years really turns me off. Maybe it&#x2019;s time to move on. Maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t be chasing people at MS Israel begging for a room to host the Agile Israel user group. Maybe it&#x2019;s time to say a big bye bye and start looking at a life a bit more disconnected from that giant. I hear the people at Google are pretty Agile!   And now back to me. I had more discussions in the last two years with Microsoft UK than with Microsoft Israel. I think it says it all, and I am an Israeli MVP who spends most of his time in Israel.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We will start with the Index() method:     There are one this in this code that bothers me, and that is that this code is going to perform two DB queries. But that is beside the point, since we are going to modify the whole thing.  And here is my port:     As you can see, it is pretty much the same, and not really that interesting. Let us see what else we have:     Something that is important to note here is that we are doing a search on the name of a genre. The problem is that the genre name isn&#x2019;t the primary key, worse, there isn&#x2019;t even an index on the name column. Now, admittedly, the genre table contains ten rows, but it is the principal of the thing. (If you are smart, you only have to be read the riot act by the DBA about non index queries in production once).  Now, it would be trivial for us to implement this in Raven using the same approach, but I don&#x2019;t see a reason to do this. The genre that we get in the Browse method is dependant on the data that we return from the Index method, so there is no reason no to pass the id of the genre directly. I modified the Index() action to pass the entire genre, not just the genre name, and to pass the id back to the Browse() action, not the name.   I gotten started implementing this, but I got stuck on the association of Albums from the genre.      Document database doesn&#x2019;t normally have associations, and they don&#x2019;t have joins. So how can we do this?  By now, you should be pretty familiar with the answer, we need to define an index :-)     // AlbumsByGenre&#xA;from album in docs.Albums&#xA;where album.Genre != null&#xA;select new { Genre = album.Genre.Id }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And this index allows us to write this code:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;And finally, we have the GenreMenu:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Which we can port very easily: &#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And that is all for the StoreController</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am ashamed to say how much time and effort (and at least one complete re-design) this bug has cost me.  Take a look at the following test, meant to show that Raven can replicate deletes between servers:     There is a very subtle bug in this code, which completely tripped me.   Here is a hint, the session interface is the high level client API for Raven.   Can you spot the bug?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">On my last post, I mention that we need to add a CountSold property to all the albums, in most SQL system, something like that can be pretty painful. The syntax for adding a new column is easy, but actually getting it done, and deployed, and versioned, is pretty hard. With Raven, if you add a new property, it will automatically be added to your document when you next save it. There is no action required on your part. The same, by the way, would happen when you remove a property. Raven will clean it up after you.  The question is what happens when we want to set that value to something, not just to the default value? We need to provide that logic somehow, and here is a simple way of doing so;     using (var documentStore = new DocumentStore { Url = &quot;http://localhost:8080&quot; })&#xA;{&#xA;    documentStore.Initialise();&#xA;    using (var session = documentStore.OpenSession())&#xA;    {&#xA;        IDictionary&lt;string,int&gt; albumToSoldCount = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();&#xA;        int count = 0;&#xA;&#xA;        do&#xA;        {&#xA;            var results = session.Query&lt;SoldAlbum&gt;(&quot;SoldAlbums&quot;)&#xA;                .Take(128)&#xA;                .Skip(count)&#xA;                .ToArray();&#xA;&#xA;            if (results.Length == 0)&#xA;                break;&#xA;            count &#x2B;= results.Length;&#xA;            foreach (var soldAlbum in results)&#xA;            {&#xA;                albumToSoldCount[soldAlbum.Album] = soldAlbum.Quantity;&#xA;            }&#xA;        } while (true);&#xA;&#xA;        count = 0;&#xA;        do&#xA;        {&#xA;            var albums = session.Query&lt;Album&gt;()&#xA;                .Skip(count)&#xA;                .Take(128)&#xA;                .ToArray();&#xA;            if (albums.Length == 0)&#xA;                break;&#xA;&#xA;            foreach (var album in albums)&#xA;            {&#xA;                int value;&#xA;                albumToSoldCount.TryGetValue(album.Id, out value);&#xA;&#xA;                album.CountSold = value;&#xA;            }&#xA;&#xA;            count &#x2B;= albums.Length;&#xA;&#xA;            session.SaveChanges();&#xA;            session.Clear();&#xA;        } while (true);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;To those of you who haven&#x2019;t bother to read the code, this is reading the index that we previously created and remembering its value. Then we start reading batches of albums and update their counts. All in all, it is quite simple.&#xA;&#xA;An additional nice property of this script is that you can run it is safe to run it multiple times.</p>
