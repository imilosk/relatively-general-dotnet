            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a new feature available for NHibernate Profiler*, Linq to SQL Profiler and Entity Profiler. Basically, it detects when the same query is executed with different parameter sizes, which generate different query plan in the query cache.  Let us say that we issue two queries, to find users by name. (Note that I am using a syntax that will show you the size of the parameters, to demonstrate the problem).  We can do this using the following queries.     exec sp_executesql &#xA;      N&#x27;SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @username&#x27;,&#xA;      N&#x27;@username nvarchar(3)&#x27;,&#xA;      @username=N&#x27;bob&#x27;&#xA;exec sp_executesql &#xA;      N&#x27;SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @username&#x27;,&#xA;      N&#x27;@username nvarchar(4)&#x27;,&#xA;      @username=N&#x27;john&#x27;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This sort of code result in two query plans stored in the database query cache, because of the different parameter sizes. In fact, if we assume that the Username column has a length of 16, this single query may take up 16 places in the query cache.&#xA;&#xA;Worse, if you have two parameters whose size change, such as username (length 16) and password (length 16), you may take up to 256 places in the query cache. Obviously, if you use more parameters, or if their length is higher, the number of places that a single query can take in the query cache goes up rapidly.&#xA;&#xA;This can cause performance problems as the database need to keep track of more query plans (uses more memory) may need evict query plans from the cache, which would result in having to rebuild the query plan (increase server load and query time).&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;* Please note that detecting this in NHibernate requires the trunk version of NHibernate. And it is pretty useless there, since on the trunk, NHibernate will never generate this issue.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I started thinking about all the type of stuff that I had to write or participated at, and I find it&#x2026; interesting.     Database &#x2013; Rhino.DivanDB (hobby project).    Data Access &#x2013; Multitude of those.    OR/M &#x2013; NHibernate, obviously, but a few others as well.    Distributed caching systems &#x2013; NMemcached &#x2013; several of those.    Distributed queuing systems &#x2013; Rhino Queues actually have ~7 different implementations.    Distributed hash table &#x2013; Rhino DHT is in production.    Persistent hash tables &#x2013; Rhino PHT, of course, but I actually had to write a different implementation for the profiler as well.    Mocking framework &#x2013; Rhino Mocks, obviously.    Web frameworks&#x2013; I am referring to MonoRail, although I only dabbled there, to be truthful. Rhino Igloo was a lot of fun, too, if only because I had to.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A recent change in the profiler has resulted in the following dialog showing up whenever you close the application on x64 Vista/Win7 machines.      Just to be clear, I am not using flash in any way, but something is triggering this check.  Basically, I think that somewhere a call like the one described here is made. Checking for the presence of flash, and that is what triggers the PCA dialog. That makes a sort of sense, mostly because we now shell out to IE to do some stuff for us (we use WPF&#x2019;s builtin WebBrowser control).  Now, the documentation for that says:     PCA is intended to detect issues with older programs and not intended to monitor programs developed for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. The best option to exclude a program from PCA is to include, with the program, an application manifest with run level (either Administrator or as limited users) marking for UAC. This marking means the program is tested to work under UAC (and Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008). PCA checks for this manifest and will exclude the program. This process applies for both installer and regular programs.   The problem, however, is that even after I included the $@#$(@# manifest, it is still showing the bloody dialog.  I find it quite annoying. Here is the custom manifest that comes with the profiler.     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;&#xA;&lt;assembly xmlns=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1&quot; manifestVersion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;v3:trustInfo xmlns:v3=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;v3:security&gt;&#xA;      &lt;v3:requestedPrivileges&gt;&#xA;        &lt;v3:requestedExecutionLevel level=&quot;asInvoker&quot; uiAccess=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/v3:requestedPrivileges&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/v3:security&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/v3:trustInfo&gt;&#xA;&lt;/assembly&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;As far as I can see, it should work.&#xA;&#xA;Any ideas?&#xA;&#xA;And twitter came to the rescue and told me that I need to specify that I am compatible on Win7, the current manifest, which fixes the issue, is:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;&#xA;&lt;assembly xmlns=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1&quot; manifestVersion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;v3:trustInfo xmlns:v3=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;v3:security&gt;&#xA;      &lt;v3:requestedPrivileges&gt;&#xA;        &lt;v3:requestedExecutionLevel level=&quot;asInvoker&quot; uiAccess=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/v3:requestedPrivileges&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/v3:security&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/v3:trustInfo&gt;&#xA;  &lt;compatibility xmlns=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:compatibility.v1&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;application&gt;&#xA;      &lt;!--The ID below indicates application support for Windows Vista --&gt;&#xA;      &lt;supportedOS Id=&quot;{e2011457-1546-43c5-a5fe-008deee3d3f0}&quot;/&gt;&#xA;      &lt;!--The ID below indicates application support for Windows 7 --&gt;&#xA;      &lt;supportedOS Id=&quot;{35138b9a-5d96-4fbd-8e2d-a2440225f93a}&quot;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/application&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/compatibility&gt;&#xA;&lt;/assembly&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I would like to Paul Betts for handing me the answer in less than 3 minutes.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run across the following quote a while ago, and I found it quite interesting.     &#x201C;As to the methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.&#x201D;      - Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)   I have been programming, in one form or another, for about fifteen years, but I can put my finger on the precise moment in which I moved from a mere dabbler to a professional. That was in 1999, and I decided that I had enough of toying with Pascal, VB6 &amp; Java Applets. It was the height of the bubble, and I wanted to learn just enough to be able to get a job doing something that I enjoyed. I had about a year opened to me, and I registered myself to a C/C&#x2B;&#x2B; course in a local college.  In hindsight, that was one of the best things that I have ever done. That course taught me C and pointers, and then C&#x2B;&#x2B; and OO. I also introduced me to concepts that I have been using ever since. Admittedly, I don&#x2019;t want to look at any of my code from that time period, but that is probably a good thing :-) The most important part of the course was that it taught me how computers work, by introducing C first and forcing me to write my own implementation of any system call that I wanted to make.   I studied programming in High School as well, and I distinctly remember being utterly and completely baffled by strange things like dynamic memory and pointers. I mean, why don&#x2019;t you just allocate a bigger array. During that course I actually grasped pointers for the first time, and even looking back over the last couple of weeks, a lot of my performance work recently is directly based on things that I learned there.  After completing that course, I got several books to help me understand the fundamentals better. Operating Systems Design and Implementation, Modern Operating Systems and Operating System Concepts to understand how an operating system works, not just a single program. Win32 System Programming, which I read mainly to understand the environment in which I was working and Windows Sockets Network Programming, from which I learned the basic concepts of networking.  The common thread throughout all of them is that initially I focused on understanding the technical environment in which I was working, getting to understand how things are working at a very low level. And while it may appear that understand those low level details would be nice in terms of general education but have little relevance to where I am spending most of my time, that is quite inaccurate. The recently built serialization system built for the profiler was heavily influenced from my reading of the OS books, for example.  For that matter, other good books are Practical File System Design, talking about the BeOS file system, which I found utterly fascinating or Virtual Machine Design and Implementation C/C&#x2B;&#x2B; which is a horrible book, but one that gave me the confidence to do a lot of things, since I saw how trivially simple it was to build such things.  Coming back to the quote in the beginning of this post, understanding the underlying principles has allowed me to do approach a new technology with the confidence that I understand how it must work, because I understand the environment in which it works. Oh, there are a lot of details that you need to get, but once you have the conceptual model of a technology in mind, it is so much easier to get to grips with it.  Interestingly enough, I only got to software design books at a much later stage, and even today, I find the low level details quite fascinating, when I can get new material in a subject that is interesting to me.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I spent some time today trying to optimize the amount of data the profiler is sending on the wire. My first thought was that I could simply wrap the output stream with a compressing stream and use that, indeed, in my initial testing, it proved to be quite simple to do and reduced the amount of data being sent by a factor of 5. I played around a bit more and discovered that different compression implementation can bring me up to a factor of 50!  Unfortunately, I did all my initial testing on files, and while the profiler is able to read files just fine, it is most commonly used for live profiling, to see what is going on in the application right now. The problem here is that adding compression is a truly marvelous way to screw that up. Basically, I want to compress live data, and most compression libraries are not up for that task. It gets a bit more complex when you realize that what I actually wanted was a way to get compression to work on relatively small data chunks.  When you think how most compression algorithm works (there is a dictionary in there somewhere), you realize what the problem is. You need to keep updating the dictionary while you are compressing the stream, and at the same time, you need the dictionary to uncompress things. That make it&#x2026; difficult to handle things. I thought about compressing small chunks (say, every 256Kb), but then I run into problems of figuring out when exactly I am supposed to be flushing them, how to handle partial messages, and more.  In the end, I decided that while it was a very interesting trial run, this is not something that is likely to show good ROI.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the more interesting points of my posts about Entity Framework &amp; NHibernate is the discovery of things that Entity Framework can do that NHibernate cannot. In fact, if you&#x2019;ll read the posts, instead of the comments, you can see that this is precisely what I asked, but people didn&#x2019;t really read the text.  I wanted to dedicate this post to ghost objects, and how NHibernate deals with them.  Before we start, let me explain what ghost objects are. Let us say that you have a many to one polymorphic association, such as the one represented as Comment.Post.  A post may be either a Post or an Article, and since NHibernate by default will lazy load the association, NHibernate will generate a proxy object (also called a ghost object). That, in turn, result in several common issues: Leaking this and the inability to cast to the proper type are the most common ones.  In practice, this is something that you would generally run into when you are violating the Liskov Substitution Principle, so my general recommendation is to just fix your design.  Nevertheless, since the question pop up occasionally, I thought that I might write a bit more details on how to resolve this. Basically, the main issue is that at the point in time where we are loading the Comment entity, we don&#x2019;t have enough information to know what the actual entity type is. The simplest way to work around this issue is to tell NHibernate to load the associated entity as part of the parent entity load.  In the case of the comment, we can do it like this:     &lt;many-to-one name=&quot;Post&quot; &#xA;             lazy=&quot;false&quot;&#xA;             outer-join=&quot;true&quot;&#xA;             column=&quot;PostId&quot;/&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;The lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D; tell NHibernate to load the association eagerly, while the outer-join will add a join to load it in a single query. One thing to note, however, is that (by design) HQL queries will ignore any hints in the mapping, so you would have to specify join fetch explicitly in the mapping, otherwise it would generate a separate query for that.&#xA;&#xA;Since we eagerly load the associated entity, and we know its type, we don&#x2019;t have to deal with any proxies, and can avoid the ghost objects problem completely.</p>
