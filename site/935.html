            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I noticed a couple of new trends in Spam lately, I got a top on stock quotes with &quot;insider information&quot; which I thought was cute, for the first time, that is. The other thing I recently got is something that I like to call Reverse Live Adress Verifying. Are you familiar with &quot;You send a mail to Bob, please click this link to verify you are a real person.&quot; type of mails?    I got one of those to someone I never send an email to in my life, and from an adress I don&#x27;t use. I tend to believe that cliking on the link would confirm the adress as a live one, which would boost it ranking.    Another annoying thing is spam to register in a new and exicting blog directory, which just mean that I&#x27;ll never go to that site. On general, I don&#x27;t have a problem with personal unsolicited email. I get quite a few help requests, in various subjects, and I like to help people, but as a hint, if you think of including me in a list of emails that I did not ask to join, that is going to piss me off, and the the mail is on its way to the trash bin, and most further emails would head this way authomatically.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here is a nice post&#xA0;by Jeff Atwood, with a really cool idea that I like. Using a free form address field instead of seperating the fields.    On the one hand, it&#x27;s easier for the user, since this is easy to grasp. On the other hand, we can&#x27;t you auto complete. Read the comments, they are interesting, and be sure to check the screen shot he has there.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, I&#x27;m going to take a break from tech content and talk about something completely else. I just had a really strange dream.    I&#x27;m standing in my old street, talking to my brother, and for some reason I carry a M-16 assult rifle. At this point I see two World War I planes, one red and one yellow, flying really low. The yellow one is smoking and sputtering, and crashes nearby very soon. I try to shoot down the red plane, but it is too far/too fast to hit. I get a really cool Matrix effect, though, since I can see the bullets speeding through the air. I may have pissed the pilot, since he crashes the plane on my house (which move aside to accomodate the plane). I rush to the plane and pull the clutch, at this point the whole plane falls apart.    I hear a scream of rage, and an old german colonel in brown-red&#xA0;rubber suit with a suit of armor try to charge me with a sword. I shot him, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt him. He does lose interest, though, and goes away. I spent a couple of minutes thinkning about the bullet absorving capabilities of a medival armor*, and the I woke up.    I&#x27;m writing this down because I tend to forget my dreams in a few hours, and this dream is an interesting one. Freud away.    * None.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Clemens has a post about O/R Mappers. From his post:             Another argument I keep hearing is that O/R mapping yields a significant productivity boost. However, if that were the case and if using O/R mapping would shorten the average development cost in a departmental development project by &#x2013; say &#x2013; a quarter or more, O/R mapping would likely have taken over the world by now. It hasn&#x27;t. And it&#x27;s not that the idea is new. It&#x2019;s been around for well more than a decade.         O/R Mappers are hard to do without framework services such as reflection. Code generation can support this for lagnauges without reflection, but this is harder to do, and much less flexible. I think that this is one of the reasons that ORM is only now getting a lot of notice from people (now being relative, Hibernate is very strong in the Java space, and has been for quite a while). I believe that the reason that ORM adoption is slow is simply because Microsoft&#x27;s stance in the matter was &quot;Using Stored Procedures and Result Sets (COM) / DataSets (.Net)&quot; for a long time, and now it is &quot;Wait for DLinq.&quot;     O/R Mappers certainly do not take the complexity away, I still need to be aware of it, but it doesn&#x27;t get shoved in my face every time that I need to do something that touches the database. Understanding what is happening in all layers is important in this, as in all other things. The major benefit of using O/R Mappers in your application comes when you realize how flexible you suddenly are. You need to make a query that you have not thought of before? Just ask the O/R to do it for you, there is no context switch while you add an additional method to your DAL, write the stored procedure, test them both, and then return to your code. Instead, you just tell the O/R mapper to give the data you want. This is very powerful, and it is a huge productivity enhancement.     Clemens goes on to say that we should treat our database as a service, and apply the following principals to it:                         Boundaries are explicit&#xA0;=&gt; Database access is explicit                             Services avoid coupling (autonomy)&#xA0;=&gt; Database schema and in-process data representation are disjoint and mapped explicitly                             Share schema not code&#xA0;=&gt; Query/Sproc result sets and Sproc inputs form data access schema (aliased result sets provide a degree of separation from phys. schema)                 I already have an explicit boundary.&#xA0;There is my code, and there is the O/R library. The O/R library expose a set of classes / methods that I can use to query the database. How they do it, I really don&#x27;t care about. It&#x27;s pretty clear when I&#x27;m accessing the database and when I&#x27;m not. The fact that I don&#x27;t have CustomersDAL or SqlConnection in sight doesn&#x27;t mean that the boundary is less real.     Coupling between the in process data representation and the database schema is not something I worry about. Why? Because my O/R of choice (NHibernate, in case you missed it) can handle pretty much every schema that I throws at it, and do it more quickly (and likely more efficently) than I can do it. I&#x27;m not tied to a particular schema, and I don&#x27;t care if my database is changed. All I need to do is update the mappings, and I&#x27;m done with it.     I&#x27;m not sure what is the difference between the second and third points is, since to me it seems like repeating the same statement, with different focus. I don&#x27;t care for seperation from the physical schema in the database layer because I&#x27;ve already go that seperation by using an O/R mapper. Every class of data items (table) surround special considerations: read-only, read/write, insert-only; update frequency, currency and replicability; access authorization; business relevance; caching strategies; etc.&#xA0;     Yes, indeed, I fully agree with Clemens on this one. But I just don&#x27;t see the relevance of this to the O/R vs Custom DAL argument. I can define all of that with ORM more easily than I could if I was writing my own DAL. Proper data management is the key to great architecture. Ignoring this and abstracting data access and data management away just to have a convenient programming model is &#x2026; problematic.     I sort of agree with this, and then I sort of don&#x27;t. What does Clemens suggest here? Write Stored Procedures and Custom DALs? For what purpose, exactly? The API that I&#x27;ll get from a well designed DAL is likely to be very similar to the API I get now (for much less work and effort) by using an ORM.     One thing that Clemens said that is likely to cause problems is: Many of the proponents of O/R mapping that I run into (and that is a generalization and I am not trying to offend anyone &#x2013; just an observation) are folks who don&#x27;t know SQL and RDBMS technology in any reasonable depth and/or often have no interest in doing so.     Well, I know SQL, and I think that I know it pretty well. I am not a guru by any means, but I can use the tools that SQL gives me to get the correct result back. I still love O/R Mapping, not because I have no interest in SQL or RDBMS, but because they are grunt work. I enjoy working with SQL to solve complex problems, and I can make SQL Server cry and beg for mercy, but doing this for everyday work? Why on earth would I want to do that? I don&#x27;t do memory management on my own anymore, and for much the same reasons. It&#x27;s boring, it&#x27;s easy to get wrong and it&#x27;s just not relevant to what I&#x27;m trying to do most of the time.     I would like to end that with a story of explaining the cost to develop a new feature to a co-worker. (He didn&#x27;t work on the project, by the way.) He just couldn&#x27;t believe my estimates, the conversation was something like:             Me: Well, I guess this thingie will take us about a day.        Co-Worker: Are you sure? You haven&#x27;t done anything in this area yet.        Me: Yes, we need to build all the UI from scratch, which is why it will take so long. It is mostly showing the data to the user, but there is some complex UI stuff we need to do here.        Co-Worker: But you don&#x27;t have anything that get the data!        Me: So, it&#x27;s just querying the database for it?        Co-Worker: But you haven&#x27;t written anything to do it yet.                 .. a couple of minutes goes by where I just can&#x27;t understand what he is talking about                 Co-Worker: Look, you have not done this, and you didn&#x27;t allocate any time for it, how can you keep you estimate?        Me: Like this&#xA0;[notepad] Container.Repository&lt;EmployeeContract&gt;().FindWhere(Expression.Eq(&quot;Employee&quot;,employee)) [/notepad], this will fetch us all the contracts for the employee, and we can then show them to the user, who can then do XYZ.        Co-Worker: But it doesn&#x27;t get you Salary and Bonuses for this contract.        Me: They are loaded when we load the contract, we don&#x27;t need to take care of it.        (EmployeeContract, Salaray and Bonus are fictional, of course, but the idea was that I needed to pull the data from 4 - 5 tables for this page.) The problem in this conversation was that I got the infrastructure to pull the data from the database with great flexibility, I don&#x27;t worry about how the database is structured, I let the O/R mapper take care of this.</p>

I recently had changed Rhino Mocks, NHibernate Generics and Brail.    This mean that I have to update the documentation of all three of them, and I&#x27;m less than excited about doing that :-(</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, I got a bug report today about something I knew I fixed. A StackOverFlow exception when overriding Equals(). Looking at the code, I did fix it, for 1.1 (this is one of the few places where there is a difference between the versions, unfortantely).    More unfortantely, I didn&#x27;t have a test for this, and I&#x27;m not sure why. IIRC, I got those exceptions by the dozens when I got this error, so I never bothered to write a spesific test for it. In hindsight, those exceptions where for Object.Equals(), which is not the same thing as the overriden method.    Looking at the code, it&#x27;s a true shame that I didn&#x27;t have a test for this, because it appears that I regressed with this scenario all over the place. I&#x27;m not sure how I can avoid this short of adding a couple dozens of tests that check all the code paths. So far I think that I got all of them. And I think that I&#x27;ll be much more careful with this in the future.    The problem is that the code that caused the problem looked like those two samples:                        if(proxy&#xA0;==&#xA0;invocation.Proxy)//explode&#xA0;with&#xA0;fireworks                            IMockedObject&#xA0;mock&#xA0;=&#xA0;proxies[proxy];//explode&#xA0;with&#xA0;fireworks&#xA0;as&#xA0;well                I&#x27;m really concerned about regressing with this one, since I&#x27;m not in the mood to add couple of dozens of tests, and I&#x27;m not sure how to handle this one. Anyway, I got a test for the main path, of course, which should catch most new things that I do.    You can get the sources and binaries from this page.</p>
