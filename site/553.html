            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been using Amazon EC2 and GoGrid recently, and I found myself spinning out a server to do a specific task (converting Subversion repository to git repository, copying a database, trying out VS 2010, etc).  Usually I do it because the cloud machines has a lot more bandwidth than I have locally, and I can also choose a specific OS &#x2B; services that match what I care for. I am not used to thinking about servers in this fashion, but I find myself doing it fairy often recently.  Interesting shift.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For the last year or so, I have been running my servers on GoGrid. The main reason for wanting to do that is because I wanted to run on a Windows 2008 server, and there was no good UI for managing EC2 at the time. I have been playing around with EC2, trying to see if this fit my needs better. Well, in reality, I was trying to see if locating a server instance in Europe would give me better latency when I need to administer the servers (it does).     Nitpicker corner: The following is a review of both providers for my scenario. I know that you&#x2019;ll ignore that, but do try paying attention to the fact that I am talking about my scenario, and not yours.    After playing around with EC2 for several days, I came with the following conclusions. GoGrid &amp; EC2 only looks similar. They are actually two different offering targeting different types of scenarios.  EC2 is to handle clouds, period. Server instances are meaningless, except maybe by their role. They come &amp; go as they please and they are utterly disposable. That makes it great if what you want to do is have a cloud. It is very hard if what you want is just running server instances.  For my purposes, I don&#x2019;t want to have a cloud of indistinguishable machines, I want to be able to run a lot of different sites on different machines. Maybe I want to have a set of machines for a single site, but I still want to be able to clearly and easily separate the machines that run nhprof.com and the ones that run ayende.com.  That made working with EC2 really uncomfortable, to tell you the truth. They don&#x2019;t support anything like naming an instance, which make sense, from their point of view. You should not get attached to an instance, you should get attached to an image of that instance.   That doesn&#x2019;t work quite that well for my case, however. I was willing to accept this limitation, but I run into a few others that were deal breakers for me.     Amazon EC2 doesn&#x2019;t support Windows 2008. This is really annoying, both because there are some features that I could have used and because Windows 2003 (their only Windows offering) is not supporting RDP saved passwords, and doesn&#x2019;t support copy/paste in the login screen. Both of which make it horrible login experience with the crazy passwords Amazon assign.     No good way to recover an instance. I setup an instance, told it to install security updates, and rebooted it. It didn&#x2019;t come up. I am not sure what I am supposed to do in this case. You have to enter a support contract to recover this, as far as I could tell (and I wasn&#x2019;t willing to do so just for the trial). It seems that the response would have been: &#x2018;just recreate the instance&#x2019;.     Long instance provisioning time. Spinning up a new instance in EC2 seems to take about 15 &#x2013; 30 minutes, which is annoyingly long. Yes, I know about reserved instances, not applicable for my scenario. (GoGrid feels faster, but I don&#x2019;t have any data to say if it is faster).   GoGrid, on the other hand, takes a drastically different approach.    Basically, they give you a server farm, you can create instances of machines, name them and manage them as individuals. They do support Windows 2008, and their support is phenomenal.   I have been running nhprof.com there for a long while, and overall, I love what they are doing, their support level and the experience.  Their main disadvantage compared to EC2 was that they didn&#x2019;t support cloning an image, they fixed that a while ago, which makes me very happy.   This subtle difference, from focusing on set of instances to focusing on an instance, is a huge benefit for my scenario, because it allows me to manage the different parts of my infrastructure directly, instead of indirectly or via brute force.  One thing to note about both of them. They both consider instances to be disposable. If you have problems with a server, you are probably better off just creating a new instance and setting that up.  GoGrid is better than EC2 here, because they will try to salvage a dead instance, but you should have a backup and the means to restore it on a new machine ready, in the end, it is much easier than the alternative.  I am using a backup service (Mozy, if you care) for all my servers, and that takes care of that.   Note that my scenario is that I care about running my existing applications on a server in the cloud, not running in the cloud. That is why I didn&#x2019;t even consider something like Azure of AppEngine. They don&#x2019;t matter for this scenario.   If I was building a new application that required scaling, it would probably be a different sort of decision matrix, with potentially a different result.  From pricing perspective, they seems comparable. GoGrid says that they are cheaper, but they would :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had a problem in one of my applications, a Lucene search was returning more results than I wanted it to, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure what was going on.     I pre marked the problematic line, but at the time, I had no idea why it is returning me all those extra results that had nothing to do with my queries. But since NH Prof gave me the full Lucene query text, I could take this and plug this into Luke.     Luke is the preferred tool to working with Lucene indexes, and running the query allowed me to play around and figure out what my problem was:     I was specifying that everything that is active MUST be returned, and everything that matches the query should be returned. Obviously, anything that is active (regardless of the rest of the query), must be returned.  In effect, this is similar to this SQL query:          select * from Entrieswhere IsActive = 1 or ( ... )&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Once I figured that one out, it was pretty easy to fix the query to use MUST_NOT IsActive == False. But it would have been much harder without NH Prof.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that I like about Git is that I don&#x2019;t have to think about operations that I make in my source. For example, I am working on the refactoring from NH Prof to &#xDC;berProf, and I wanted to change the directories &amp; project files. So I just went to explorer and renamed them.  Then I had to fix some namespaces references in the project file. It looks like this:     Notice that it capture both the rename and the content change?  You can also see how it looks in the log file:     Trying to do stuff like that with SVN is just PITA, with Git, I didn&#x2019;t have to think about it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My previous post relating to the business side of software seems to have met with positive reception, so here is another one. Let me know if you like it, or if you are interested in tech only content.  My father told me the secret for getting rich when I was just a little boy. It goes like this:     Buy cheap    Sell high   Unfortunately, I think that the .COM bubble made it clear that two yuppies in the living room don&#x2019;t really add value that would make people buy from them.  So another strategy is needed.   One of the nicest past times is day dreaming.   Here are&#xA0; a couple of nice dreams of getting rich quick:     If I make this widget, I can sell it for 50$. It is going to cost me 15,000$ to write it, but then every sell is practically free. I only need 300 sales to start earning money! If I sell just a 1,000 of them, I am going to earn 35,000$, and I can keep selling it forever.    It is like Manna from Heaven!    Or this one, which should be more familiar to anyone who isn&#x2019;t in software:     I can go to the bank and get a mortgage on this house, they will cover 90% of the cost, so I only need to bring 15,000$ to get it. I pay 15,000$ and I have a 150,000$ assets in my hands. Mortgage payments is only 1,000$ a month for 15 years.     I can rent it for 1,500$, so the house covers the mortgage and I get 500$ a month for doing nothing. In 2.5 years, I get my original 15,000$ back, I still have the house, which is going to be worth 175,000$. I can sell it then and make 35,000$ profit!    It is like Manna from Heaven!   Now, I think that you can agree with me that those are pretty common thought patterns for people. They are also true. Think about it, wouldn&#x2019;t you want to make 200% &#x2013; 300% profit in a short amount of time?  Both schemes are valid ways to do so. Well, sort of.  The problem with the two schemes outlined above is that they have (in technical terms), absolutely no error handling. In fact, people paint the picture in terms so rosy that I suffer from pink overload.  Generally speaking, there are few things that hold true in business as well as this statement:      The higher the return on investment, the higher the risk.   With the real estate example, let us say that you have a month in which you have no renters, can you pay the mortgage? Out of your own pocket, that is. If not, you are likely to start spiraling down. And if you can pay the mortgage, can you pay city tax? What happen when you have a renter that is there, but doesn&#x2019;t pay? You got legal costs to evict them.   And that is completely ignoring something like the current recession.   Just to give you some idea, you bought the house, rented it, and on the third month, the renter stopped paying rent and refuse to leave. It is going to take 30 days to evict them, and another 2 weeks to get a new renter. Your out of pocket expenses are going to be 2,000$ for the mortgage (for the two months in took to resolve things), another 1,500$ for the legal fees and probably at least two bottle of anti acid for your ulcer.   Oh, you might be able to recover some of the costs if you go after the renters (add more legal fees), but that assumes that they are able to pay, and the money is only going to show up sometimes in the future (if at all). In the meantime, you have better be able to cover the unexpected 3,500$ expense that just dropped in your lap.  With software, let us say that you quit your job to work on your widget. You spent a lot of time &amp; effort on that, then you start selling it. In the first three months, 50 people buy it. Your underlying assumption about the number of buyers was overly optimistic. You are out of a job, out 12,500$ and feeling cheated.  Where it the Manna from Heaven?!  One of the things that I like about being in the army is that it thought me to plan. I can write an pretty good op plan, and that is close enough to a business plan. Most op plans have standard sections:     Goal    Mission    Our forces    Enemy forces    Obstacles    Dangers    Contingency plans    Abort   Whenever you are going to plan something big, you have to sit down and plan for the things that are going to bite you in the ass. I generally try to divide things into two categories. Contingency plans are for when the situation is recoverable. Abort is for when it isn&#x2019;t, and I want to get out with as little damage as possible.  With software, that means that you have things like user studies, betas, etc. With real estate, I am not an expert so I am not going to comment. I would say that not getting in over your head is a good plan no matter what.  Final thoughts, figure out what your exit strategy is before you go in.  Figure out the cost of that exit strategy along with the cost of entering the game in the first place. That is the amount of money that you are putting on the table. And another final word of advice, that money is at risk, and the higher the return, the higher the risk. If you want to sleep well at night, make sure that you aren&#x2019;t risking the money that you need to buy bread.</p>
