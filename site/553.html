Up until the 6th drink, I am perfectly coherent (at least I seems to be as far as I can tell), it is with the 6th that things starts to fall over rapidly, including memory loss about an hour after the last drink.&#xA;That list isn&#x2019;t enough to give me hangover, though. I am still experimenting with that, but I think that mixing some blue drinks along the way would do the trick.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was sitting with Julie Lerman today, and we got into a discussion on how to provide more information to EF users. It appears that there is much need for that.   This is what I do, more or less, so we decided to tackle that problem in the bar. Some drinks later, we had a working version of EF Prof that was actually able to intercept all queries coming from the Entity Framework. Initial testing also shows that I&#x2019;ll be able to provide much more information about EF than I&#x2019;ll be able to do with Linq to SQL.  Unfortunately, the current way of intercepting EF traffic is extremely invasive, and I don&#x2019;t really like it. I consider it a good proof of concept, but I am going to spend some of next week trying to figure out a less invasive approach.  In the meanwhile, take a look (not the final look &amp; feel):         And here is the project that we profile:         It supports all the usual niceties, so you get stack trace support, tracking selects (including lazy loading), updates, inserts &amp; deletes. And I tested it on both EF 3.5 and EF 4.0.  I expect to have a private beta starting next week&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I love the WoT series. My nickname, Ayende Rahien, is based on that series. So you can imagine how happy I was to start reading the Gathering Storm.   There are no spoilers in this post, I a going to spend some time digesting the book and then post a review about the actual details of the book.  What make this book unique is that the author was changed (the original author died), which caused a huge delay for this book and caused sever worries whatever the new author would be as good as the original.  I can tell you that I personally had not been able to figure out the original scenes vs. new author scenes. It does seems like there are less feminine clothing discussion (which I consider to be a great plus).  It is probably hard to see, but the cover art is still as bad as the previous ones, which also make me nostalgic.  This book focuses mostly on Rand, with some really interesting developments. There hasn&#x2019;t been enough Rand in the last two books, so that is good. On the other hand, I could do with more Matrim scenes.  Things are moving, rushing pretty fast, actually. The book is a page turner, it is a 784 pages book that I finished in one seating, taking about 12 hours.  I can&#x2019;t wait to read the rest.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The very first draft of Impleo (my CMS system), was based on sound design principles. It had good separation between the different parts (it actually had 4 or 5 projects). At some point I took a look at the code and couldn&#x2019;t find it. There was a lot of infrastructure, but nothing that I could actually point to and say: &#x201C;This is the application logic&#x201D;.  I decided to take a different approach, created a new WebForms project, and started everything from scratch. I ported some of the code from the original solution, but mostly we just built new stuff. I stubbornly decided that I am going to apply YAGNI here, so I just scrapped everything that I usually do and started a typical web forms project, no IoC, no testing, nothing.  As expected, initially we had a really nice velocity, and if I had to hold my nose a bit during some parts, I was willing to go with that.  The next stage with Impleo, however, is to turn it from just a content management system into a website framework. The difference between the two are significant, while a CMS is just about content, a website framework allows you to add custom pages and application behavior. There is an added difficulty in that I want to use Impleo for multiple sites, doing different things.   That turn it from just a custom application to a platform, and the roles there are quite different. For that, just going with the approach that I used so far would have been disastrous. I tried, and spiked some things, but none of them made me&#xA0; happy. I decided that I really need to stop, and since I have a working version, I can &#x201C;refactor&#x201D; it to a better shape. I put refactor in double quotes intentionally.   My method included creating a new MVC project, add some integration tests and then porting everything from the WebForms to the MVC project. Overall, it was a pretty simple, if tedious, process.   The most difficult thing along the way was that I was doing this while I was flying, and for some stupid reason, I could either charge the laptop battery or use the laptop, so I had to make frequent stops to recharge.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Occasionally I need to do development stuff things that are potentially destructive.   The ResetDatabase action will blow away the database, which I need to do for tests and when I am making big changes. But what I absolutely does not want is to have in production.        My method is to require three different things to be true to enable this:     You must issue a local request (so you are physically on the machine where the system is sitting).    You are logged on as a user and as an administrator (that is the superAdmin part).    You are running on a debug build.   Hopefully, I won&#x2019;t blow the production database.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">That really depends on the type of application that you write and what kind of operations team it is going to have.  I have applications that I setup, then forget about (this blog being one of them). In those types of applications, having a log in production is a burden, I need to purge it occasionally, or write the code to purge it automatically.   Then I have applications that have a strong operations team, where people are looking at the application every single day. An alert raised from the system is actually going to be looked at by a human before irate customers start calling. In those cases, a lot is pretty important, and understanding how to properly distinguish between real errors (human needs to look at) and transient ones (do a review once a month) is pretty important.  Setting things up is that I have production sites log only error conditions, which is pretty common, is also a mistake, as a simple example, I had once seen a log that where 40% of the errors where users coming back to the site after the session has timed out, and the error was leading them to the error page.  The way I try to do things is:     Pay attention to messages that arrive to the error queue, see if there is anything that can be done about them.    Log &amp; alert any time that an error crosses the system boundary (if the users see an error page, I really want to know about it).    Setup things so I can change log levels in productions without restarting / redeployment, etc.   Please note that I am making a distinction here between developer&#x2019;s log and audit trails or operations information. Depending on the type of system that you have, and the requirements on it, those two can be a gold mine when trying to troubleshoot issues.  Providing things like performance counters or access to internal state in your application is also important. For example, being able to ask the app for the worst performing queries is a great way of troubleshooting perf issues. Or querying the cache miss ratios, etc. It isn&#x2019;t just logging that gives you visibility into the system.  Something that I haven&#x2019;t had the chance to do yet (but that I would like to try) is to plug the NH Prof backend (which is basically an event aggregation and analysis system) as a way to analyze log streams. That way, even if you do have some logging turned on, it doesn&#x2019;t stay in its raw form, but is translated to something much more concise and understandable.</p>

One of the things that I wasn&#x2019;t told about when I agree to write the book is just how many times I would have to read it. I think that I am good writer (God knows that I get enough practice), but for crying out load, there is only so many times that I can read the same piece (especially if I wrote it) before it gets pretty boring.  Now, to be absolutely clear, the publisher is doing great job, and I think that each pass has been extremely valuable. We found problems in grammar, spelling, fuzzy speak, missing concepts, bugs in code, etc. This is important, valuable and necessary.  One of the things that some people have hard time understanding about the way that I think is that I can accept that some things are necessary even if they aren&#x2019;t fun. That mean that I&#x2019;ll do them, but I&#x2019;ll complain about it. Just like taxes. I&#x2019;ll pay them, but I reserve the right to bitch about it.  It took me a while to understand why I hate editing so much. I know how to handle boring work, and I know how to handle creative work. What I don&#x2019;t know how to handle is boring creative work. I split my attention when I am doing boring stuff, usually having something in the background that it interesting while I am doing the boring stuff. For creative stuff, I usually enjoy it.  But boring creative stuff? I can&#x2019;t split my attention then, and it is boring. It is annoying, and I do think about it like a tax.  Consider this statement, that was flagged by my editor:     The MacroMacro passes the MacroStatement that the compiler hands to the macro using the name of the macro   Can you figure out what I meant here? It took me a while to do that :-)  Editing the book has been a huge weight on my mind, having finished that is such a huge relief&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A while ago I was chatting with a friend that complained about a migration script timing out on his local machine. When I looked at the script, it was fairly obvious what was wrong:     DECLARE @VideoID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER&#xA;DECLARE @NewID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER&#xA;&#xA;DECLARE VideoCursor CURSOR READ_ONLY&#xA;FOR&#xA;SELECT ID FROM Video&#xA;&#xA;OPEN VideoCursor&#xA;&#xA;FETCH NEXT FROM VideoCursor&#xA;INTO @VideoID&#xA;&#xA;WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0&#xA;BEGIN&#xA;    SET @NewID = NEWID()&#xA;   &#xA;    INSERT INTO Content (ID, Body, FormatBody, Plain)&#xA;        SELECT @NewID, ContentItem.Body, Video.FormatBody, Video.Plain&#xA;        FROM ContentItem&#xA;        INNER JOIN Video&#xA;        ON Video.Id=ContentItem.ID&#xA;        WHERE Video.Id=@VideoID&#xA;   &#xA;    UPDATE Video SET ContentId=@NewID WHERE Video.Id=@VideoID&#xA;       &#xA;    UPDATE ThumbImage SET ContentId=@NewID WHERE Video_id=@VideoID&#xA;   &#xA;    FETCH NEXT FROM VideoCursor&#xA;    INTO @VideoID&#xA;END&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;The script was using a cursor!&#xA;&#xA;Every time you want a use a cursor, you must fast for three days while reading the memoires of Edgar F. Codd.&#xA;&#xA;Cursors are evil!&#xA;&#xA;Let us see how we can make this work using set based logic, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  INSERT INTO #TempContent &#xA;SELECT newid() as NewId, Video.Id as OldId, ContentItem.Body, Video.FormatBody, Video.Plain&#xA;FROM ContentItem&#xA;INNER JOIN Video&#xA;ON Video.Id=ContentItem.ID&#xA;WHERE Video.Id=@VideoID&#xA;&#xA;INSERT INTO Content(ID, Body, FormatBody, Plain)&#xA;SELECT NewId, ContentItem.Body, Video.FormatBody, Video.Plain&#xA;&#xA;UPDATE Video &#xA;SET ContentId=NewId &#xA;FROM #TempContent&#xA;WHERE Video.Id=OldId&#xA;&#xA;UPDATE ThumbImage &#xA;SET ContentId=NewId &#xA;FROM #TempContent&#xA;WHERE Video.Id=OldId&#xA;&#xA;DROP TABLE #TempContent&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I can assure you that this will work faster, read better, get parallelize by the database and in generally be better behaved than the previous version.</p>
