            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, I am sitting there quietly trying to get EF Prof to work in a way that I actually like, when all of a sudden I realize that I am missing something very important, I can&#x2019;t see the generated queries parameters in the profiler.   Looking closely, I started investigating what appear to be a possible SQL injection issue with EF. My issue was that this query:          entities.Posts.Where(x=&gt;x.Title == &#x201C;hello&#x201D;)&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Generated the following SQL:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    SELECT1 AS [C1],[Extent1].[Id] AS [Id],[Extent1].[Title] AS [Title],[Extent1].[Text] AS [Text],[Extent1].[PostedAt] AS [PostedAt],[Extent1].[BlogId] AS [BlogId],[Extent1].[UserId] AS [UserId]FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [Extent1]WHERE N&#x27;hello&#x27; = [Extent1].[Title]&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;It literally drove me crazy. Eventually I tried this query:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    var hello = &quot;hello&quot;;entities.Posts.Where(x=&gt;x.Title==hello);&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Which generated:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    SELECT1 AS [C1],[Extent1].[Id] AS [Id],[Extent1].[Title] AS [Title],[Extent1].[Text] AS [Text],[Extent1].[PostedAt] AS [PostedAt],[Extent1].[BlogId] AS [BlogId],[Extent1].[UserId] AS [UserId]FROM [dbo].[Posts] AS [Extent1]WHERE [Extent1].[Title] = @p__linq__1&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This was more like it. &#xA;&#xA;It seems (and Julie Lerman confirmed it) that EF is sticking constant expressions directly into the SQL, and treating parameters differently. &#xA;&#xA;I am not quite sure why, but from security standpoint, it is obviously not a problem if it does so for constants. It have a lot less hair now, though.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">&#xDC;ber Prof is the codename for the multi-OR/M profiler that I have been working on for the last several weeks.   Today is a good milestone, because it marks the shift from treating it as an experimental to production ready.     &#xDC;ber Prof also brings with it several changes to the way I mange the profiler profiles. Each profile (NHProf, HProf, L2SProf and EFProf, currently) is built on top of the same codebase, but contains slightly different functionality to fits it target audience. I might talk about exactly how we are doing that in a later post.  That required making a small number of breaking changes:     The executable filename was changed to NHProf.exe (or HProf.exe, or L2SProf.exe, etc)    The appender filename was changed to HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.dll    The appender type name was changed to HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender.[profile].[profile]Profiler.Initialize();   In practice, those changes are annoying, but should be very easy to fix.  Something important to note, however, is that NHibernate profiling and Hibernate profiling has been split.  For NHibernate, we have NHProf, and for Hibernate, we have HProf.   I hope to have L2sProf out in public beta this week. And EFProf is currently in private beta for this week and hopefully poke its nose out as public beta next week.  Updates:     There is going to be a bundle, yes. No details yet on what it will be, though. I am leaning more toward a discount model rather than a bundle, since it seems that it would be more appropriate.    People who already bought NHProf license can use that for HProf as well with no issues.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My post about applying YAGNI in Impleo has gotten a lot of comments, and instead of answering them one at a time, I think it would be useful to just have a post answering all of them together.     Ryan Riley: I suppose I&#x27;m still wondering, how did WebForms appear as a result of YAGNI? I realize that&#x27;s the original ASP.NET platform, but MVC seems simpler to me, and even simpler would be starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or, heaven forbid, classic ASP) with some AJAX.   Ryan, it is quite simple. It is all about friction, using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript would have added more friction initially than the webforms solution.     Torkel: Any plans to open source it?   Highly unlikely.     Andrew: I know we all hate Web Forms, yada yada yada, but if you need to just setup a few pages, it&#x27;s dead easy and much faster than MVC, a WCF service or any other method to deliver content.&#xA0; Hence why it makes perfect sense in this &quot;I&#x27;m using YAGNI to the letter of the law&quot; experiment.      But the reality is, you rarely have a project where you can work in this pure YAGNI way, since there almost always is requirements such as make it testible, make it easy to maintain, make it SOE friendly, etc. so working in ASP.NET Webforms a poor choice for the job.&#xA0; But there does come a time where a project is &quot;All we need is one page that shows data in a grid&quot;, it can be done in literally 10 minutes with a WebForm.   I agree, except that there is an additional thing that I want to bring to the table. The most important thing for me in most of my apps is the first customer demo. That is important for a host of reasons, but most importantly, because it make a product real. Building fancy architecture and buzzward compliant development is usually in the way of that. The first customer demo is simple, stupid and should be out as soon as possible.     Dmitriy Nagirnyak: &#xA0;    Your own website framework?     Hmm.      What are the reason for starting it from scratch if there are some of them already available?      - Exercise?      - Lack of extensibility?      - Wrong architecture?      - &quot;Just want my own&quot; thing?      - others?   Quite simple, I wanted something that would work the way I need it to work. Anything that adds friction to the process is not acceptable. I am willing to build my own thing to get a friction free process.     Richard Dingwall: Article starts with YAGNI and ends up writing a whole new CMS from scratch! Ayende!!   See previous reply.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This started out as a support question, but it is an interesting enough (and general enough) that I think it is important to make sure that it is recorded.  When working with detached entities (from another session), sometimes, at seemingly random places, NHibernate will throw a NonUniqueObjectException. Where it actually happen and the exact cause depend on several variables, but the root problem is simple: working with detached entities safely requires that you be aware of possible identity map violations.  Let us look at some code and then I can explain:          using (var session = sessionFactory.OpenSession())using (var tx = session.BeginTransaction()){    // get the entity    post = session.Get&lt;Post&gt;(postId);     // force the association to be eagerly loaded    System.Console.WriteLine(post.User.Username);     tx.Commit();}using (var session = sessionFactory.OpenSession())using (var tx = session.BeginTransaction()){    // get the user for the entity    var anotherUser = session.Get&lt;User&gt;(post.User.Id);    // will return false    ReferenceEquals(anotherUser, post.User);    // opps, user instance with the same id but with different    // reference was detected    session.SaveOrUpdate(post);    tx.Commit();}&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The reason that the problem seems obscure at first is that there are quite a few variables that are going to affect how this will behave. In order to reproduce the issue you need:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  An association that is marked with a cascade option, such as &#x201C;save-update&#x201D;, &#x201C;all&#x201D; or &#x201C;all-delete-orphan&#x201D;&#xA;&#xA;  The entity this association points needs to be loaded in the second session.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Depending on what you are doing (saving an entity vs. updating it) and what the options are for the id generation, you may get the error on the SaveOrUpdate or on the Commit.&#xA;&#xA;The actual details are pretty unimportant, but understanding what is going on is. The issue is that NHibernate has been asked to perform something that violate one of its core assumptions, break the identity map.&#xA;&#xA;Because of the cascade options set on Post.User, we are asking NHibernate to also save the User instance associated with the post. The problem is that when NHibernate is encountering that, it is going to see an entity with an id that is already on the session but as a different reference. That violates the identity map rules and force NHibernate to throw an exception.&#xA;&#xA;The root cause is, as I mentioned, trying to work with a detached entity as if it was a regular entity. NHibernate provides a different API for working with detached entities safely, precisely because of those sort of reasons.&#xA;&#xA;The appropriate way of handling such an issue is to use the Merge method, which will take a detached object graph and merge it into the session, properly resolving such conflict. Note, however, that Merge will return a different entity instance than the one that you passed. &#xA;&#xA;Let us look at the code:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  using (var session = sessionFactory.OpenSession())using (var tx = session.BeginTransaction()){    // get the user for the entity    var anotherUser = session.Get&lt;User&gt;(post.User.Id);    // will return false    ReferenceEquals(anotherUser, post.User);    // will merge the detached entity into the session    // creating NEW entity instance or re-using the one    // that is already in the session    var mergedPost = (Post)session.Merge(post);    // will return false     ReferenceEquals(mergedPost, post);    // will return true    ReferenceEquals(anotherUser, mergedPost.User);    tx.Commit();}&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;As you can see, this is a fairly small change, and NHibernate now takes care of wiring up everything correctly even in the face of conflicting changes. &#xA;&#xA;You can play around with the code here:&#xA;&#xA;http://github.com/ayende/nhibernate-blog-model/tree/non-unique-object-execption&#xA;&#xA;http://github.com/ayende/nhibernate-blog-model/tree/non-unique-object-execption-resolution</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was sitting with Julie Lerman today, and we got into a discussion on how to provide more information to EF users. It appears that there is much need for that.   This is what I do, more or less, so we decided to tackle that problem in the bar. Some drinks later, we had a working version of EF Prof that was actually able to intercept all queries coming from the Entity Framework. Initial testing also shows that I&#x2019;ll be able to provide much more information about EF than I&#x2019;ll be able to do with Linq to SQL.  Unfortunately, the current way of intercepting EF traffic is extremely invasive, and I don&#x2019;t really like it. I consider it a good proof of concept, but I am going to spend some of next week trying to figure out a less invasive approach.  In the meanwhile, take a look (not the final look &amp; feel):         And here is the project that we profile:         It supports all the usual niceties, so you get stack trace support, tracking selects (including lazy loading), updates, inserts &amp; deletes. And I tested it on both EF 3.5 and EF 4.0.  I expect to have a private beta starting next week&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I love the WoT series. My nickname, Ayende Rahien, is based on that series. So you can imagine how happy I was to start reading the Gathering Storm.   There are no spoilers in this post, I a going to spend some time digesting the book and then post a review about the actual details of the book.  What make this book unique is that the author was changed (the original author died), which caused a huge delay for this book and caused sever worries whatever the new author would be as good as the original.  I can tell you that I personally had not been able to figure out the original scenes vs. new author scenes. It does seems like there are less feminine clothing discussion (which I consider to be a great plus).  It is probably hard to see, but the cover art is still as bad as the previous ones, which also make me nostalgic.  This book focuses mostly on Rand, with some really interesting developments. There hasn&#x2019;t been enough Rand in the last two books, so that is good. On the other hand, I could do with more Matrim scenes.  Things are moving, rushing pretty fast, actually. The book is a page turner, it is a 784 pages book that I finished in one seating, taking about 12 hours.  I can&#x2019;t wait to read the rest.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The very first draft of Impleo (my CMS system), was based on sound design principles. It had good separation between the different parts (it actually had 4 or 5 projects). At some point I took a look at the code and couldn&#x2019;t find it. There was a lot of infrastructure, but nothing that I could actually point to and say: &#x201C;This is the application logic&#x201D;.  I decided to take a different approach, created a new WebForms project, and started everything from scratch. I ported some of the code from the original solution, but mostly we just built new stuff. I stubbornly decided that I am going to apply YAGNI here, so I just scrapped everything that I usually do and started a typical web forms project, no IoC, no testing, nothing.  As expected, initially we had a really nice velocity, and if I had to hold my nose a bit during some parts, I was willing to go with that.  The next stage with Impleo, however, is to turn it from just a content management system into a website framework. The difference between the two are significant, while a CMS is just about content, a website framework allows you to add custom pages and application behavior. There is an added difficulty in that I want to use Impleo for multiple sites, doing different things.   That turn it from just a custom application to a platform, and the roles there are quite different. For that, just going with the approach that I used so far would have been disastrous. I tried, and spiked some things, but none of them made me&#xA0; happy. I decided that I really need to stop, and since I have a working version, I can &#x201C;refactor&#x201D; it to a better shape. I put refactor in double quotes intentionally.   My method included creating a new MVC project, add some integration tests and then porting everything from the WebForms to the MVC project. Overall, it was a pretty simple, if tedious, process.   The most difficult thing along the way was that I was doing this while I was flying, and for some stupid reason, I could either charge the laptop battery or use the laptop, so I had to make frequent stops to recharge.</p>
