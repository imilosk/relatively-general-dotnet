            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I waited for a while after my article was posted, to see if anyone caught on to some of the things that I did in the sample code that weren&#x2019;t related to NHibernate usage. It seems that no one caught on to that, so I&#x2019;ll try pointing them out explicitly.  The basic format of a feature in Effectus is this:     Each feature have a Presenter (business logic for the feature), a View Model, which is directly bound to the View and is the main way that Presenter has to communicate with the View. The main responsibility of the Model is to be bound to the UI, and allow the presenter to update it, but it is not quite enough.  The UI also need to raise events and handle user input. A common example is handling button clicks. You can&#x2019;t really map them into Model behavior, at least not easily and in a way that make sense to the developers. Instead, I defined a set of conventions. As you can see in the picture, based on the name of the element, we match is with the appropriate execute method and the way to decide if the command can execute. Under the cover, we generate the appropriate ICommand instance, bound to the Presenter behavior.     If you look at the code, you can see that the conventions extend even to handling the selected item changed in a list box, including passing the newly selected instance back to the presenter. Those conventions are project specific, based on what the project need, and they result in a code base that is very easy to read and follow. Moreover, they result in a codebase that is relatively free from infrastructure concerns.  I am going to have a few more posts about Effectus, can you figure out what else I put in that code base?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It took me a while to get around to this blog post, I promised Glenn that I would write it ages ago.  The title of this blog post, which is admittedly provocative, refer to a (I believe intentional) misinterpretation of a comment of mine in a MEF talk. It might also explain my general attitude about software in general.  MEF is a pretty big library, and it does a whole host of things. But when talking about it, there are specific features that keep getting mentioned over and over, probably because they are:     Really nice features.    Demo very well.   A good example of that is MEF ability to import new types on the fly. It is something really nice, but it isn&#x2019;t something that is really impressive to me. Doing dynamic loading isn&#x2019;t really hard. That has led me to make the comment that turned into the title of this post.  The actual comment I made was: &#x201C;I can implement this feature (dynamic loading) in less than two hours.&#x201D; The problem is that that was interpreted as saying that I can implement MEF itself in 2 hours (just to be clear, it isn&#x2019;t possible). What is possible, however, is to implement interesting parts of MEF for a particular scenario in a short amount of time.   In fact, most of the time, I can implement the features that I find attractive in some software (not limited to MEF) faster than I can learn how to use that software in the first place. Granted, it may be a single purpose, only-works-under-the-following-set-of-assumptions implementation, but it will work, it will be faster out of the gate and it will limit the number of dependencies that I have to manage.  It is something that you have to consider, because sometimes you want to put those responsibilities at the hands of some other party because you don&#x2019;t want to deal with that. Sometimes you explicitly want to do it yourself because giving up control on this thing (or adapting to the way some library does it) is not acceptable.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For a long time, most of the work in the profiler (NH Prof, HProf, L2S Prof &amp; EF Prof) could be done only with the use of the mouse. That annoyed a bunch of people, but it didn&#x2019;t really bother me.&#xA0; Rob fixed this recently, and I cannot believe what kind of a difference it makes.  Here are the shortcuts:              S        Focus on Sessions tab header                  T        Focus on Statements tab header                  D        Focus on Details tab header                  F        Focus on Statistics tab header                  Left / Right        Move to the next / prev tab                  Down / Up        Move to next session / statement          Using those, you can use the common functionality of the profiler without touching the mouse.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got into a very interesting discussion with Rob Conery recently, talking about, among other things, the CodePlex Foundation. You can hear it TekPub&#x2019;s Podcast #2, when it is out later this week. Tangential to our discussion, but very important, is how an Open Source project owner defines success for their project.  Usually, when people try to judge if an open source project is successful or not, they look at the number of users, and whatever the general response for the project is positive. But I am involved in a lot of open source projects, so you might say that I have an insider&#x2019;s view on how the project owner view this.  Now, let us be clear, I am talking about OSS project that are being led by an individual or a group of individuals. There are different semantics for OSS projects that are being led by a company.  There are several reasons for individuals to be involved in OSS projects, those are usually:     Scratch an itch &#x2013; I want to do something challenging/fun.    Need it for myself &#x2013; This is something that the owner started because they needed it themselves and open sourced it for their own reasons.    Reputation building &#x2013; Creating this project would give me some street cred.    I use it at work &#x2013; Usually applicable for people joining an existing project, they use it at work and contribute stuff that they require.   We must also make a distinction between OSS adoption and OSS contribution. Typically, maybe a tenth of a percent of the adopters would also be contributors. Now, let us talk about the owner&#x2019;s success metric again. Unless the owner started the project for getting reputation, the number of people adopting your project is pretty meaningless. I think that DHH , the creator of Ruby on Rails, did a great job describing the owner sentiment:  I&#x27;m not in this world to create Rails for you. I&#x27;m in this world to create Rails for me and if you happen to like that version of Rails that I&#x27;m creating for me, than you are going to have a great time.  Even if you are interested in OSS for reputation building, after a while, it stops being a factor. Either you got your reputation, or you never will. A good example of a project started to gain reputation is Rhino Mocks. And you know what, it worked. But I think that it is safe to say that I am no longer just that Rhino Mocks guy, so the same rules applies as for the other motivations.  So, what does it mean, from an owner perspective, when you ask if an OSS project is successful or not?&#xA0; The answer is simple: it does what I need it to do.  I asked a popular OSS project owner the following question: What would your response be if I told you that I am taking a full page ad in the Times magazine proclaiming your stuff to be the best thing since sliced bread? You&#x2019;ll get a million users out that that.  His response was: Bleh, no!  Tying it back to the discussion that I had with Rob, I feel that much of the confusion with regards to the CodePlex Foundation role is when you try to talk to projects led by individuals as if they were commercial enterprises. The goals are just completely different, and in many cases, adding more users for the project will actually be bad for the project, because it put a higher support cost for the project ream.  In the .NET ecosystem, most of the projects aren&#x2019;t being led by a company. They are led by individuals. That is an important distinction, and understanding it would probably make it clear why the most common response for the CodePlex Foundation was: What is in it for me?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that the profiler is supposed to do is to handle large amount of data, so I was pretty bummed to hear that users are running into issues when they try to use the profiler in high load scenarios, such as load tests.  Luckily, one of the things that the profiler can do is output to a file, which let me simulate what is going on on the customer site very easily.  The first performance problem is that the profiler isn&#x2019;t processing things fast enough:     The second is that there are some things that just totally breaks my expectations     There are solutions for those problems, and I guess that I know what I&#x2019;ll be doing in the near future :-)</p>
