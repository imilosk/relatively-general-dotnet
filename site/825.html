        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When you should make a decision? This is an interesting question that goes beyond software design and into real life as well. I thought that I would share my philosophy about making decisions, and when I make the final cut.     The issue here is not about split second decisions, of course, it&#x27;s about those decisions you&#x27;ve time to prepare for, but may not have all the data avialable. From development, it may be that you&#x27;re considering the design of your application, but you are also waiting for the release of some component that you depend on. From real life, you know you are going to get a new team mate in two weeks, but you&#x27;re not sure what his abilities are.    I had to make many such decisions while I was in the army, and I learned one thing. If I can do it at all, it was best not to decide until I had to decide. Each and every time that I tried to make a decision base on partial information, I was wrong. Most times, even when I did have all the information, by the time that decision was relevant, it wasn&#x27;t the right decision. Since then, I adopted a philosophy that basically says:Never make a decision until the time that decision is relevant.     This doesn&#x27;t mean that you need to wait until you&#x27;ve all the information, often enough you have to make a decision before you&#x27;ve the information. But waiting will usually give your more information that you had before. One thing that this technique require, though, is that you&#x27;ll consider all the options that you have to make this decision, without trying to find the best one. (I can put the new guy on Marketing, R&amp;D or QA...)    Exploring the options will make sure that when you need to make the decision, at least you&#x27;ll have a good idea about what are the implications of the decision. I have found this to work in most areas of life, and I attempt to apply it whenever I can.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x27;d a problem with how to implement a spesific feature which I couldn&#x27;t see a clean way to do. It&#x27;s just something that came up that I don&#x27;t need to do right now, but will have to do in the future, and this may have some serious ramifications later on. I&#x27;m a firm advocate of delaying decisions, so I just let the subject drop, thinking that I&#x27;ll tackle it when I need to.    When I woke up today, I was still groggy, so I sort of turned over and tried to go back to sleep, and the solution to that problem just sort of came up to me. The feature in question is changing databases per each request when using NHibernate &amp; ActiveRecord. Because of the way ActiveRecord works, I never have to explicitly open/close connections, so that was worrying. I just woke up today knowing exactly which part of ActiveRecord was responsible for the stuff that I needed, and with an easy way to make it work.    I&#x27;m not sure if it is a good sign or not. Should I be concerned that I dream of Castle?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Wesner&#xA0;has a post&#xA0;about how to monetize your blog that strike me as interesting.    I started to write this blog in April 2004, and I really cranked the volume of that shortly after that. I usually blog because I have something to say, and that is a good place to put it. Some time ago I put a Google ad on the page, hoping that at least it will generate some cash to pay the bills for the hosting. It didn&#x27;t really work. So far I didn&#x27;t even get a payment from Google.    Wesner mentions two ways to make money from a blog:                            Tip Jar. Readers can voluntarily donate money to show their appreciation for value received through the blog.                    Buy Your Own Blog Entry (BYOBE). In exchange for writing specific content, he will charge $100 for a post. This is far higher than the $10 that I originally proposed.        What do you think of those? If I put a PayPal account that you can donate to (for the content in the blog and/or for the software I produce), will it work? What about the second option? I&#x27;m willing to listen to offers to write a (well researched) blog post about a subject. Any takers?    But beyond money value, there is a huge networking effect to having a blog. I recieve several job offers via my blog. I talk with a lot of very smart people, I get to influence some decisions (Microsoft&#x27; VS 2005 Service Pack announcement was at least in part because of all the noise in the blogs).    The most important thing, though, that this is fun. I love developing, I love writing (and when I did it, I love presenting and teaching). I&#x27;m considerring myself very lucky, to be able to do the things that I love.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Kzu has found a bug in the .Net framework. The issue boils down to the framework saying that: Yes, sure you can convert the string &#x27;Foobar&#x27; to int.    Microsoft response is:    We do not have the luxury of making that risky assumption that people will not be affected by the potential change. I know this can be frustrating for you as it is for us.    Go read the discussion there, and please vote for this. I fail to see a scenario where a working program would break because of this change. Backward compatability is important, but this is way over the top.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, you probably noticed by now&#xA;that I&#x27;m talking a lot about the amount of queries that a page makes. Right now&#xA;I managed to drop it from 91 to 72 (didn&#x27;t test in the process, and wasted tons&#xA;of time) from 72 to 63 (tested in the process, took minutes). It was all about&#xA;putting lazy in the right places (and fixing the tests that assumed that the&#xA;data is always there).&#xA;&#xA;I then tried to find out exactly where&#xA;most of the traffic was, the first part was an easy target, just finding out that&#xA;I made a couple of dozen calls for the exact same data was a big relief. I used&#xA;the ASP.Net Cache, and that dropped the number of queries to 41.&#xA;&#xA;Then I was stumped. I knew what was&#xA;going on, but I didn&#x27;t know how to fix it. I&#x27;d the following problem:&#xA;Blog-&gt;Posts-&gt;Comments. Where I need to do some processing on blogs that I&#xA;thought was also involving the comments. The result of that was two statements&#xA;to load the blog and the posts, and another 38 statements to load each post&#xA;comments. Looking at the code, I realized that I didn&#x27;t really need the comments&#xA;for that particular process. (I likely will never need them for a blog-wide&#xA;process). Marking the Comments as lazy dropped the number of queries to three.&#xA;If I was really desperate, I could have gone to two (which is minimal&#xA;amount of statements that I could produce manually). I don&#x27;t choose to do that&#xA;because&#x2026; well, that would mean that the UI would have to make decisions&#xA;about how the data would be loaded.&#xA;&#xA;I rather leave that decision outside&#xA;of the UI layer at the moment. It&#x27;s not a problem to add this feature, but the difference&#xA;between two or three queries is not big enough to justify adding responsibilities&#xA;to the UI that don&#x27;t belong there.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Paul&#xA;Graham has an article about Great&#xA;Hackers that is worth reading. (I listened to the podcast, and&#xA;it&#x27;s much better when you can hear him speaks than just read the text). Joel has a very good article about Leaky&#xA;Abstractions (although no podcast about that).&#xA;&#xA;Put those things together, and you&#xA;can get a fairly good idea about why leaky abstractions are so annoying&#xA;for developers. If you read my blog you&#x27;re aware of much hair pulling and gnashing&#xA;of teeth in regards to ASP.Net that has been going on lately. Most of the&#xA;problem is that I don&#x27;t really understand what is going on under the hood. On&#xA;the other side, I&#x27;ve had a similar experience with NHibernate and ActiveRecord.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;I had a page that had to display a&#xA;list of records from the database. Currently the database holds ~5 rows. The&#xA;page loaded very quickly, but I took a look at the profiler to see what kind of&#xA;SQL statements were executed and I nearly had a scream fit about it*. 18 statements&#xA;for loading 5 rows? All of them in the same table? I got into a short argument&#xA;(with myself, this time) about the usefulness of an ORM that generate such&#xA;lousy code. I then put a couple of dozens of Lazy = true in various places in&#xA;my code, and watch the page load again. There was only one SQL statement this&#xA;time, and while it wouldn&#x27;t pass the code police (horrible names), it&#xA;did the work. For a moment, though, I had a very real sense of what would&#x27;ve&#xA;happened if another developer, who isn&#x27;t familiar with NHibernate or&#xA;ActiveRecord would have with the same problem. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;The second issue that I had was a&#xA;matter of cascading. I thought that I had information, because I created it and&#xA;then saved the root object to the database. But when I tried to get the&#xA;information, I couldn&#x27;t find it. The issue is (probably) that I didn&#x27;t&#xA;configure the cascades properly. I think that I fixed this by adding the proper&#xA;cascade (I&#x27;m writing this post in the breaks that I have to take because of the&#xA;long compile times for ASP.Net). Adding cascades broke the tests, which&#xA;require some fixing, but it was very straightforward, most of the time.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;Okay, I usually try to have a point&#xA;with my posts, so let&#x27;s try to give this one at least moderate one. The issue&#xA;here is about control; understanding and how leaky is the abstraction. NHibernate&#xA;is great, and I think that I cut in more than half the time that&#xA;I need to spend thinking about data access. In fact, it&#x27;s so good that I don&#x27;t&#xA;think about it most of the time. &#xA;&#xA;Implementing the Session-Pre-Request&#xA;and Session-Per-Test is very straightforward using ActiveRecord, and it is a&#xA;joy to work with. I had written some very bad application in the past (and I&#x27;m&#xA;sure that I&#x27;ll say it again in the futureJ),&#xA;and I distinctly remember the amount of thought that I had to dedicate to building&#xA;any non-trivial queries. Keeping an eye on what is going on under the covers is&#xA;good, but it is so good not having it in your face all the time.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;* One SQL statement was so&#xA;horrendous it was 5KB(!!) and had 11 joins! I couldn&#x27;t follow it, and I was too&#xA;afraid to see what the execution plan looked like.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Mario Gutierrez has a post about&#xA;limiting the configurability of the system. One of the things that he said&#xA;really caught my eye:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;The other 20% will&#xA;require the usual manual effort by the developer.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I find that I much rather have a&#xA;solution where I need to write a little code to make the hard parts work, than&#xA;have a complex framework that tries to do anything (look at XSD for an example,&#xA;if you need one.)&#xA;&#xA;I would like to dispute his other&#xA;claim, that DB portability is not important. It&#x27;s not important for an in-house&#xA;project, yes. But the moment you need to integrate a project into an existing infrastructure,&#xA;you&#x27;ll soon find that it&#x27;s not going to be that simple. Some people use SQL&#xA;Server, some favor MySQL, some like Oracle, etc. You probably wants to sell to&#xA;all of them. DB portability is an important feature in most applications that are&#xA;going outside.</p>
