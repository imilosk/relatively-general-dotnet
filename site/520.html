        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Just a few words about the way that I setup Raven to be used in the MVC Music Store application before we get to the actual code.     The model is (intentionally) very close to the one used by NHibernate. We initialize the document store in the application start.     We then open/close the session on request boundary, and create a way to access the current session.     If the application supported a container, I would make sure that the controllers got the session instance through that, but it doesn&#x2019;t, so I just used static gateway.             If you don&#x2019;t like, feel free to submit a patch.               public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication&#xA;{&#xA;    private const string RavenSessionKey = &quot;Raven.Session&quot;;&#xA;    private static DocumentStore _documentStore;&#xA;&#xA;    protected void Application_Start()&#xA;    {&#xA;        _documentStore = new DocumentStore { Url = &quot;http://localhost:8080/&quot; };        _documentStore.Initialise();&#xA;&#xA;        AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();&#xA;&#xA;        RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public MvcApplication()&#xA;    {&#xA;        BeginRequest &#x2B;= (sender, args) =&gt; HttpContext.Current.Items[RavenSessionKey] = _documentStore.OpenSession();&#xA;        EndRequest &#x2B;= (o, eventArgs) =&gt;&#xA;        {&#xA;            var disposable = HttpContext.Current.Items[RavenSessionKey] as IDisposable;&#xA;            if (disposable != null)&#xA;                disposable.Dispose();&#xA;        };&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public static IDocumentSession CurrentSession&#xA;    {&#xA;        get { return (IDocumentSession) HttpContext.Current.Items[RavenSessionKey]; }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;This is pretty much it, as far as Raven&#x2019;s initialization is concerned.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There appears to be some confusion with regards to RavenDB licensing terms. In part, this is because some people believe that it is priced too highly.  There is currently a debate going on in the mailing list, which I suggest you&#x2019;ll join. Yes, I am open sourcing the decision process for the pricing model :-)  That said, leaving the pricing aside, we still need to consider the licensing terms, and what they mean. RavenDB is dual licensed, which means that it is available under a standard commercial license and under the AGPLv3 license. The AGPL is one of the most restrictive OSS licenses. Interestingly enough, if you ask the authors of the AGPL they will probably say that it is one of the most free OSS licenses, but that is a discussion for another time.   The AGPL is similar to the GPL in that it is viral, but it has the additional property that it defines distribution as also including web requests and computer networks. (Oversimplifying a bit, I know, but that is why the AGPL FAQ exists).  RavenDB licensing terms are pretty simple:      You can use RavenDB with OSS projects (OSI approved licenses), and you don&#x2019;t have to modify your license to match RavenDB&#x2019;s licenses. The AGPL doesn&#x2019;t normally allow it, RavenDB contains a specific exception to allow that.    If you want to use RavenDB in commercial closed source software, you need to buy a commercial license.   The last statement is where most people have an issue with, so let me be even clearer:  If you are using RavenDB for an internal application that no external user will access, then the distribution clause never comes into effect.     Note, however, that distributing AGPL applications also include making them available to users / systems outside your own organization.    Well, the previous point isn&#x2019;t strictly true, even for internal users, in order to comply with the license, you must allow them a way to get the source.   What if you are using RavenDB as a backend server for your application? RavenDB is never accessed from the outside, so it is not distributed. And even the AGPL doesn&#x2019;t say that making a web request to an AGPL server forces you to be AGPL&#x2019;ed. That would be an accurate point, except that RavenDB comes in two pieces, one of which is the server, but the second is the client API. And if you use the client API (which is also licensed under the AGPL), your application now must be AGPL&#x2019;ed.  That is not a problem, right? RavenDB is a REST based system, you can just write your own client, and license that under the BSD.  Not quite.   Why is that? Because of something called a derived work. If you creating a standard HTTP client (PUT, GET, DELETE, etc) that can work against RavenDB, there is nothing that would stop you from doing that. If, however, your client is built to take advantage of RavenDB&#x2019;s specific features (replication, transactions, batching, patching, etc), then it stopped being a standard HTTP client and became a derived work of RavenDB. At which point, as you probably guessed, the AGPL kicks in again.  All the legalities aside, my intent is that if you use RavenDB commercially, you pay for a commercial license.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The MVC Music Store release came as a fortunate surprise, I wanted to write a sample application for Raven, and having someone else write all the hard bits (the UI :-)) for me and leave to just replace the data access is just about ideal. The overall goal is to touch absolutely no JS/HTML code in the app, replacing just the controllers. It would be interesting to see if I&#x2019;ll manage to do that.  The database model for the application is:     You can see some interesting things in the schema immediately:     The Cart table should probably be called CartLineItem, because it stores a row per item in the cart.          The CartId is not an foreign key, but a reference to the user name or the session id.       The Artist table only hold the artist name, there is no other data.   With this information, I think that the following data model would be appropriate:  Albums        The album document contains a reference to the Genre as well as the Genre&#x2019;s name. This allows us to display the album without having to refer to the Genre document.    The album document contains the artist name and id, for much the same reason.    There isn&#x2019;t actually a set of Artist documents in the database. We don&#x2019;t keep any information about an artist, except its name, so I didn&#x2019;t see a reason to introduce it at this time.   Genre         The genre document is an exact duplicate of the Genre table, no surprises here.   Cart     The cart is a pretty common document format, we have a single document and it contains an array of elements where the relational model contained a set of rows. Note that the UserIdentifier is where we store the user id or the session id for the cart.  Order     Order is another pretty standard document format. We aggregate all the order information to a single document, and we aggregate related information (Address) to a specific node.  Artist  There is no artist document.  Why does Genre deserve a standalone document while Artist gets subsumed into Album?          For the simple reason that the application does something with Genres (if only just displaying their description) where the only thing that is done with Artists is displaying their name in the context of an album. At this point, I consider Artist to be wholly owned by album, so there is no reason to keep a separate document for it. The only reason that album&#x2019;s artist have and artist id is that I am assuming (based on the data) that the source for artist is an external system that does something a bit more meaningful with it than keep the artist name around.  This is just one half of the work we need to do, we have defined the data model, now we need to consider how this is used in a broader context, and add the query model using indexes. That will be covered in a future post.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I thought that it would be a good idea to take EF Prof for a spin one the sample MVC Music Store. It can illustrate some things about EF Prof and about the sample app.   The first step is to download EF Prof, once that is completed, extract the files, there is no install necessary.  We need to reference the HibernatingRhinos.Profiler.Appender in the application:  &#xA0;   Then, from the Global.asax Application_Start, we initialize the profiler:       That is all the setup that you need to do :-)  Now, we go to http://localhost:1397/, and we can see the following in EF Prof:     There are several interesting this to see here.      We executed three queries to load the main page.     We actually opened four object contexts to handle this request.    We have a query that generate a warning.   Let us deal with each one in turn:  Multiple queries for the same request. This requires analysis because often we are querying too much. But in this instance there is no problem, we are querying different things and we are doing so efficiently.  Four object contexts to handle a single request is bad. We can see that each query was actually executed through a different object context (and one was idle). There are several problems with having multiple object contexts per request:     Each object context would open its own connection to the database. I am not sure, but I think that they do so lazily, which means that a single page request resulted in three connections to the database.    Each object context implements its own unit of work. You might get two different instances that represent the same row in the database.     You can&#x2019;t aggregate all your operations into a single SaveChanges() call, you have to make multiple trips to the database.    You require using System.Transactions and distributed transactions if you want to ensure a transaction boundary around your code.   In short, there are a lot of good reasons to go with request scoped object context, you should do so.  Now, let us look at that query with the warning:     EF Prof generated a warning about unbounded result set for this query. What does this mean? It means that if you had 100,000 genres, this query would attempt to load all of them. I am not an expert on music, but even I think that 100,000 genres are unlikely. The problem with these sort of queries is that it is likely that the number of genres will grow, and not adding a TOP or LIMIT clauses to the query means that you are open to problems when the data does grow.  And with that, let us see what happens when we look at a single album (http://127.0.0.1:1397/Store/Details/392):     This is pretty much the same as the before, with 5 queries required to process this required, but let us dig just a tiny bit deeper:     What we see here is that we have queries that are being generated from rendering the views. That usually trips a warning flag with me, because queries that are being generated from the view are likely to cause problems down the road, data access patterns should rarely change because of view changes, and that is usually and indication that at some point, we will have a SELECT N&#x2B;1 here.  Now, let us try to add a new item to the cart (http://127.0.0.1:1397/ShoppingCart/AddToCart/669):     We can see that adding an item to the cart is a two steps process, first, we go to /ShoppingCart/AddToCart/669, then we are redirected to /ShoppingCart. Overall, we require 8 queries in two requests.  Let us look at the actual queries required to process AddToCart (note, however, that we are talking about two different object contexts):     Look at the first query, I don&#x2019;t see us doing anything with the data here. Let us look a bit more closely on where it is generated:     And AddToCart looks like this:        It seems that the ShoppingCart.AddToCart requires an album instance, take a look at it, and see what it does with it. The only thing it does is to use the album id. But we already know the album id, we used that to get the album instance in the first place.  It seems that the first query is there solely to check that the value exists and throw an error from the Single() method. I think we can optimize that:      We removed that query, but we preserve the same behavior (if the application tries to save a new cart item with a missing album id, a FK violation would be thrown). Querying the database is one of the most expensive things that we can do, so it pays to watch out to where we can save in queries.   Now, let us add a few more items to the shopping cart and see what happens :-) I added 6 albums to my cart, and then went to (http://127.0.0.1:1397/ShoppingCart):     Wow! We require 10 queries to process this request, and you can see that EF Prof is urgently requesting that you&#x2019;ll take a closer look at the last three.     EF Prof has detected that we have a SELECT N&#x2B;1 error here, where we issue a query per album in the shopping cart. If we will look at the stack trace, we will find a familiar sight:     We have queries being generated from the views, in this case, from this code:     You can see that on line 47, as shown in the profiler, we are access the title property of the album, forcing a lazy load.  Tracking it further, we can see that Model.CartItems is set here:     And that GetCartItems is defined as:     And this generate the following query:     Well, that is easy enough to fix :-)     Which result in this query:     We now bring all the related albums in a single query. Which means that viewing the shopping cart result in:     Just four queries, instead of 10!  Not too shabby, for 15 minutes work with the profiler, even if I say so myself.             In general, when I am developing applications, the profiler is always running in the background, and I keep an eye on it to see if I am doing something that it warns me about, such as SELECT N &#x2B;1, multiple contexts in the same request, too many calls to the database, etc.</p>

Here is an example of how I think about he tests that we currently have:              &#xA0;        Command        Result                  Replicating PUT        PUT raven1/docs/ayende        200                  &#xA0;        GET raven2/docs/ayende        200                  Replicating DELETE        PUT raven1/docs/ayende        200                  &#xA0;        GET raven2/docs/ayende        200                  &#xA0;        DELETE raven1/docs/ayende        201                  &#xA0;        GET raven2/docs/ayende        404</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The example on the right is from the new MVC Music Store sample, and it show a way of designing software that was quite popular in the end of the previous century and the early part of this century.  In part, it was wildly popular because of the type of infrastructure that was available to build software on. In you consider the time frame, that was the height of COM and the golden age of EJB. Both sets of infrastructure focused on stateless components manipulating &#x201C;entities&#x201D; that were just data holders.  The reason why there was such a focus on statelessness? Creating objects used to cost a lot at the time, especially since you needed a reference to those objects across servers, so you really had no better choice than going with this approach.   Why should this style be retired?  Well, let us consider what we have, tight coupling to the environment in which it runs and lot of explicit queries to the database. I could live with either easily, especially since the sample is intended to serve as a guide for beginners.   What really bothers me is that we now have the behavior related to working with our model scattered high and wide. Okay, that isn&#x2019;t quite fair. Most of the logic in the system reside in the ShoppingCart component. What bothers me is that we have:     By that I mean, we have the controllers directly query the persistent DTOs that we have. This leads to situations such as this:     This is a controller method, I really don&#x2019;t think that it should be concerned with the type of foreign keys and cascade relations that we have on the database. There is another issue here, that the sharp eyed among you might have noticed, there is no shared unit of work (data context in this case). Each different component is going to access the database through its own data context, meaning that you have multiple ways of getting the same persistent DTO back, through different connections, getting different instances, on the same request.  In short, the problem with component oriented design is that it separate data from behavior and lead to a scattering of the knowledge about the actual data structure and access pattern throughout the application.  I would much rather see behavior moved into the entities (upgrading them from persistent DTOs to actual entities), querying being centralized in a repository and a single unit of work that applies to the entire request.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I designed Raven, one of the things that were very clear to me was that I wanted to be able to take advantage on existing features in the framework to the greatest degree possible. This means that I don&#x2019;t have to reinvent the wheel, and it means that Raven&#x2019;s users will be able to understand what is going on and how to utilize Raven much more easily.  One of those decisions was to use Linq as the format for defining indexes. All other document databases use Javascript as their index definition format (yes, I know you can use Ruby for CouchDB, that isn&#x2019;t the default / common approach). But .NET already has this nice syntax, and it already gives me so much information OOTB, and users already know how to make linq do all sort of crazy stuff. That reduce support questions, not to mention that it is a sexy little feature.  We are running those linq queries on the server (doing dynamic compilations and a bunch of other stuff). The problem is how to get them to the server. We have a really nice UI, to do so, of course:   But when it comes right down to it, it is a couple of text boxes, and users may want to be able to define indexes via code. That is perfectly understandable, but it means that users have to do something like this:     documentStore.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(&#xA;    &quot;UsersByRegion&quot;,&#xA;    new IndexDefinition()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = @&quot;from user in docs.Users select new {user.Region}&quot;,&#xA;    });&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;If you cringe when you see that, welcome to the club. This is still more or less okay, but indexes can get complicated, like this guy:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  store.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(&quot;GameEventCountZoneBySpecificCharacter&quot;,&#xA;                    new IndexDefinition&#xA;                    {&#xA;                        Map = @&quot;from doc in docs where doc.DataUploadId != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.RealmName != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.Region != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.CharacterName != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.Zone != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.SubZone != null&#xA;    select new&#xA;    {&#xA;        DataUploadId = doc.DataUploadId,&#xA;        RealmName = doc.RealmName,&#xA;        Region = doc.Region,&#xA;        CharacterName = doc.CharacterName,&#xA;        Zone = doc.Zone,&#xA;        Count = 1&#xA;    };&quot;,&#xA;                        Reduce = @&quot;from result in results&#xA;        group result by new&#xA;        {&#xA;            DataUploadId = result.DataUploadId,&#xA;            RealmName = result.RealmName,&#xA;            Region = result.Region,&#xA;            CharacterName = result.CharacterName,&#xA;            Zone = result.Zone&#xA;        } into g&#xA;        select new&#xA;        {&#xA;            DataUploadId = g.Key.DataUploadId,&#xA;            RealmName = g.Key.RealmName,&#xA;            Region = g.Key.Region,&#xA;            CharacterName = g.Key.CharacterName,&#xA;            Zone = g.Key.Zone,&#xA;            Count = g.Sum(x =&gt; x.Count) &#xA;        };&quot;});&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I could tolerate the first example, I couldn&#x2019;t tolerate this one. I spent a lot of time exploring how I can get things setup so you&#x2019;ll be able to use linq (including all the usual strong typing goodies) on the client to define server indexes. The short answer is that a complete solution would take about a month of development. A workable solution can be used by serializing expression tree on the wire. But that would produce the following index definition on the server:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;That is not an acceptable option for me.&#xA;&#xA;But if we limit the scope to &#x201C;just get it working and accept that it won&#x2019;t handle 100% of the cases&#x201D;, the problem become much easier, and we can now do this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  documentStore.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(&quot;UsersByLocation&quot;,&#xA;    new IndexDefinition&lt;LinqIndexesFromClient.User&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = users =&gt; from user in users&#xA;                       select new { user.Region }&#xA;    });&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;And that would show up on the server as:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;It isn&#x2019;t the original expression, but it is clear enough, I think.&#xA;&#xA;What about that monster query? We can now write it like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  documentStore.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(&quot;GameEventCountZoneBySpecificCharacter&quot;,&#xA;    new IndexDefinition&lt;Game.GameEvent, Game.GameEventCount&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = docs =&gt;&#xA;            from doc in docs&#xA;            where doc.DataUploadId != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.RealmName != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.Region != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.CharacterName != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.Zone != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.SubZone != null&#xA;            select new&#xA;            {&#xA;                doc.DataUploadId,&#xA;                doc.RealmName,&#xA;                doc.Region,&#xA;                doc.CharacterName,&#xA;                doc.Zone,&#xA;                Count = 1&#xA;            },&#xA;        Reduce = results =&gt; from result in results&#xA;                            group result by new&#xA;                            {&#xA;                                result.DataUploadId,&#xA;                                result.RealmName,&#xA;                                result.Region,&#xA;                                result.CharacterName,&#xA;                                result.Zone&#xA;                            }&#xA;                            into g&#xA;                            select new&#xA;                            {&#xA;                                g.Key.DataUploadId,&#xA;                                g.Key.RealmName,&#xA;                                g.Key.Region,&#xA;                                g.Key.CharacterName,&#xA;                                g.Key.Zone,&#xA;                                Count = g.Sum(x =&gt; x.Count)&#xA;                            }&#xA;    });&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Well, this will turn into this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;It isn&#x2019;t as nice as the original query, I&#x2019;ll admit, but it is still highly readable.&#xA;&#xA;And yes, it takes scary code to get there :-)</p>
