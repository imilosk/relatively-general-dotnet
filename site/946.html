            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Josling (the father of Java) was quoted&#xA0;talking about C#, Ruby and PHP. It&#x27;s amazing how such a short piece can annoy me so much.     First, I did very short work with PHP (and really couldn&#x27;t stand the dot operator for concantation), and virtually no work with Ruby. I work quite a bit in C#, as you probably know. I don&#x27;t know of any usages of PHP outside the web, but I can certainly think of usages for Ruby outside the web. Ruby != Rails !! Ruby is used in WATIR&#xA0;(wrapper for IE&#x27;s COM interfaces), Stocks watcher, File Systems, etc (just from looking at RubyForge for a couple of minutes).    The comment that really irritated me was:We were afraid they [C#]&#xA0;were going to do something really creative - but they&#x27;re hopelessly focused on one platform.    I understand that there are some people to whom cross platofrmism is the holy grail. But I just don&#x27;t get this type of attidute. Platforms don&#x27;t really mean anything without applications, and application are created when developers like a platform. If developers don&#x27;t like a platform, it will quickly be delegated to the legacy benches, to chat with Cobol to the end of time.    To claim that .Net is not relevant because it is focused on Windows in to turn a blind eye to the truth. First, this claim is not true, I can run my applications on Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac&#xA0;OS&#xA0;X, and Unix. I can run it on anything from a honking server to a phone. No, it&#x27;s not as portable as Java, and it will probably not run on AS400. For the relevant applications, I can take the same assemblies, and use them on all those platforms (you can&#x27;t run an ASP.Net app on your phone, though).    That said, I would still consider this irrelevant. There are some great advantages to Java, but I would consider this mainly in the culture and maturity of the development community. Most of the tools that I use daily have their roots in Java (NHibernate, NUnit, NAnt). Hell, I can trace the roots of Rhino Mocks to Easy Mocks.Net, which is a port of Easy Mocks, a Java mocking framework.    I don&#x27;t see any ground breaking differences between Java and .Net, to tell you the truth. There are some things that I like in .Net that I can&#x27;t do in Java (real generics, anonymous methods, yielding, nullable value types, consistent types), but nothing that I really couldn&#x27;t live without. I&#x27;m certain that there are things that Java does that .Net doesn&#x27;t (and I like the syntax of anontations more than attributes).     I&#x27;m very surprised to hear such a dismisal from Josling. If he thinks that Java&#x27;s biggest advantage is its cross platform capabilties, something is wrong. As a developer, I don&#x27;t care where my code is running (unless the environment will affect my code, of course). That is the job for the integration stage. I do care about productivity, richness of the langauge, ability to mess around with stuff, etc. If I don&#x27;t like the environment that a platform is giving me, I&#x27;m highly unlikely to use it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The term &quot;churning code&quot; has no direct equivalent in Hebrew, sadly. I did a code churn of ~12,000 Lines of code a couple of weeks ago, and I got some... peculiar results. I recently got a call from a co-worker about a piece of code that I wrote during this churn. The code was something like:             SELECT                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; OrderId,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Avg(Price)                        FROM Orders                        GROUP BY OrderId, Price            For some reason, this code produced the wrong results. I was gently asked what I was thinking when I wrote this piece, and I really couldn&#x27;t provide a decent explanantion. At least fixing this mistake was easy, if I weren&#x27;t doing much the same thing in four other spots, in big queries.    *Sigh* I heard somewhere that the output of the average programmer is ~20 lines of debugged code a day. It&#x27;s not really surprising, actually. I knew it during the churn, now i need to find out just how much more such WTF are awaiting me.     By the way, if you work in a code base long enough, you learn to read the patterns of the code well enought that you no longer need to read the code. From the structure of the code you can figure out what is it trying to do (if not why, or the sepsific of the how). Do it long enough and you can &quot;restructure*&quot; the code to be much nicer, without reading the code.&#xA0; The problem with this method is the result above.    Boy, is legacy programming fun or what?     * It is not refactoring unless I have tests in place.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I routinely work on several machines, and this mean that while I can&#x27;t really get used to my specialized environment, since then my ability to do stuff on other machine is damaged. And there is nothing quite as frustrating as the computer not responding to a command. Because of this, I started to learn a lot more about the default settings in Windows and VS.Net.    Here is a simple example. I know of almost no-body that uses the Alt&#x2B;Space shortcut. But it&#x27;s so nice. I no longer close windows with Alt&#x2B;F4, since that require me to stretch my hand. Instead, I close them by Alt&#x2B;Space - C. This is slightly longer, but I can do it in one hand, and it doesn&#x27;t require me to move my hand from its customary position. Alt&#x2B;Space - X is useful as well, for maximizing application.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing my reply about Celemens&#x27; O/R post, I thought that I would give a more real world example of the secnarios. Here is my schema:          I think that this is a pretty standard schema (if a bit simplified) for shipping orders to customers. Now, let&#x27;s say that I want to show the customer all his orders, and let him see the details of each order. Here is my objects for this application:          So far so good,&#xA0; I would assume? There shouldn&#x27;t be any major objections unless I&#x27;m missing something really big. Now, let&#x27;s say that I want a sophisticated DAL that I can use with the Unit Of Work&#xA0;pattern.&#xA0;I spend a couple of hours refreshing myself with Fowler&#x27;s and Evans&#x27; books, and then I set to the task. It&#x27;s not a trivial matter, but it&#x27;s a very boring one, I think. Let&#x27;s start with the overall design, I think that I can find three root objects, Customers, Products and Orders. This means that I will want the following DAL:          I&#x27;m not so sure about AddOrder() and CancelOrder() in the CustomersRepository, but I&#x27;ll leave it there for the meantime. Now that I&#x27;ve the design, I&#x27;ll probably use code generation to create stored procedures and most of the DAL. It shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to find pre-written code that does this, and it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to write if it isn&#x27;t avialable. I now can write the code to display a customer on a page:             Customer customer = customersRepository.FindCustomer(15);                        this.customerView.Customer = customer;         Simple, isn&#x27;t it? And not that much different from what I would get if I where using an ORM tool. Now, let&#x27;s try to display all the orders of the customer, shall we? At this point, we can use either of two ways. Let the repositories handle it, and access it naturally:             Customer customer = customersRepository.FindCustomer(15);        this.ordersGrid.Orders = customer.Orders;         Or explicitly access it via the OrdersRepository, like this:              this         .customerView.Customer = customer;    ICollection&lt;Order&gt; orders = ordersRepository.FindOrdersForCustomer(customer);    this.ordersGrid.Orders = customer.Orders;     The first way means that Customer should know whatever its orders have been loaded or not, and that it should talk to the OrdersRepository when it needs its orders. This way means that you can lazy load or not. The second way means that a Customer knows nothing about its orders, and that you always need to explicity access them from the OrdersRepository. This way does not allow for non-lazy load aproach.     Now, let&#x27;s consider a common scenario, that is currently not supported by this DAL. Displaying a list of all the orders and their order lines for a customer. Something like:             Order #14234534:        Sent to: Foo 34, Bar Via: Fedex        2 Bottles of water, 3.51$        ----------------------        Order #14234544:        Sent to: Foo 34, Bar Via: Fedex        6&#xA0;Bottles of lemon juice, 13.51$         In order to get that from the database, we need to:             Add a stored procedure that gets the data.                 Add a method to the OrdersRepository that calls this stored procedures and then takes result set from the stored procedure and put it into objects.         I would assume that the query would be similar to:             SELECT                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Orders.Id OrderId,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Destinations.Address,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Orders.DispatchMethod,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Products.[Name] ProductName,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; OrderLines.Quantity,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; OrderLines.Price                        FROM                                 Orders JOIN Destinations                        ON Orders.DestinationId = Destinations.Id                        LEFT JOIN OrderLines                                 ON Orders.Id = OrderLines.OrderId                        JOIN Products                        ON OrderLines.ProductId = Products.Id                        WHERE Orders.CustomerId = @customerId         It took me a couple of minutes to write &#xA0;this query, and it&#x27;s not a complex one. This is probably the best way to get all the data from the database in a single query. Does this sound familiar to you? I just do not believe that realizing that you need to another query should cause quite that much trouble. Using NHibernate (my ORM of choice) I can express the above query with:              from         Order o left join fetch OrderLine where o.Customer = @customer     But you know what, that is the cheesy example, it doesn&#x27;t really mean anything. It&#x27;s not the true benefit of ORM.     The true benefit of ORM is that it make it possible to use OOP when dealing with data. For instance, if I were building this system, I might chooce to create a FedExOrder and a UpsOrder, and discriminate on the DispatchMethod. This way, I don&#x27;t really care what dispatch methods an order has. It is handled inside the object, using the familiar encapsulation and seperation of concerns that I use elsewhere.     The data in this case is not a disconnected entity that my code is manipulating. There is no such thing as data only, there are objects that encapsulate the data and has responsabilities. That is why I like ORM so much. In the example above, all I need to do in order to write add air mail dispatching is to create an AirMailOrder. The integration between the data and the objects is the key here. It opens up a whole range of possibilities.     That said, it&#x27;s important to understand what we are working against. We are not working against the physical schema of the database. We are working against the logical structure of our objects. There is a mapping document that allows the ORM to translate our object structure to the database schema, but there doesn&#x27;t have to be any connection between the two. You are free to modify each independently, and writing an application that uses ORM doesn&#x27;t mean that you will not be able to use good database design ideas, or that the data will be inaccessible to other applications, which may not use the same ORM (or anything at all, for that matter).     If your schema changes, you update the mapping file, and you&#x27;re done. If you are worried about changing the schema for deployed clients, you can even put the file in the database, and have the client initialize itself by loading the latest schema from the database. I would say that worried about being unabled to change the database structure.     I just don&#x27;t see stored procedures and custom DALs as a good abstraction for the database, since more often than not, they are used blindly to map the schema to result sets or DTOs, without giving much benefit over the simple approach. If I want to truely seperate my applications from the database, I would use a Service (web or not is another matter), not a custom DAL.     The good thing about ORM is that you can use if for more than just databases, in one of my project, nearly everything was accessed via IRepository&lt;T&gt;, which was specialized to objects were persisted to the DB, objects that I got from external services, etc. I didn&#x27;t care how that happened. In this case, ORM was an implementation technique&#xA0;that greatly aided in the implementation of the database bound objects.     That is a good abstarction layer, in my opinion. Bulid a custom DAL when you can save quite a bit of time and effort on ORM is a waste, in my eyes. Premature optimization is bad, but so is premature abstraction.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was playing with SQL Server snapshots today, and they are very cool. The idea is that you can freaze your database at a point in time, and always refer back to it. The problem is that it costs you in terms of performance, and it may cost dearly.&#xA;The way that database snapshots are implemented is copy-on-write to sparse files, so when you create a snapshot, a sparse file (a file that is filled with zero, which the OS knows not to save to the disk, so you don&#x27;t waste space). Any time a page has to be written, it&#x27;s copied to the sparse file first, and then written to disk.&#xA;This means that you get double the I/O if you&#x27;ve a snapshot, but also that you get to see your database at the point you created the snapshot.&#xA0;It&#x27;s very cool, and restoring to the snapshot is very fast, compared to backups.&#xA;One problem that I run into is that I didn&#x27;t consider the cost of multiply snapshots, at one point I had seven snapshots of the same database, and I was wondering why operations was taking so long (I multiplied the I/O cost {which was significant to start with} by X8!).&#xA;Either way, this is a cool thing just technologically speaking. I&#x27;ve researched a bit of implementing this as a stream in .Net, but is seems that there isn&#x27;t a bulitin way to set a region in the file to zero data, and I don&#x27;t want to use P/Invoke to call DeviceIoControl().</p>
