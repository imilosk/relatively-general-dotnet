            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The first thing you&#x2019;ll see when you run RavenDB 3.5 is the new empty screen:  You get the usual &#x201C;Create a database&#x201D; and the more interesting, Create Cluster. In RavenDB 3.0 clusters were ad hoc things, you created them by bridging together multiple nodes using replication. In RavenDB 3.5, we have made that into a first class concept. Clicking on the &#x201C;create cluster&#x201D; link will give you the following:  And then you can start adding additional nodes:  RavenDB cluster is using Raft (more specifically, Rachis, our Raft implementation) to bridge together multiple server into a single distributed consensus. This allows you to manage the entire cluster in one go.  Once you have created the cluster, you can always configure it (add / remove nodes) by clicking the cluster icon on the bottom.  Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm, which allows a group of server to agree on the order of a set of commands to execute (not strictly true, but for more details, see my previous&#xA0;posts in the topic).  We use Raft to connect server together, but what does this mean? RavenDB replication is still running in a multi master node, which means that each server can still accept requests. We use Raft for two distinct purposes. The first of which is to distribute changes of operations across the cluster. Adding a new database, changing a configuration settings. This allows to be sure that such changes are accepted by the cluster before they are actually performed. But the one that you&#x2019;ll probably notice most of all is that shown in the cluster image, Raft is a strong leader system, and we use it to make sure that all the writes in the cluster are done on the leader. If the leader is taken down, we&#x2019;ll transparently select a new leader, clients will be informed about it, and all new writes will go to the new leader. When the previous leader recover, it will join the cluster as a follower, and there will be no disruption of service.&#xA0; This is done for all the databases in the cluster, as you can see from the follow topology view:  Note that while the leader selection is handled via Raft, the leader database is replicating to the other nodes using multi-master system, so if you need to wait until a document is present in a majority of the cluster, you need to wait for write assurance. The stable leader in the presence of failure means that we won&#x2019;t have the clients switching back and forth between nodes, they will be informed of the leader, and stick to it. This generates a much more stable network environment, and allowing you to configure the cluster details once and have it propagate everywhere is a great reduction in operational work. I&#x2019;ll talk more about this in my next post in this series. As a reminder, we have the RavenDB Conference in Texas in a few months, where we&#x2019;ll present RavenDB 3.5 in all its glory.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This series of posts are excerpts from the design work we have done for RavenDB 4.0. It isn&#x27;t everything, and some of that have been edited so it would make sense to outside people, without the benefit of the internal discussions. This is a high level design, that outline things at a very high level. Lower level features and practical design were left off and were done on a just in time basis. Don&#x27;t get too hang up on what this this contains, the idea is that we&#x27;ll use this as the basis for initial implementation, not concrete decisions.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;The overall idea is that we now have been working on RavenDB for the past 8 years or so, and we have amassed over half a decade of experience of running RavenDB nodes in production. We are running on literally millions of machines. That is not a typo, mind.&#xA;One of our customers has deployed to hundreds of thousands of machines. And we have multiple customers that have deployed to tens of thousands of machines. In fact, Rodrigo is going to talk about running RavenDB at Massive Scale in the RavenDB Conference in Texas in a few months. And obviously we&#x27;ll be speaking about RavenDB 4.0 there quite heavily as well.&#xA;&#xA;What this means is that we have quite a bit of experience in running code on a variety of environments, from the &quot;24/7 on site operations team for extremely powerful servers&quot; to &quot;maybe see a user once a day, mostly sitting on a crappy 8 years old machine running Windows XP in some warehouse doing useful work in the dark.&quot;&#xA;That experience have taught&#xA0;us quite a bit. You might have heard me before talk about all the taxes that you need to pay to actually release a feature. Those taxes are paid because if you don&#x27;t pay them, someone will give you call a 2 AM, and the newest engineer on the rotation (somehow it always happens this way) is going to have to gulp a cup of coffee and try to figure out what is wrong with a server on the other side on the world over the crappiest VPN connection that money can buy.&#xA;But what is more important, it also taught us what doesn&#x27;t work. Over the past couple of years we have been analyzing the pain points in our software, the areas where we always seem to be finding bugs, and typically nasty, hard to figure out, happen only in production, call us at 2 AM kind of bugs. You have seen some of the post mortem analysis on this blog, where we look at a production problem and try to get to the root cause.&#xA;Behind the scenes, there have been a lot of work done to find the rootest cause (not a word, I know, but perfectly express my point). Basically, try to find the common weak points. In many cases, it came back to certain places in our code where we had to do some really complex things to get things perform well.&#xA;Indexing is a huge part of RavenDB, obviously, and we had several issues there, but when it boiled down, we have a complex system that know how to make sure that indexing are running as fast as we can possible make them, and it involves prefetching, parallel processing, heuristics, adaptive behavior and a lot of other really cool stuff. And those things work, in almost all case. But when they don&#x27;t&#x2026; the complexity of all those interlaced features means that we need to first figure out what happened, realize that there is some faulty assumption along the way, fix that, then verify that the fix didn&#x27;t have any unintended consequences.&#xA;We have been doing that almost from day one, and by this point, the system is really smart, and it is able to take into account multiple resource types, unexpected behavior from hardware, unpredictable user behavior, surprising documents and some truly nasty indexes. So this is a very mature piece of code, with all that implies.&#xA;RavenDB 4.0 design is based on brain storming, &quot;if we had to do it all over again, rewind the clock to 2008, and design RavenDB from the ground up with all the knowledge that we currently have, what would we do differently?&quot;.&#xA;This post is getting too long, and I have a lot to talk about, but I think that this set the stage well enough. Next post I&#x27;ll deal with the fact that I haven&#x27;t invented a time machine yet, and given that I&#x27;ll be sure to tell my past self if I had, it is a safe bet that I will not invent a time machine in the future. Which is sad, and funny. My first thought about using a time machine is to improve software architecture, not getting some stock exchange tips.</p>

We even have a Nuget package for it, to make things easier all around.&#xA;&#xA;If you don&#x27;t know what Quartz.NET is&#x2026;&#xA;&#xA;&#x2026; a full-featured, open source job scheduling system that can be used from smallest apps to large scale enterprise systems.&#xA;&#xA;And was precisely what he did, which means that you can head to Quartz.NET with RavenDB, setup a couple of configuration options, and you&#x27;ll have this:&#xA;&#xA;This make it much nicer to look at what is going on, understand the various jobs, schedulers and triggers, and work with them. The fact that we can put pretty much all of it in once place means that we can have this:&#xA;&#xA;Instead of this:&#xA;&#xA;It also means that complex jobs, which require non trivial state (JobDataMap) have much easier time, because they don&#x27;t need to try to shove all of that into the relational model, they can just store the state as is in RavenDB as JSON values.</p>

This onboarding process is typically done by doing something tangential to RavenDB, which allows the new guys to learn RavenDB while doing something useful.&#xA;Past examples of this is the demo website for RavenDB, internal tools, etc. In the case of Idan, since he had an extensive Python background, we decided to give him as the intro task the job of writing a RavenDB client API in Python. This has several advantages:&#xA;&#xA;Instead of shifting rapidly from the environment he knows and is familiar with, we get a much gentler curve.&#xA;In order to actually implement it, he would have to become very familiar with the guts of RavenDB and how it actually works. Obviously that would be mostly on the client, but you can&#x2019;t really do that without also understanding what the server is doing.&#xA;We end up with a usable Python client.&#xA;&#xA;So, without further ado, let me show you how this looks like:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The Python client API can handle most CRUD scenarios, including full support for replication, failover, dynamic queries, etc.&#xA;It isn&#x2019;t the complete client, like we have for .NET or JVM, but it should do for most needs, and as usual, pull requests are welcome.&#xA;There is still a bit of work remaining (documentation, deployment, etc), but this is ready to take for a spin.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It feels like I took my eyes off the ball for a second, and suddenly I&#x27;m in an entirely new game.   We have been working with CoreCLR (the RC1 release from last year), and have been grateful to be able to run our software oh so easily on both Windows and Linux (heaven and earth difference from trying to run on Mono).  However, stuff changed. I know about the delay in shipping CoreCLR (and I&#x27;m whole heartedly approve it, we need something stable), and I have some rough idea about where the general direction is. But what is the current state? No idea. Googling this find me fragments of information, and not at all useful. The decision to go with NET Standard instead of the bazillion individual packages is something that I applaud. It should make our life easier. Except that when I tried that I run into a whole bunch of issues that caused me to stop trying for a time.  Basically, here is what I need to know is whatever there currently a way to get a CoreCLR (dotnet cli, whatever the current term is) on the latest framework / libraries that would actually make sense. In this context, make sense means that I get to do things like use Visual Studio normally (more or less) to build / debug my application. I&#x27;m fine with quite a lot of manual / scripts work, but I really like being able to debug. The nice thing about the RC1 bits is that it mostly works, you can debug it, profilers work, the whole thing. It is different than running on the standard framework, because some things don&#x27;t work, but that is something that we can work with. (In particular, no easy way to get pdbs for stuff like profiling is really annoying). When I read Hanselman&#x27;s post about the dotnet cli, I was quite excited. It made sense. But now I feel that instead of having all the usual power that I&#x27;m used to have plus all the conveyance of just opening a shell and start pounding code, it is the other way around. It is somewhat like being back working in perl. If stuff works, great, but if it isn&#x27;t, you might as well just start from scratch. I&#x27;m talking about the build system, the dependencies, &quot;how do I run this?&quot;, &quot;how do I debug this?&quot; questions.  What makes this worse is that there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a roadmap that we can peek at (not that I could find). I can see some discussions in chats and in issues, but there is no real &quot;this is where we are going&quot; sense. To explain some of my frustration, let me take my simplest project, which current contains the following details:    &quot;frameworks&quot;: {&#xA;    &quot;dnxcore50&quot;: {&#xA;      &quot;dependencies&quot;: {&#xA;        &quot;Microsoft.CSharp&quot;: &quot;4.0.1-beta-23516&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;System.Collections.Concurrent&quot;: &quot;4.0.11-beta-23516&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;System.Diagnostics.Debug&quot;: &quot;4.0.11-beta-23516&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;System.Diagnostics.Contracts&quot;: &quot;4.0.1-beta-23516&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation&quot;: &quot;4.0.0-beta-23516&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc1-final&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;Microsoft.AspNet.Server.Kestrel&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc1-final&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileProviderExtensions&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc1-final&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc1-final&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;Microsoft.AspNet.WebSockets.Server&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc1-final&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;NLog&quot;: &quot;4.4.0-*&quot;&#xA;      }&#xA;    }&#xA;  },&#xA;  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {&#xA;  }&#xA;&#xA;Now, I want to move this core from DNX RC1 to the latest release. So this probably will look like this:&#xA;&#xA;&quot;frameworks&quot;: {&#xA;  &quot;dnxcore50&quot;: {&#xA;    &quot;dependencies&quot;: {&#xA;      &quot;Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileProviderExtensions&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc1-final&quot;,&#xA;      &quot;Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc1-final&quot;,&#xA;      &quot;Microsoft.AspNet.WebSockets.Server&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc1-final&quot;,&#xA;      &quot;NLog&quot;: &quot;4.4.0-*&quot;&#xA;    }&#xA;  }&#xA;},&#xA;&quot;dependencies&quot;: {&#xA;  &quot;NETStandard.Library&quot;: &quot;1.0.0-rc3-23909&quot;&#xA;},&#xA;I think, at least, that this is what it is supposed to be. Everything that I expect to be in the standard library to be in the standard library, and the rest I still need to reference. Now we get to the fun part. Using &quot;dotnet restore / dotnet build&quot; it successfully compiles. But using &quot;dnu restore / dnu build&quot; it does not.&#xA;I think that this relates to the magic incantation of the specific nuget feeds that it checks, but I&#x27;m not sure. Not being able to also compile that on DNX means that I can&#x27;t use Visual Studio to actually work on this project.&#xA;And a more complex project just doesn&#x27;t work.&#xA;So I&#x27;m lost, and feeling quite stupid at this point. And more than a bit frustrated.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My new course Applying Functional Principles in C#&#xA0;for Pluralsight went live.&#xA; Applying Functional Principles in C# What interesting about functional programming is that it allows you to adhere to the most important&#xA0;software development principles, just as the DDD practices do. It helps reduce the cognitive load when you deal with your code base and thus keep your software maintainable in a long term.&#xA; This course is based on the article series&#xA0;I posted awhile back.</p>
