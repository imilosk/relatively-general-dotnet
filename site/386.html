            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m not sure that there is a better word to describe it. We have a sign in the office, 3 feet by 6 feet that says: Reduce Friction. And that is something that we tried very hard to do.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Under simplicity we aggregate everything that might aggravate you, and what we did to reduce that.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That include things like reducing the number of files and assemblies we ship. Compare the 2.5 output:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;To the 3.0 output:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We did that by removing a lot of dependencies that we could do without, and internalizing a lot of the other stuff.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We went over the command line interface of the tooling we use and upgraded that. For example, restoring via the command line is now split into a restoring a system database (offline operation for the entire server) or restoring a regular database (the server is fully online, and other databases can run during this time).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In secret and without telling anyone, we have also doubled the amount of parallel work that RavenDB can do. Previously, if you purchased a standard license, you were limited to 6 concurrent index tasks, for example. In RavenDB 3.0, the standard license still has 6 cores capacity, but it will allow up to 12 concurrent index tasks. If you have a 32 cores Enterprise license, that would mean 64 concurrent indexing tasks, and you can follow the logic from there, I asuume.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We have also dropped the Raven.Client.Embedded assembly. It isn&#x2019;t necessary. The full functionality is still available, of course, it was just moved to Raven.Database assembly. That reduce the amount of dlls that you have to work with and manage.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You probably don&#x2019;t care much, but we have done a lot of refactoring on the internals of RavenDB. The DocumentDatabase class (the core functionality in RavenDB) was broken up into many separate classes, and on the client side, we have done much the same to the DocumentStore class. We have also combined several listeners together, so now you don&#x2019;t have to deal with Extended Conversion Listeners.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In terms of storage, obviously Voron gives us a huge boost, and it is designed to be a zero admin system that self optimize. But we changed things on top of that as well. Previously, we were storing the data as BSON on disk. That decision had a lot to do with serialization costs and the size on disk. However, that created issues when we had to deal with the storage at a low level. So now RavenDB stores the data in text JSON format all the way through. And yes, it will seamlessly convert from BSON to JSON when you update documents, you don&#x2019;t have to do anything to get it working. We run extensive performance testing here, and it turned out that we were able to reduce the cost of writing by moving to a textual format.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another small annoyance with RavenDB was the use of in memory databases. Those are usually used for testing, but we also have a number of clients that use those for production data, usually as a high throughput first responder, with replication to / from backend systems to ensure durability. Previously, you had to manually tell RavenDB that it shouldn&#x2019;t tear down those database when they went idle. Now we won&#x2019;t tear down an in memory database even if it didn&#x2019;t do anything for a long while.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another common issues was people adding / removing bundles on the fly. This isn&#x2019;t supported, and it can cause issues because it usually works, but not always. We made it so the process for doing that is a bit more involved, and require an actual acknowledgment that you are doing something that might be unsafe.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Users sometimes have proxies / man in the middle service that manipulate the HTTP headers. A common example of that is New Relic. That can cause problems sometimes, since RavenDB use HTTP headers to pass the document metadata, that caused issues. By now, we have pretty much filtered out all the common stuff, but since that always required us to make a new release, that had a prohibitive cost of the users. Instead, we now allow you to customize the list of headers that the server will ignore on the fly.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We did a lot for indexes in 3.0, but one of the changes is both simple and meaningful. We gave you the ability to ask if my current index definition matches the one on the server? That is important during deployments, because you can check if an index is up to date or not, and then decide if you need to do an online index rebuild, or schedule this for a later time, with less load, or just move on because everything is the same.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In RavenDB 3.0, we have deprecated the attachments, they still work (but will be removed in the next major release), but you are expected to use RavenFS for binary storage. RavenDB now comes with a migration tool to move all attachments from a RavenDB database to a RavenFS file system.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;As I said, those are small things, none of them would rise to the level of major feature on its own. In aggregate (and I mentioned just the top from a very big list) they represent a significant reduction in the amount of friction that you have to deal with when using RavenDB.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB has always been accessible from other platforms. We have users using RavenDB from Python and Node.JS, we also have users using Ruby &amp; PHP, although there isn&#x2019;t a publicly available resource for that.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;With RaenDB 3.0, we release an official Java Client API for RavenDB. Using it is pretty simple if you are familiar with the RavenDB API or the Hibernate API.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We start by creating the document store:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;IDocumentStore store = new DocumentStore(ravenDbUrl, &quot;todo-db&quot;);&#xA;store.initialize();&#xA;store.executeIndex(new TodoByTitleIndex());&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Note that we have an compiled index as well here, which looks like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;public class TodoByTitleIndex extends AbstractIndexCreationTask {&#xA;&#xA;    public TodoByTitleIndex() {&#xA;        map = &quot;from t in docs.todos select new { t.Title, t.CreationDate } &quot;;&#xA;        QTodo t = QTodo.todo;&#xA;        index(t.title, FieldIndexing.ANALYZED);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Since Java doesn&#x2019;t have Linq, we use the Querydsl to handle that. The index syntax is still Linq on the server side, though.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That is enough about setup, let us see how we can actually work with this. Here is us doing a search:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;@Override&#xA;protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {&#xA;&#xA;    ServletContext context = request.getSession().getServletContext();&#xA;    IDocumentStore store = (IDocumentStore) context.getAttribute(ContextManager.DOCUMENT_STORE);&#xA;&#xA;    String searchText = request.getParameter(&quot;search&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;    try (IDocumentSession session = store.openSession()) {&#xA;        QTodo t = QTodo.todo;&#xA;&#xA;        IRavenQueryable&lt;Todo&gt; query = session.query(Todo.class, TodoByTitleIndex.class)&#xA;            .orderBy(t.creationDate.asc());&#xA;&#xA;        if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(searchText)) {&#xA;            query = query.where(t.title.eq(searchText));&#xA;        }&#xA;&#xA;        List&lt;Todo&gt; todosList = query.toList();&#xA;&#xA;        response.getWriter().write(RavenJArray.fromObject(todosList).toString());&#xA;        response.getWriter().close();&#xA;&#xA;    } catch (Exception e) {&#xA;        throw new RuntimeException(e);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Basically, we get the store from the context, and then open a session. You can see the fluent query API, and how we work with sessions.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;A more interesting example, albeit simpler, is how we write:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;@Override&#xA;protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException,&#xA;    IOException {&#xA;    ServletContext context = request.getSession().getServletContext();&#xA;    IDocumentStore store = (IDocumentStore) context.getAttribute(ContextManager.DOCUMENT_STORE);&#xA;&#xA;    try (IDocumentSession session = store.openSession()) {&#xA;        Todo todo = new Todo(request.getParameter(&quot;title&quot;));&#xA;        session.store(todo);&#xA;        session.saveChanges();&#xA;&#xA;    } catch (Exception e) {&#xA;        throw new RuntimeException(e);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This API should be instantly familiar for any RavenDB or Hibernate users. As for the actual entity definition, here it goes:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;@QueryEntity&#xA;public class Todo {&#xA;&#xA;    private Boolean completed;&#xA;    private Date creationDate;&#xA;    private Integer id;&#xA;    private String title;&#xA;&#xA;    public Todo() {&#xA;        super();&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public Todo(final String title) {&#xA;        super();&#xA;        this.title = title;&#xA;        this.creationDate = new Date(System.currentTimeMillis());&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public Boolean getCompleted() {&#xA;        return completed;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public Date getCreationDate() {&#xA;        return creationDate;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public Integer getId() {&#xA;        return id;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public String getTitle() {&#xA;        return title;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public void setCompleted(Boolean completed) {&#xA;        this.completed = completed;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public void setCreationDate(Date creationDate) {&#xA;        this.creationDate = creationDate;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public void setId(Integer id) {&#xA;        this.id = id;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public void setTitle(String title) {&#xA;        this.title = title;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    @Override&#xA;    public String toString() {&#xA;        return &quot;Todo [title=&quot; &#x2B; title &#x2B; &quot;, completed =&quot; &#x2B; completed &#x2B; &quot;, creationDate=&quot; &#x2B; creationDate &#x2B; &quot;, id=&quot; &#x2B; id&#xA;            &#x2B; &quot;]&quot;;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Except for the @QueryEntity annotation, it is a plain old Java class.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And of course, I&#x2019;m using the term Java Client API, but this is actually available for any JVM language. Including Groovy, Scala and Clojure*.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;* There is actually a dedicated RavenDB client for Clojure, written by Mark Woodhall.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">While most of the time, when a user is working with RavenDB, they do so via the browser, developers spend most of their time in code, and when working with RavenDB, that means working with the RavenDB Client API. We have spent quite a bit of time on that as well, as you can imagine. Here are a few of the highlights.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Fully async, all the way through. Communication with RavenDB is done to a remote server, which means that a lot of time is spent just doing I/O. Recognizing this, we are now taking full advantage of the async API available to us and the entirety of RavenDB 3.0 Client API is async. Previously, we had an async and sync version of the stack, which cause compatibility issues, some stuff worked for sync and not for async, or vice versa. With 3.0, we now has a single code path, and it is all async. For the sync API, we are just wrapping the async API. That gives us a single code path, and a fully async I/O throughout, unless you chose to use the sync API, at which point we&#x2019;ll wait, per your request.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Lazy async is fully supported now. As part of the fully async part, we now have support for lazy operations on the full async session.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Lazy timings. As long as we are speaking lazily, a frequent request was to be able to get the actual time that the lazy request spent on the server side. That was actually interesting, because when we first implemented this feature, we thought we had a bug. The total time for the request was&#xA0;lower than the time for each individual request. Then I realized that we are actually running the requests in parallel inside the server, so that made sense.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Embedded / remote clients unity. Similar to the previous issue, embedded clients had a totally different code path than remote clients. That caused issues because sometimes you had something that would work in embedded but not in remote. And that sucked. We changes things so now everything works through the same (async!) pipeline. That means that you can do async calls on embedded databases, and that as far as RavenDB is concerned, there really is no difference if you are calling me from the same process or remotely.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Admin operation split was done so we won&#x2019;t have a developer accidently try to use an operation that requires admin privileges. Now all of the privilege actions are under the cmds.Admin or cmds.GlobalAdmin properties. That gives you a good indication about the permission levels that you need for an operation. Either you just need access to the database (obvious), or you are a database admin (able to do things such as take backups, start / stop indexing, etc) or you are a server admin, and can create or delete databases, change permissions, etc.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Bulk insert errors are now handled much better, previously we had to wait until the operation would be completed, which could be quite a while. Now we can detect and error on them immediately.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Bulk insert change detection. Users often use bulk insert to manage ETL processes. It is very common to have a nightly process that run over the data and write large portions of it. With 3.0, we have the ability to specify that the data might actually be the same, so the bulk insert process will check, and if the stored value and the new value is the same, the server will skip writing to this document. In this way, we won&#x2019;t have to re-index this document, re-replicate it, etc.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Reduced client side allocations. RavenDB users often run their software for months at a time, that means that anything that we can do to help reduce resource consumption is good. We have changed how we work internally to reduce the number of allocations that we are doing, and in particular to reduce the number of large object heap allocations. This tend to reduce the overall resource cost significantly over time.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;What changes? In RavenDB, you could ask the session if there has been any changes (ie, if a call to SaveChanges() will go to the server), or if a particular entity had changes. Honestly, we added that feature strictly for our own testing, we didn&#x2019;t think it would actually be used. Overtime, we saw that users often had questions in the form of: &#x201C;I loaded the document, made no changes, but it is still saying that it changed!&#x201D; The answer for those questions ranged from: &#x201C;You have a computed Age field that uses the current time to calculate itself&#x201D; to &#x201C;you added/remove a property, and now it needs to be saved.&#x201D; Sometimes it was our change detection code that had a false positive, as well, but any time this happened, that required a support call to resolve. Now, you can call session.Advanced.WhatChanged(), which will give you a dictionary with full details on all the changes that happened in the session.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Missing properties retention. This one is probably the first feature that we developed strictly for 3.0. The issue is what happens when you load a document from the database, but it has extra properties. What do I mean by that? Imagine that we changed our code to remove the FullName property. However, all our documents retain that property. In 2.5, loading and saving the document would overwrite the existing document with the new one, without the property. We got feedback from customers that this wasn&#x2019;t a desirable behavior. Now, even though the FullName property isn&#x2019;t accessible from your model, it will be retained (even if you have made changes to other properties).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Formatted indexes. In 2.5, you usually define indexes using the linq query format, but when you look at them on the server side, they can be&#x2026; quite ugly. We are now using the same index format technique we have server side to prettify the indexes and make sure that they look very similar to the way you define them in code.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;There are other stuff that went into the client, better Linq query support, you can now do includes on the results of MoreLikeThis query, and a lot of other stuff that I just done have the time (and you the patience) to go over them all. Those are the highlights, the things that really stand out.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">That is one scary headline, isn&#x2019;t it? Go into the story and read all about it, there is a plot twist in the end.  This post was written in 05:40 AM, and I have spent the entire night up and awake*. A customer called me in a state of panic, their database is not loading, and anything they tried didn&#x2019;t work. I worked with him for a while on understanding what is going on, and how to try to recover what was going on. Here is the story as I got it from the customer in question, and only embellished a lot to give the proper context for the story.  It all started with a test failure, in fact, it started with all the tests failing. The underlying reason was soon discovered, the test database disk was completely full, not even enough disk space to put half a byte.&#xA0; The customer took a single look at that, and run a search on the hard disk, to find what is taking so much space. The answer was apparent. The logs directory was full, in fact, the Webster dictionary would need to search hard and wide to find a word to express how full it was. So the customer in question did the natural thing, and hit Shift&#x2B;Delete to remove all that useless debug logs that has been cluttering the disk. He then started the server again, and off to the races. Except that there was a slight problem, when trying to actually load the database, the server choked, cried and ended up curled to a fetal position, refusing to cooperate even when a big stick was fetch and waved in its direction. The problem was that the logs files that were deleted were not debug log. Those were the database transaction logs. And removing them from the disk has the effect of causing the database to be unable to recover, so it stopped and refused to work.  Now, remember that this is a test server, which explains why developers and operations guys are expected to do stuff to it. But the question was raised, what actually caused the issue? Can this happen in production as well? If it happens, can we recover from&#xA0; it? And more importantly, how can this be prevented? The underlying reason for the unbounded transaction logs growth was that the test server was an exact clone of the production system. And one of the configuration settings that was defined was &#x201C;enable incremental backups&#x201D;. In order to enable incremental backups, we can&#x2019;t delete old journal files, we have to wait for a backup to actually happen, at which point we can copy the log files elsewhere, then delete them.&#xA0; If you don&#x2019;t backup a database marked with enable incremental backups, it can&#x2019;t free the disk space, and hence, the problem. In production, regular backups are being run, and there were no tx log files being retained. But no one bothered to do any maintenance work on the test server, and the configuration explicitly forbid us from automatically handling this situation.&#xA0; But in a safe-by-default mindset we would do anything for the operations guy to notice it with enough time to do something about it. That&#x2019;s why for 3.0 we are taking a proactive step toward this case, and we will alert when the database is about to run out of free space. Now, for the actual corruption issue. Any database makes certain assumptions, and chief among them is that when you write to disk, and actually flush the data, it isn&#x2019;t going away or being modified behind our back. If that happens, which can be because of disk corruption, manual intervention in the files, stupid anti virus software or just someone randomly deleting files by accident. At that point, all bets are off, and there isn&#x2019;t much that can be done to protect ourselves from this situation. The customer in question? Federico from Corvalius.  Note that this post is pretty dramatized. This is a test server, not a production system, , so the guarantees, expectations and behavior toward them are vastly different. The reason for making such a big brouhaha from what is effectively a case of fat fingers is that I wanted to discuss high availability story with RavenDB. The general recommendation we are moving toward in 3.0 is that any High Availability story in RavenDB has to take the Shared Nothing approach. In effect, this means that you will not using technologies such as Windows Clustering, because that relies on a common shared resource, such as the SAN. Issues there, which actually creep up on you (out of quota space in the SAN can happen very easily) and take down the whole system, even though you spent a lot of time and money on a&#xA0; supposedly highly available solution. A shared nothing approach limit the potential causes for failure by having multiple nodes that can each operate independently. With RavenDB, this is done using Replication, you define a master/master replication between two nodes, and you can run it with one primary node that your servers connect to usually. At that point, any failure in this node would mean automatic switching over to the secondary, with no downtime. You don&#x2019;t have to plan for it, you don&#x2019;t have to configure it, It Just Works. Now, that is almost true, because you need to be aware that in a split brain situation, you might have conflicts, but you can set a default strategy for that (server X is the authoritative source) or a custom conflict resolution policy. The two nodes means that you always have a hot spare, which can also handle scale out scenario by handling some of the load from the primary server if needed.  Beyond replication, we also need to ensure that the data that we have is kept safe. A common request from admins that we heard is that a hot spare is wonderful, but they don&#x2019;t trust that they have a backup if they can&#x2019;t put it on a tape and file it on a shelve somewhere. That also help for issues such as offsite data storage in case you don&#x2019;t have a secondary data center (if you do, put a replicated node there as well). This may sound paranoid, but having an offline backup means that if something did a batch job that was supposed to delete old customers, but deleted all customers, you won&#x2019;t be very happy to realize that this batch delete process was actually replicate to your entire cluster and your customer count is set at zero, and then start declining from there. This is the easy case, a bad case is when you had a bug in your code that wrote bad data over time, you really want to be able to go back to the database as it was two weeks ago, and you can only do that from cold storage. One way to do that is to actually do backups. The problem with doing that is that you usually go for full backups, which means that you might be backing up tens of GB on every backup, and that is very awkward to deal with. Incremental backups are easier to work with, certainly. But when building Highly Available systems, I usually don&#x2019;t bother with full backups. I already have the data in one or two additional locations, after all. I don&#x2019;t care for quick restore at this point, because I can do that on one of the replicated nodes. What I do care is that I have an offsite copy of the data that I can use if I ever need to. Because time to restore isn&#x2019;t a factor, but convenience and management is, I would usually go with the periodic export system. This is how this looks like:  The Q drive is a shared network drive, and we do an incremental export to it every 10 minutes and a full export every 3 days. I am aware that this is pretty paranoid setup, we have multiple nodes holding the data, and exports of the data, sometimes I even have each node export the data independently, for the &#x201C;no data loss, ever&#x201D; Oh, and about Federico&#x2019;s issue? While he was trying to see if he could fix the database in the event such a thing happen in production (in the 3 live replicas at once), he was already replicating to the test sandbox from one of the production live replicas. With big databases it will take time, but a high-availability setup allows it. So even if the data file appears to be corrupted beyond repair, everything is good now. * To be fair, that is because I&#x2019;m actually at the airport waiting for a plane to take me on vacation, but I thought it was funnier to state it this way.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It still feels funny to say that a major feature in a database product is the user interface, but I&#x2019;m feeling a lot less awkward about saying that about the new studio now.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The obvious change here is that it is using HTML5, and not Silverlight. That alone would be great, because Silverlight has gotten pretty annoying, but we have actually done much more that. We moved to HTML5 and we added a lot of new features.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is how this looks like:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Now, let me show you some of the new stuff. None of it is ground breaking on its own, but combined they create a vastly improved experience.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Indexes copy/paste allows you to easily transfer index definitions from one database to another, without requiring any external tools.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Also on indexing, we have the format index feature, which can take a nasty index and turn that into a pretty and more easily understood code:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Speaking of code and indexing, did you notice the C# button there? Clicking on that will give you this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Like the copy/paste index feature, the idea is that you can modify the index on the studio, play with the various options, then you hit this button and you can copy working index creation code into your project and don&#x2019;t worry any more about how you are going to deploy it.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We also added some convenience factors, such as computed columns.&#xA0; Let us see how that works. Here is the default view of the employees in the Northwind database:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;that is nice, but it seems complex to me, all I care about is the full name and the age. So I head to the settings and define a few common functions:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I then head back to the employees collection and click on the grid icon at the header row, which gives me this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;After pressing &#x201C;Save as default&#x201D;, I can see that the values shown for employees are:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You can also do the same for the results of specific queries or indexes, so you&#x2019;ll have better experience looking at the data. The custom functions also serve additional roles, but I&#x2019;ll touch them on a future post.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Speaking of queries, here is how they look like:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Note the Excel icon on the top, you can export the data directly to Excel now. This is common if you need to send it to a colleague or anyone in the business side of things. For that matter, you can also load data into RavenDB from a CSV file:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;There is actually a lot of stuff that goes on in the studio, but I won&#x2019;t talk about it now, replication tracking, better metrics, etc. I&#x2019;ll talk about them in posts specific for the major bundles and a post (or posts) about better operations support.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I&#x2019;ll leave you with one final feature, the map reduce visualizer:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;More posts are coming .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A frequent request from RavenDB users was the ability to store binary data. Be that actual documents (PDF, Word), images (user&#x2019;s photo, accident images, medical scans) or very large items (videos, high resolution aerial photos).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;RavenDB can do that, sort of, with attachments. But attachments were never a first class feature in RavenDB.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;With RavenFS, files now have first class support. Here is a small screen shot, I&#x2019;ve a detailed description of how it works below.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The Raven File System exposes a set of files, which are binary data with a specific key. However, unlike a simple key/value store, RavenFS does much more than just store the binary values.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;It was designed upfront to handle very large files (multiple GBs) efficiently at API and storage layers level. To the point where it can find common data patterns in distinct files (or even in the same file) and just point to it, instead of storing duplicate information. RavenFS is a replicated and highly available system, updating a file will only send the changes made to the file between the two nodes, not the full file. This lets you update very large files, and only replicate the changes. This works even if you upload the file from scratch, you don&#x2019;t have to deal with that manually.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Files aren&#x2019;t just binary data. Files have metadata associated with them, and that metadata is available for searching. If you want to find all of Joe&#x2019;s photos from May 2014, you can do that easily. The client API was carefully structured to give you full functionality even when sitting in a backend server, you can stream a value from one end of the system to the other without having to do any buffering.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Let us see how this works from the client side, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;var fileStore = new FilesStore()&#xA;{&#xA;    Url = &quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;,&#xA;    DefaultFileSystem = &quot;Northwind-Assets&quot;,&#xA;};&#xA;&#xA;using(var fileSession = fileStore.OpenAsyncSession())&#xA;{&#xA;    var stream = File.OpenRead(&quot;profile.png&quot;);&#xA;    var metadata = new RavenJObject&#xA;    {&#xA;        {&quot;User&quot;, &quot;users/1345&quot;},&#xA;        {&quot;Formal&quot;: true}&#xA;    };&#xA;    fileSession.RegisterUpload(&quot;images/profile.png&quot;, stream, metadata);&#xA;    await fileSession.SaveChangesAsync(); // actually upload the file&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;using(var fileSession = fileStore.OpenAsyncSession())&#xA;{&#xA;    var file = await session.Query()&#xA;                    .WhereEquals(&quot;Formal&quot;, true)&#xA;                    .FirstOrDefaultAsync();&#xA;&#xA;    var stream = await session.DownloadAsync(file.Name);&#xA;&#xA;    var file = File.Create(&quot;profile.png&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;    await stream.CopyToAsync(file);&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;First of all, you start by creating a FileStore, similar to RavenDB&#x2019;s DocumentStore, and then create a session. RavenFS is fully async, and we don&#x2019;t provide any sync API. The common scenario is using for large files, where blocking operations are simply not going cut it.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Now, we upload a file to the server, note that at no point do we need to actually have the file in memory. We open a stream to the file, and register that stream to be uploaded. Only when we call SaveChangesAsync will we actually read from that stream and write to the file store. You can also see that we are specifying metadata on the file. Later, we are going to be searching on that metadata. The results of the search is a FileHeader object, which is useful if you want to show the user a list of matching files. To actually get the contents of the file, you call DownloadAsync. Here, again, we don&#x2019;t load the entire file to memory, but rather will give you a stream for the contents of the file that you can send to its final destination.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Pretty simple, and highly efficient process, overall.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;RavenFS also has all the usual facilities you need from a data storage system, including full &amp; incremental backups, full replication and high availability features. And while it has the usual file system folder model, to encourage familiarity, the most common usage is actually as a metadata driven system, where you locate a desired file based searching.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you have been following this blog at all, you must have heard quite a lot about Voron. If you haven&#x2019;t been paying attention, you can watch my talk about it at length, or you can get the executive summary below.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The executive summary is that Voron is a high performance low level&#xA0; transactional storage engine, which was written from scratch by Hibernating Rhinos with the intent to move most / all of our infrastructure to it. RavenDB 3.0 can run on either Voron or Esent, and show comparable performance using either one.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;More importantly, because Voron was created by us, this means that we can do more with it, optimize it exactly to our own needs and requirements. And yes, one of those would be running on Linux machines.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But more important, having Voron also allows us to create dedicated database solutions much more easily. One of those is RavenFS, obviously, but we have additional offering that are just waiting to get out and blow you minds away.</p>
