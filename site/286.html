            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The nightmare scenario for a database vendor is something like this: Over 27,000 databases managed by MongoDB held to ransom; 99,000 still vulnerable. To be fair, this isn&#x2019;t quite the nightmare scenario. The nightmare scenario would be if this would be due to some vulnerability in the database, but in this case, this isn&#x2019;t that at all. It is simply that admins have setup a publicly visible database with no permissions on the internet, and said &#x201C;okay, we are done, what is the next ticket?&#x201D;. Now, I presume that it didn&#x2019;t really went on like that, but the problem is that if you follow the proper instructions, you are fine, by default, all your data is exposed over the network. I&#x2019;m assuming that a few of those were setup by a proper dev ops team, and mostly they were done by &#x201C;Joe, we are going to prod, here are the server credentials, make sure that the db is running there&#x201D;.&#xA0; Or, also likely, &#x201C;We are done with dev, we can just use the same servers for prod&#x201D;, with no one going in and setting them up properly. You should note that this isn&#x2019;t really about MongoDB specifically (although this is the one that has the most noise at the moment). This makes for a pretty sad reading, you literally require nothing to do to &#x201C;hack&#x201D; into production systems, and access over 600 TB of data (just for MongoDB). The scary thing is that you have questions like this: bind_ip = 127.0.0.1 does not work but 0.0.0.0 works. So the user will actively try to fight any measure you have to protect them.  With RavenDB, we have actually made it a startup error (the server will abort) if you are running a production instance (identified with a license) but you don&#x2019;t require authentication. Now, there are scenarios where this is valid, such as running on a secured network, but they are pretty far, so you have a configuration option that you can set that will enable this scenario, but that require an explicit step and hopefully get the user thinking. With RavenDB 4.0, we&#x2019;ll require authentication (or explicit configuration override) whenever a user ask us to bind to an interface other than localhost.  I think that is one case where you have to reverse &#x201C;let&#x2019;s make it easy to use us&#x201D; and also consider putting hurdles to actually get it running. Because in the long run, getting this wrong means that it is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Before getting to grips with a distributed gossip system in Rust, I decided that it would be better to look at something a bit more challenging, but smaller in scope. I decided to implement the low level trie challenge in Rust. This is interesting, because it is complex enough problem to require thinking even for experienced developers, but at the same time, it isn&#x2019;t complex, just have a lot of details. It also require us to do a lot of lot level stuff and manipulate memory directly, so that is something that would be an interesting test for a system level programming language. On the one hand, even with just a few hours with Rust, I can see some elegance coming out of certain pieces.&#xA0; For example, take a look at the following code: &#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.&#xA;      Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;              Show hidden characters&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          fn find_node(self: &amp;Trie, key: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;NodeAndParent, TrieErrors&gt; {&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              let header = self.trie_header();&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              if header.items == 0 {&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;                  return Err(TrieErrors::ValNotFound);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              }&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              let node = self.node_header(mem::size_of::&lt;TrieHeader&gt;() as isize);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              match node.find_match(None, 0, key) {&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;                  Err(NodeErrors::ValNotFound) | &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;                  Err(NodeErrors::PartialMatch{ closest: _}) &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;                                      =&gt; Err(TrieErrors::ValNotFound),&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;                  Ok(matching_node)   =&gt; Ok(matching_node)&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              }&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          }&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          nested-error-handling.rs&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA; This is responsible for searching on the trie for a value, and I like that the find_match function traverse the tree and allow me to return both an enum value and a the closest match to this when it fails (so I can continue the process directly from there). On the other hand, we have pieces of code like this:  And any line that has four casts in it is already suspect. And as I&#x2019;m dealing with the raw memory, I have quite a bit of this.

It fails to compile:  I have a method that takes a mutable MyTrie reference, and pass it to a method that expects a immutable reference. This is fine, and would work. But I need to use the value from the find method in the delete_internal method, which again needs a mutable instance. But this fails with:  error[E0502]: cannot borrow `*self` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable I understand the problem, but I am not really sure how to solve it. The problem is that I kinda want the find method to remain immutable, since it is also used on the read method, which can run on immutable instances.Technically speaking, I could copy the values that I want out of the node reference and do a lexical scope that would force the immutable borrow to end, but I&#x2019;m unsure yet what would be the best option. It seems like a lot of work to get what I want in spite, and not with the help of, the compiler.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The previous post generated some great discussion, and we have done a bit of research in the meantime about what is going to be required in order to provide strong encryption support in RavenDB.  Note: I&#x2019;m still no encryption expert. I&#x2019;m basing a lot of what I have here on reading libsodium code and docs.  The same design goals that we had before still hold. We want to encrypt the data at the page level, but it looks like it is going to be impossible to just encrypt the whole page. The reason behind that is that encryption is actual a pure mathematical operation, and given the same input text and the same key, it is always going to generate the same value. Using that, you can create certain attacks on the data by exploiting the sameness of the data, even if you don&#x2019;t actually know what it is. In order to prevent that, you would use an initialization vector or nonce (seems to be pretty similar, with the details about them being relevant only with regards to the randomness requirements they have). At any rate, while I initially hoped that I can just use a fixed value per page, that is a big &#x201C;nope, don&#x2019;t do that&#x201D;. So we need some place to store that information. Another thing that I run into is the problem with modifying the encrypted text in order to generate data that can be successfully decrypted but is different from the original plain text. A nice example of that can be seen here (see the section: How to Attack Unauthenticated Encryption). So we probably want to have that as well.  This is not possible with the current Voron format. Luckily, one of the reasons we built Voron is so we can get it to do what we want. Here is what a Voron page will look after this change:  Voron page: 8 KB in size, 64 bytes header&#xA;&#x2B;-------------------------------------------------------------------------&#x2B;&#xA;|Page # 64 bits|Page metadata up to 288 bits  |mac 128 bits| nonce 96 bits|&#xA;&#x2B;-------------------------------------------------------------------------&#x2B;&#xA;|                                                                         |&#xA;|  Encrypted page information                                             |&#xA;|                                                                         |&#xA;|       8,128 bytes                                                       |&#xA;|                                                                         |&#xA;|                                                                         |&#xA;&#x2B;-------------------------------------------------------------------------&#x2B;&#xA;The idea is that when we need to encrypt a page, we&#x2019;ll do the following:&#xA;&#xA;First time we need to encrypt the page, we&#x2019;ll generate a random nonce. Each time that we encrypt the page, we&#x2019;ll increment the nonce. &#xA;We&#x2019;ll encrypt the page information and put it in the page data section&#xA;As well as encrypting the data, we&#x2019;ll also sign both it and the rest of the page header, and place that in the mac field.&#xA;The idea is that modifying either the encrypted information or the page metadata will generate an error because the tampering will be detected.&#xA;This is pretty much it as far as the design of the actual data encryption goes. But there is more to it. &#xA;Voron uses a memory mapped file to store the information (actually, several, with pretty complex interactions, but it doesn&#x2019;t matter right now). That means that if we want to decrypt the data, we probably shouldn&#x2019;t be doing that on the memory mapped file memory. Instead, each transaction is going to set aside some memory of its own, and when it needs to access a page, it will be decrypted from the mmap file into that transaction private copy. During the transaction run, the information will be available in plain text mode for that transaction. When the transaction is over, that memory is going to be zeroed. Note that transactions RavenDB tend to be fairly short term affairs. Because of that, each read transaction is going to get a small buffer to work with and if there are more pages accessed than allowed, it will replace the least recently used page with another one. &#xA;That leaves us with the problem of the encryption key. One option would be to encrypt all pages within the database with the same key, and use the randomly generated nonce per page and then just increment that. However, that does leave us with the option that two pages will be encrypted using the same key/nonce. That has a low probability, but it should be considered. We can try deriving a new key per page from the master page, but that seems&#x2026; excessive. But it looks like there is another option is to generate use a block chipper, where we pass different block counter for each page. &#xA;This would require a minimal change to crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_encrypt_detached, allowing to pass a block counter externally, rather than have it as a constant. I asked the question with more details so I can have a more authoritative answer about that. If this isn&#x2019;t valid, we&#x2019;ll probably use a nonce that is composed of the page # and the number of changes that the page has went through. This would limit us to about 2^32 modifications on the same page, though. We could limit the a single database file size to mere 0.5 Exabyte rather than 128 Zettabyte, but somehow I think we can live with it.&#xA;This just leave us with the details of key management. On Windows, this is fairly easy. We can use the CryptProtectData / CryptUnprotectData to protect the key. A transaction will start by getting the key, doing its work, then zeroing all the pages it touched (and decrypted) and its key. This way, if there are no active transactions, there is no plaintext key in memory. On Linux, we can apparently use Libsecret to do this. Although it seems like it has a much higher cost to do so.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently got a comment that included this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x2026;this &quot;Making code faster&quot; series is pretty useless for the average developer working on the usual application.&#xA;&#xA;And I couldn&#x2019;t disagree more.&#xA;Now, to be fair, the kind of challenges that we have to deal with while building high performance database engine are quite different than the kind of challenges that a typical enterprise developer has to deal with. That isn&#x2019;t quite true, we have the studio, which behaves very much like an application, but you&#x2019;ll rarely see me talking about the JavaScript aspects of building the RavenDB Studio. I&#x2019;ll just say that from my perspective, this post summarize my feelings about modern JavaScript dev.&#xA;But back to the topic, the average developer is a mythical beast., who apparently have very little time to look around from coding yet another login page that have to be delivered now. I have had several such discussions about this in the past. And I think that this post summarize the opposing view, pretty much saying that is offesnive to expect someone to have the time to improve themselves.&#xA;My thinking is that if you value your&#xA0;career, you need to contiously put it in effort to actually improve and extend themselves, period. And that isn&#x27;t to say that this is easy.&#xA;Here is the deal, if you are only interested in what you can bring you immediate value (the hottest JS libraries, or some design pattern that you need to use tomorrow), you are doing yourself a disservice. In order to be good, you need to continuously invest in learning new stuff. And you need to do it in such as way that you aren&#x2019;t continuously learning the same stuff over and over again (no, learning WebForms, MVC 1, MVC 2 &#x2026; MVC 5, MVC Core doesn&#x2019;t count).&#xA;Quite a bit of this isn&#x2019;t really going to be useful in the near future, but expanding your knowledge base is going to be useful in the long term. You are going to run into things and go &#x201C;Ah! I know that already&#x201D;, or be able to provide much better solutions then the stuff that have already been tried.&#xA;Yes, that actually take both work and effort. You need to make time to do so, and when you have family and kids that isn&#x2019;t easy. But it is worth it.&#xA;And just because I know people are going to read it as such, that does&#xA0;not&#xA0;mean that you&#x27;ve got to abandon the kids to raise themselves while you are hacking away at your latest interest. For most people, putting in two to four hours a week is possible. Feel free to cut down the time you are browsing Facebook, for example.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have an idea for a relatively large Rust project, but I want to get up to speed on the language first. So I decided to write a simple Echo server. In other words, listen to the network, and just echo back what the user is sending us. Simple and relatively trivial, but also involve enough moving pieces that it isn&#x2019;t hello world.

One thing to note, the Windows telnet takes several seconds to connect, which made me think that my code is somehow slow, using telnet on Linux gives instant response. There are a couple of things to note here.  On lines 7 and 9-10 you can see me using expect. This is effectively a way to say &#x201C;if this returns an error, kill the program with this message&#x201D;. This is an interestingly named method (read, I think it is backward), which I think is suitable for the high level portions of your code, but you shouldn&#x2019;t probably use it in anything that doesn&#x2019;t have full control over the environment. On line 14, we start to listen to the network, accepting connections. On each accepted connection, we spin a new thread and then pass it the new connection. I actually expected that passing the connection to the thread would be harder (or at least require a move), I&#x2019;m not sure why it worked. I&#x2019;m guessing that this is because the stream we got is the result of the iteration, and we already took ownership on that value? The rest happens on line 26, in the handle_client method (incidentally, the Rust compiler will complain if you don&#x2019;t match the expected naming conventions, which is a good way to ensure that you have consistent experience). You might note that I have an issue with error handling here. Rust&#x2019;s methods return a Result struct, and that requires unpacking it. In the first case, line 28, we just assume that it isn&#x2019;t even a valid connection, but in the second, we actually handle it via nested ifs. As I understand it, it might be done with composing this, but I tried using and_then, or_else, map and map_error and wasn&#x2019;t really able to come up with something that would actually work. My next challenge, let us avoid taking a thread per connection and do async I/O. It looks like we can do something similar to TPL as well as an event loop.</p>

Because the previous time I did something like that I looked at Go, which is nice, but except for green threads (which I&#x2019;m familiar with from Erlang), it is pretty much the same old thing. I&#x2019;ll admit that the compilation speeds are pretty attractive there, but I&#x2019;m working mostly on system software this days, and it seems like it is almost there, but not quite. So the choice was between Rust and modern C&#x2B;&#x2B;. The last time I actually did any C&#x2B;&#x2B; professionally was in 2006, I needed to build a tool to make a machine join the domain automatically, or something like that. I remember being stuck for an embarrassing long time on &#x201C;using std&#x201D; vs &#x201C;using namespace std&#x201D;. Before that, I actually did C&#x2B;&#x2B; for a few years, in 1999- 2002 or so. I was below average, at best, but I had read all the Myers books, and I had great confidence that I can mess up real well. But C&#x2B;&#x2B; today is a wildly different beast, much nicer, but at the same time&#x2026; The core concepts (memory management, RAII, etc) I already know, and a lot of the rest seems like stuff that I now take for granted (foreach, auto,lambdas, not doing manual memory management all the time, etc). Looking into modern C&#x2B;&#x2B; codebase and discussion, I see a lot of stuff about move constructors and variadic templates. That caused me some pain, but basically, there isn&#x2019;t anything new there for me, just detail work.  Rust is new, in the sense that it has the Burrow checker and it is supposed to be a safe &amp; fast system programming language. That seems like a big contradiction in term, but it is at least interesting.  So I set out to read the Rust book. I have done so, and below you can see some of my impressions while reading it.  This post is written before I did anything more interesting than writing a hello world.  Rust has macros, and I like that. Should be interesting to see what it can do.&#xA0; Okay, I saw what it can do, and I sort of want to go back to variadic templates. To be rather more exact, that syntax looks sort of the same. And remind me strongly of trying to grok XSLT in the 90s. I like that it has explicit threading support, and it is interesting that this is baked directly into the language and checked by the compiler. Although some of the stuff that is mentioned there is fishy (Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt; and other strangeness), but then again, I&#x2019;ve literally just read the book, so need to see how this work out in practice. Something that was really strange during the reading is that Rust uses the type of the assignment to infer types. &#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

In comparison, it seems like Rust have a lot of stuff going on. Most of it seems to be optional / inferred, but that is surprising. Loop labels and named break / continue are really nice. They are always ugly when you need them. And obviously the type system is quite sophisticated. I&#x2019;m going to see how hard it is going to hurt me when I try writing actually stuff with it.</p>
