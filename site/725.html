            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Recently there have been a few&#xA0;posts about people who... misrepresent themselves when it comes to knowledge and authority. A common question that came up in the comments of those posts was to specify who the guilty party is, if not by name, then a description. &#xA0;First, I want to be clear about the separation I am making. I am seeing a lot of bad code, and I posted some choice tidbits here in the past. Some of it is inexcusable in a software professional, some of it is valid, because the author is not a developer. I don&#x27;t have any issue with bad code coming from people who are not developers (but if you call yourself an architect, and you can&#x27;t code, get thyself away and ponder your sin). I can either work with them to make sure that they will be developers, or limit the amount of work they need to do on the system. What drives me into sputtering rages is seeing so called professional developers and architects who couldn&#x27;t find a clue if I hit them with it. Some random stories, all by professional developers and architects, to make sure that I am clear about who I am talking with.  Senior Java Architect calls a high level meeting to discuss my &quot;unreasonable behavior&quot;, I am not willing to give him access to the application database. My objection to the needless coupling is &quot;unreasonable, and there is not other way to do it&quot;. My suggestion that I&#x27;ll expose a web service that will be called from his application is &quot;obvious impossible&quot; because &quot;java can&#x27;t consume web services from .NET&quot; and anyway &quot;java doesn&#x27;t support web services&quot; The Project Manager whose stated goal is &quot;have very stupid code, we want to hire stupid people, they are cheap&quot; for a business critical application. A team that suggested &quot;hot new tech&quot; that they &quot;have several experts on&quot; that can &quot;make miracles with it&quot; which turns out to be a single guy that read a blog post about it and &quot;really we intend to use this vital project to learn this technology&quot; Senior Developer who designed a three tier system for serving a page. A request arrives, the page puts&#xA0;a message in a queue and then does a synchronous receive from another queue. Another machine that process requests. The message is an SQL statement, with no parameters allowed. There is no concurrency control&#xA0;in the app, so two pages making two totally different requests can get each other&#x27;s results. I couldn&#x27;t follow the reasoning for the decision, but apparently it has something to do with performance. Developer who built the &quot;thread per row&quot; batch process, and actually had a bigger server bought to handle the &quot;big application&quot; that processed &quot;lot of business critical data (15,000 rows)&quot; The Senior Consultant who took the code with him on a USB key whenever he left home, as a &quot;theft precaution&quot; The consulting company who we had to go and fix things after, where all the tables were named &quot;a1&quot; to &quot;a46&quot; and the columns &quot;b5&quot; - &quot;b91&quot;, an explicit design decision to keep them in place. The Expert that had a business buy a 40,000$ BizTalk solution to do copy of one directory to&#xA0;another. We ended up replacing that with a scheduled task that executed: &quot;robocopy \\server\dir \\anotherserver\dir&quot; every 5 minutes. Whoever it was that designed MS CRM I could go on, but this is a good representation of the types, I think. They all have a few things in common, they represent themselves as experts, senior, knowledgeable people. In all those cases, they have actively acted to harm the business they were working for, by action, inaction or misaction. I have no issue with people not knowing any better, but I do expect people that ought to know better to... actually do know better.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Yesterday I reached the breaking point with regards to MS CRM. We needed to push a build to staging, so the customer can start acceptance testing. The way we built it, we have&#xA0;a central CRM development server, and each developer is working mostly locally, but against the same server. I don&#x27;t like it, but the CRM doesn&#x27;t really give me much choice. At any rate, we started the move by trying to move the customizations from the development server to the production server. Naturally, there is no way to diff things, so I have no idea what changed since we last went to production. The import process failed, some SQL error. There is a reason that I use the term &quot;some SQL error&quot;, that is the entire information that I have about this error. checking the event log, trace files, etc reveals no further information. That went beyond annoying. We ended up having to do import of entity by entity, and doesn&#x27;t merge by hand for the entities that failed to import successfully. As you can imagine, that took: (a) time, (b) aggravation.  Both development and production machines has the same version installed, and it is not as if I was trying to do something out of the ordinary, it is supposed to be a common operation.  I had enough with this in lapsus alumni platform. I officially declare it as a nightmare platform.  MS CRM - don&#x27;t bother even trying, you will thank me for it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Gary has a post that talks about something that I have been thinking about for a while. Platforms, defined as applications that you extend, must have source control built in. That is not an optional feature, that is a Must Have. I am working on such a system now, and the amount of effort that it took to get to the point where I can have sort-of seamless source control means that I am not going to work with the product again, period. I am toying with the idea of an enterprise platform that does hurt, that is possible to maintain and actually work with a smile with.  Enterprise, not enterprisey.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Consider this little tidbit: MockRepository mocks = new MockRepository();&#xA;ICustomer customer = mocks.CreateMock&lt;ICustomer&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;using (mocks.Record())&#xA;using (mocks.Ordered())&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;Expect.Call(customer.Id).Return(0);&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;customer.IsPreferred = true;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;using (mocks.Playback())&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;customer.IsPreferred = true;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;What would you expect would be the result of this code? Well, it should obviously fail, right? And probably give a message to the effect of unordered method call. Well, it does fail, but it gives the usual message, not talking about ordered method calls at all. &#xA;The error message is misleading, what was going on?&#xA;I wonder if I am going to bore someone with this description, but what the hell, you can always skip ahead.&#xA;Rhino Mocks records all expectations in a recorder. This recorder can be nested. Rhino Mocks has two of those, the Unordered Recorder and the Ordered Recorder. The ability to nest recorders is fairly interesting part of Rhino Mocks, and was a lot of fun to write correctly. It also means that you have a lot of freedom in how you write the tests, because you can specify with great granularity how things are working. (Grouping methods that should run together, for instance.)&#xA;But, Rhino Mocks only read from one recorder at a time. Let us talk about a concrete example, shall we? In the above code, here is the recorder structure that we have set up:&#xA; Now, why is this important?&#xA;Let us consider how Rhino Mocks will try to resolve a method call. &#xA;First, Rhino Mocks will ask the root recorder if it has an expectation that match the method call. The recorder then checks against the recordedActions list.&#xA;The recorded actions list contains both normal expectations and nested recorders. When a recorder encounters a nested recorder, it enquire whatever this expectation is valid for the recorder. The nested recorder can say that it isn&#x27;t, at which point the parent recorder needs to decide what to do. In the unordered recorder case, it will simple move to the next expectation or recorder, but in the ordered recorder case, it will throw an exception because of the unordered method &#xA;Here is where it starts to get interesting. Let us look at the playback part of the code above. We call customer.IsPreffered(true);&#xA;Rhino Mocks then asks the root recorder whatever this is a valid expectation. The root recorder scans its recorded actions list, which means that it finds the ordered recorder, and then it enquire whatever this is an expected operation.&#xA;Well, is customer.set_IsPreffered an expected method call? &#xA;No, it is not. The expected (ordered) method call for the ordered recorder is the customer.Id call, so the ordered recorder will answer that this is not an expected call. The root recorder now proceeds to check the rest of the recorded actions list, which is empty, so it finds that we have gotten a completely unknown method, and therefor it throws an exception. But since it is the default, unordered, recorder that throws, we get the unordered version of the exception, not the ordered one, which we have probably been expecting to see.&#xA;This is unexpected behavior, but it is precisely how it should behave.&#xA;Nevertheless, it violates the rule of least surprise, and this entire post is now mostly irrelevant, because I have just committed a change to Rhino Mocks that ensures that recorders that only contains a single nested recorder are merged with that recorder, which makes it behave in a way that is more in line with the expected behavior.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Colin Jack has brought up the question of generic entities, which is something that I consider fairly odd use case. Generics are very useful, but not in the final entity layer (they are very useful as layer super type, though). First, let us understand what I am are talking about when I am thinking about generic entities:   The generic entity that you see is ContactInformation&lt;TContactInfoType&gt;, and we want to use several specialized versions of that in our application. In this case, we have contact that can be either a string or a user. Here is an interesting tidbit, NHibernate supports this, here it the required configuration: &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;&#xA;&lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns=&quot;urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   assembly=&quot;Blog&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   namespace=&quot;MyBlog&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;class name=&quot;ContactInformation`1[System.String]&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   table=&quot;ContactInformation_String&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/id&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;property name=&quot;Contact&quot; type=&quot;System.String&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;/class&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;class name=&quot;ContactInformation`1[MyBlog.User]&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9; table=&quot;ContactInformation_User&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/id&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;many-to-one name=&quot;Contact&quot; class=&quot;MyBlog.User, Blog&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;/class&gt;&#xA;&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;&#xA;We can even do different associations to different classes, simple column for string, FK for user. &#xA;What we can&#x27;t do is to map ContactInformation&lt;TContactInfoType&gt;, for the very simple reason that we have no way of doing it. Consider the example above, in one case, we are using a FK, in the other, a simple column. NHibernate has no way of guessing, and since I can&#x27;t really think of a good reason to want to start mapping random values to my database, I think that NHibernate is doing a good thing by insisting that you tell it about how you want this mapped.&#xA;There may be a problem with querying this with HQL, but I think this can be gotten around to with importing the class name to an alias.&#xA;Now, let us get back to the diagram below, by show of hand (well, comments), how many of you think that this is a good way to design your entities?&#xA;An entity is not a list, to which you shove random data. It has a meaning in the domain, and it has a table in which you put the data, and you want to query it, etc. It would take some pretty peculiar use case to convince me that there isn&#x27;t a really simplifying factor here by simply introducing SimpleContactInformation and UserContactInformation classes, which would simple derived from the generic class with the appropriate parameters. The ability to use generics is nice to cut duplicate code, but it also obstruct the clarity of the code, so I see this as significant added value.&#xA;In short, it is possible, but don&#x27;t do it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Names should be in ASCII and are limited to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Anything else, is a heretic attempt to cause me, personally, problems.So speaks the guy who had to convince a company that building a platform on Hebrew# is not a good idea. In addition to that, those names should be in English, consistently spelled and have a uniform coding style. I don&#x27;t care what, just that it is consistent and uniform. Nevertheless, Hungarian notation should be left to those who dreams of the coup of the pwsz and its friend, cbSize. Transcripting variables names is also a sin, and it punishable by crucifixion at your social reform site of choice.  Using names (subject to the above mentioned char limits) from latin-script based languages is allowed, assuming that the work is completely local. Sorry, but I rarely can help with code that looks like:  ILympho loco = new Alieniloquium(); If the developer speaks more than one language, though, a single language should be used across the entire code base. To do otherwise is to court disaster. Again, I can&#x27;t really understand code that goes like this:  Employee divka = Employees.GetByMispar(15); Those are the things that I have found useful.&#xA0; The above applies to types, members, variables, parameters, tables, columns and file names.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, I haven&#x27;t wrote anything about that in a while, and I am scanning the change log right now, and it looks like a lot have been going on. Fabio Maulo has been going at it with gusto, and has ported several very big features, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for that. Karl Chu has been doing some really nice things as well, and deserve thanks as well. Awesome work, both of you. Me, I am sitting in the corner with slack jaw and watching the feature pile on top of each other. This is a partial list only, mind you, I am going over the log, but it contains over three hundred commits, and I am not that patient. I also put things here that I consider significant, which may means that I am missing some things that are important to others. New &amp; Exciting features:  CriteriaTransformer - allows to clone and transform ICriteria and DetachedCriteria. Criteria inspection - improved the ability to see what it going on there, previously was write only. Multi Criteria - the companion to Multi Query &lt;join&gt; tables - allowing to compose a single&#xA0;entity from several tables. Events, Actions and Listeners - this is a very big feature, and it extends the way you can work with NHibernate in very deep ways. Think of it like the interceptor&#x2B;&#x2B;. Persistence Context - this is important for the internal NHibernate structure, it makes it much close to the Hibernate one, which in turn make it easier to share features. list-index - adding the ability to specify the base index of a list, instead of always going from 0 property-ref - allow to have an association that is not based on the primary key on an entity Stateless Session - easier way to work with bulk data, without needing the first level cache Cache Mode - better control on how the session will work with the second level cache. Statistics feature - useful for tests, and to see exactly what NHibernate is doing. Query plan - NHibernate will parse named queries&#xA0;in advance, which allows to do nice things, like provide tool support for them, beyond the perf implications Update IInterceptor - now supports H3.2 methods and capabilities &lt;union-subclass&gt; - like &lt;join-subclass&gt;, but with union instead of joins Other changes:  Bug fixes Using more .Net 2.0 features, generic collections throughout, etc. CLS Compliant refactoring Changing the internal processing of the XML processing to use a more easy to use serialized classes Single consistent configuration schema, for both app.config and hibernate.cfg.xml Updated NHibernate&#x27;s proxies to use Castle&#x27;s RC3 Again, this is partial list only, and I am covering the last 4 months only, but I am very pleased with what we have even so far...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Scott Bellware is talking about Gloryhounds:   Gloryhounds are often already visible members of the community.&#xA0; Upon achieving a certain level of authority in their particular specialization, and a sufficient level of visibility, they rally to an impending new technology release, and work with the benefactor to bring a semblance of impartial evangelism to the community while the benefactor provides the Gloryhound with opportunities that bolster his status through promotional engagements supporting the new technology. Scott has a decidedly... un-commercial streak, which I can both appreciate and disagree with. I appreciate it because I have been flat out lied to by people that had commercial interest in technological decisions, and I disagree because I don&#x27;t think in advance that anything commercial is suspect by default. Ben Scheirman&#xA0;then asks:  Is it wrong that I&#x27;m excited about ASP.NET MVC? &#xA0;Should people not listen to me &quot;preach&quot; it because I didn&#x27;t invent Rails, MonoRail, Django &amp; others? No, it is not, period. However, getting excited about it without ever going out and learning about the rest is a bad idea in many ways. Deciding that this is the true path, so decreed by [vendor] is almost always a bad decision. Making the decision that this product or approach is the best out there because you have tried a significant portion of them is almost always a good decision. Some people thinks that NHibernate is problematic, because it doesn&#x27;t comes with VS integration and drag &amp; drop. I disagree, and I see a lot more value in the flexibility that I get from the approach that NH has chosen.&#xA0;That means that if you want to argue OR/M with me you should have experience in building applications that relies on OR/Ms.&#xA0; If one would want to argue, &quot;I just saw an EF demo, and the designer is great, so it is the best thing out there&quot; I am going to label that guy as uninformed. No, demo applications are not good enough. You need a real project or two to get things rolling, you need to bang your head against a technology. You need to code in anger and swear eternal vengeance against&#xA0;the authors&#x27; ancestors&#xA0;&#xA0;nine generations backs and three forward.  In other words, if your use of the tool has never cracked it around the edges, you haven&#x27;t done enough to really tell how it is going to be. After you have done that, you should also look at the other tools, not to the same level, but to a degree where you are familiar with them enough to discuss their pros and cons from a knowledgeable position.  Then, I think that you are capable of being a &quot;recognized leader in the problem space&quot;, as Scott so eloquently puts it For myself, I read Java, Rails and Erlang books occasionally, just to make sure that I don&#x27;t walk with blinders on. I keep an eye on what is going on around in both the .NET land and in other frameworks and platforms. This is also not something that I believe that you can just sit still and let past&#xA0;results indicate future performance.  And, I think, the key point to take from Scott&#x27;s post and Ben&#x27;s question is that there is a distinct difference between saying: &quot;oh look, it can do back flips while singing the top 50, cool!&quot; vs. &quot;as a recognized leader...&quot;.</p>
