            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Recently I pulled some code from a colleague, and tried to test it. It worked, which was fine, so I let it run the tests, and went out to lunch. When I came back, I was surprised to discover that the build has failed, not because of some test failing, but because it couldn&#x2019;t compile. To be rather more exact, we go the following error:  [optimized-build] Using type script compiler: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript\1.4\tsc.exe&#xA; [optimized-build]&#xA; [optimized-build] System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception thrown:&#xA; [optimized-build] --------------------------&#xA; [optimized-build] The filename or extension is too long&#xA; [optimized-build] --------------------------&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;That was strange. I checked several times, and we had no such thing. No one had a veryVeryLongFileNameThatNeededToBeVeryExplicitAboutWhatItWasDoingAndDidNotCareAboutLength.ts.&#xA;And the tsc.exe location was in its normal place. This is from a part in our build process that gather all the TypeScript files and merge them into a single optimized bundle. And it suddenly failed. Now, on the colleague machine, it worked. The previous commit before I merged it, it worked. The merge was a clean one, and very obvious that nothing was going on there.&#xA;It took me a while, but I finally figured out that the error occurred because my colleague has added a new TypeScript file. &#xA;How can adding a file break the build?&#xA;As it turns out, the code we were calling did something like this:&#xA;&#xA;tsc.exe file1.ts file2.ts file3.ts&#xA;And at some point, the size of the command line we were passing to the process has exceeded 32KB. And that is when everything broke loose.&#xA;Luckily, we were able to write those things to a file and ask the compiler to load them directly, instead of passing them via the command line:&#xA;&#xA;tsc.exe @arguments.txt&#xA;And everything was okay again&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We care very deeply about the operations side of RavenDB. Support calls are almost never about &#x201C;where are you? I want to send you some wine &amp; roses&#x201D;, and they tend to come at unpleasant timing. One of the things that we had learnt was that when stuff breaks, it tend to do so in ways that are&#x2026; interesting. Let me tell you a story&#x2026;  A long time ago, a customer was using an index definition that relied on the presence of a custom assembly to enrich the API available for indexing. During the upgrade process from one major version of RavenDB to the next, they didn&#x2019;t take into account that they need to also update the customer assembly. When they tried to start RavenDB, it failed because of the version mismatch, since they weren&#x2019;t actually using that index anyway. The customer then removed the assembly, and started RavenDB again. At this point, the following sequence of events happened:  The database started, saw that it is using an old version of the storage format, and converted to the current version of the storage format. The database started to load the indexes, but the index definition was invalid without the customer assembly, so it failed. (Index definitions are validated at save time, so the code didn&#x2019;t double check that at the time). The customer was now stuck, the database format was already converted, so in order to rollback, they would need to restore from backup. They could also not remove the index from the database, because the database wouldn&#x2019;t start to let them do so. Catch 22. At this point, the admin went into the IndexDefinitions directory, and deleted the BadIndex.index-definition file, and restarted RavenDB again. The database then recognized that the index definition is missing, but the index exists, deleted the index from the server, and run happily ever after. Operations road bypass is our terminology for giving administrators a path to changing internal state in our system using standard tools, without requiring the system to be up and functioning. The example with the index definition is a good one, because the sole reason we keep the index definition on disk is to allow administrators the ability to touch them without needing RavenDB in a healthy state. What do you do in your system to make it possible for the admin to recover from impossible situations?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Testing our software is something that we take very serious. And in some cases, we want to go beyond testing stuff that we know. We want to test random stuff. For example, if we add 10,000 documents, then remove every 17th, what happens? Is there any differences in behavior, performance, etc? It is easy to do random stuff, of course. But that leads to an interesting case. As long as the tests are passing, you can pat yourself on the back: &#x201C;We have done good, and everything works as it should&#x201D;. But when something fails&#x2026; well, the only thing that you know is that something did fail. You don&#x2019;t have a way to reproduce this. Because the test is&#x2026; random. In order to handle that, we wrote the following code:  [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = true)]&#xA; public class InlineDataWithRandomSeed : DataAttribute&#xA; {&#xA; &#xA;     public InlineDataWithRandomSeed(params object[] dataValues)&#xA;     {&#xA;         this.DataValues = dataValues ?? new object[] {null};&#xA;     }&#xA; &#xA;     public object[] DataValues { get; set; }&#xA;&#xA;     public override IEnumerable&lt;object[]&gt; GetData(MethodInfo methodUnderTest, Type[] parameterTypes)&#xA;     {&#xA;         var objects = new object[DataValues.Length&#x2B;1];&#xA;         Array.Copy(DataValues,0,objects,0, DataValues.Length);&#xA;         objects[DataValues.Length] = Environment.TickCount;&#xA;         yield return objects;&#xA;         &#xA;     }&#xA; }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is using XUnit, which gives us the ability to add a seed to the test. Let us see how the test looks:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And this is what this looks like when it runs:&#xA;&#xA;When we have a failure, we know what the seed is, and we can run the test with that seed, and see what exactly happened there.</p>

The full session summary is:  Presentation: Highly Available &amp; Scalable Solutions with RavenDB Track: Solutions Track 1 / Time: Monday 13:20 - 14:10 / Location: Rosenborg RavenDB is a 2nd generation document database, with built-in load distribution, seamless replication, disaster recovery and data-driven sharding. In this session, we are going to explore how RavenDB deals with scaling under load and remain highly available even under failure conditions. We&#x27;ll see how RavenDB&#x27;s data-driven sharding allows to increase the amount of the data in our cluster without giving up the benefits of data locality. We are are going to execute complex distributed map-reduce queries on a sharded cluster, giving you lightning-fast responses over very large data volumes. Hibernating Rhinos will also be presenting at a booth, and we&#x2019;ll have a few members of the core team there to talk about RavenDB and the cool things that you can do with it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I like reading code, and recently I was mostly busy with moving our offices, worrying about insurance, lease contracts and all sort of other stuff that are required, but not much fun. So I decided to spend a few hours just going through random code bases and see what I&#x2019;ll find.  I decided to go with Go projects, because that is a language that I can easily read, and I headed out to this page. Then I basically scanned the listing for any projects that took my fancy. The current one is Wukong, which is a full text search engine. I&#x2019;m always interested in those, since Lucene is a core part of RavenDB, and knowing how others are implementing this gives you more options. This isn&#x2019;t going to be a full review, merely a record of my exploration into the code base. There is one problem with the codebase, as you can see here:  All the text is in Chinese, which I know absolutely nothing about, so comments aren&#x2019;t going to help here. But so far, the code looks solid. I&#x2019;ll start from the high level overview:  We can see that we have a searcher (of type Engine), and we add documents to it, then we flush the index, and then we can search it. Inside the engine.Init, the first interesting thing is this: &#xA0;   This is interesting because we see sharding from the get go. By default, there are two shards. I&#x2019;m sure what the indexers are, or what they are for yet. Note that there is an Indexer and a Ranker for each shard. Then we have a bunch of initialization routines that looks like so:  So we create two arrays of channels (the core Go synchronization primitive), and initialize them with a channel per shard. That is a pretty standard Go behavior, and usually there is a go routine that is spinning on each of those channels. That means that we have (by default) two &#x201C;threads&#x201D; for adding documents, and two for doing lookups. No idea what either one of those are yet. There is a lot more like this, for ranking, removing ranks, search ranks, etc, but that is just more of the same, and I&#x2019;ll ignore it for now. Finally, we see some actions when we start producing threads to do actual works:  As you can see, spin off go routines (which will communicate with the channels we already saw) to do the actual work. Note that per shard, we&#x2019;ll have as many index lookup and rank workers as we have CPUs.  There is an option to persist to disk, using the kv package, this looks like this:  On the one hand, I really like the &#x201C;let us just import a package from github&#x201D; option that go has, on the other hand. Versioning control has got to be a major issue here for big projects. Anyway, let us get back to the actual hot path I&#x2019;m interested in, indexing documents. This is done by this function: a Note that we have to supply the docId externally, instead of creating it ourselves. Then we just hash the docId and the actual content and send the data to the segmenter to do work. Currently I think that the work of the segmenter is similar to the work of the analyzer in Lucene. To break apart the content to discrete terms. Let us check&#x2026;  this certainly seems to be the case here, yep. This code run on as many cores as the machine has, each one handling a single segmentation request. Once that work is done, it is sent to another thread to actually do the indexing:  Note that the indexerRequest is basically an array of all the distinct tokens, their frequencies and the start positions in the original document. There is also handling for ranking, but for now I don&#x2019;t care about this, so I&#x2019;ll ignore this. Sending to the indexing channel will end up invoking this code:  And the actual indexing work is done inside AddDocument. A simplified version of it is show here:  An indexer is protected by a read/write mutex (which explains why we want to have sharding, it gives us better concurrency, without having to go to concurrent data structures and it drastically simplify the code. So, what is going on in here? For each of the keywords we found on the document, we create a new entry in the table&#x2019;s dictionary. With a value that contains the matching document ids. If there are already documents for this keyword, we&#x2019;ll search for the appropriate position in the index (using simple binary search), then place the document in the appropriate location. Basically, the KeywordIndices is (simplified) Dictionary&lt;Term : string , SortedList&lt;DocId : long&gt;&gt;. So that pretty much explains how this works. Let us look at how searches are working now&#x2026; The first interesting thing that we do when we get a search request is tokenize it (segmentize it, in Wukong terminology):  Then we call this code:  This is a fairly typical Go code. We create a bounded channel (that has a capacity as the same number of the shards), and we send it to all the shards. We&#x2019;ll get the reply from all of the shards, then do something with the results from all the shards. I like this type of interaction because it is easy to model concurrent interactions with it, and it is pervasive in Go. Seems simpler than the comparable strategies in .NET, for example. Here is a simple example of how this is used:  This is the variant without the timeout. And we are just getting the results from all the shards, note that we don&#x2019;t have any ordering here, we just add all the documents into one big array. I&#x2019;m not sure how/if Wukong support sorting, there was a lot of stuff about ranking earlier in the codebase, but that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be apparent in what I saw so far, I&#x2019;ll look at it later. For now, let us see how a single shard is handling a search lookup request. What I find most interesting is that there is rank options there, and document ids, which I&#x2019;m not sure what they are used for. We&#x2019;ll look at that later, for now, the first part of looking up a search term is here:  We take a read lock, then look at the table. We need to find entries for all the keywords that we have in the query to get a result back. This indicates that a query to Wukong has an implicit AND between all the terms in the query. The result of this is an array with all the indices for each keyword. It then continues to perform set intersection between all the matching keywords, to find all the documents that appear in all of them. Following that, it will compute the BM25 (a TF-IDF function that is used to compute ranking).&#xA0; After looking at the code, I found where it is actual compute the ranking. It is doing that after getting the results from all the shards, and then it is going to sort them according to their overall scores.     So that was clear enough, and it makes a lot of sense. Now, the last thing that I want to figure out before we are done, is how does Wukong handles deletions? It turns out that I actually missed part in the search process. The indexer will just find the matching documents, but their BM25 score. It is the ranker (which is sent from the indexer, and then replying to the engine) that will actually sort them. This gives the user the chance to add their own scoring mechanism. Deletion is actually handled as a case where you have nothing to score with, and it gets filtered along the way as an uninteresting value. That means that the memory cost of having a document index cannot be alleviated by deleting it. The actual document data is still there and is kept. It also means that there is no real facility to update a document. For example, if we have a document whose content used to say Ayende and we want to change it to Oren. We have no way of going to the Ayende keyword and removing it from there. We need to delete the document and create a new one, with a new document id. Another thing to note is that this has very little actual functionality. There is no possibility of making complex queries, or using multiple fields. Another thing that is very different from how Lucene works is that is runs entirely in memory. While it has a persistent option, that option is actually just a log of documents being added and removed. On startup, it will need to go through the log and actually index all of them again. That means that for large systems, it is going to be a prohibitly expensive startup cost. All in all, that is a nice codebase, and it is certainly simple enough to grasp without too much complexity. But one need to be aware of the tradeoffs associated with actually using it. I expect it to be fast, although the numbers mentioned in the benchmark page (if I understand the translated Chinese correctly) are drastically below what I would expect to see. Just to give you some idea, 1,400 requests a second are a very small number for an in memory index. I would expect something like 50,000 or so, assuming that you can get all cores to participate. But maybe they are counting this through the network ?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most frustrating things when you dealing with production issues is when the problem is not in our product, but elsewhere. In particular, this post is dedicated to the hard work done by many anti virus products, in particular, to make our life harder. Let us take a look at the following quote, taken from the ESET NOD32 Anti Virus knowledge base (emphasis mine):  By default, your ESET product automatically detects programs that are used as web browsers and email clients, and adds them to the list of programs that the internal proxy scans. This can cause loss of internet connectivity or other undesired results with applications that use network features but are not web browsers/email clients. Yes, it can. In fact, it very often does.  Previously, we looked at a similar issue with Anti Virus slowing down I/O enough to cause us to slowly die. But in this case, the issue is a lot more subtle. Because it is doing content filtering, it tends to put a much higher overhead on the system resources, which means that as far as the user is concerned, RavenDB is slow. We actually developed features specifically to handle this scenario. The traffic watch mode will tell you how much time you spend on the server side, and we have added a feature that will make RavenDB account for the internal work each query is doing, so we can tell where the actual cost is. You can enable that by issuing:  GET databases/Northwind/debug/enable-query-timing And one that is setup, you can get a good idea about what is costly in the query, as far as RavenDB is concerned. Here is an example of a very slow query:   You can see that the issue is that we are issuing a very wide range query, so most of the time is spent in inside Lucene. Other examples might be ridicilously complex queries, which result in high parsing time (we have seen queries in the hundreds of KB range). Or loading a lot of big documents, or&#x2026; you get the drift. If we see that the server thinks that a query is fast, but the overall time is slow, we know to blame the network. But an even more insidious issue is that this would drop requests,&#xA0; consistently and randomly (and yes, I know that those are contradictions, it was consistently dropping requests in a random pattern that seemed explicitly designed to thwart figuring out what is going on). Leading to things breaking, and escalated support calls. &#x201C;RavenDB is broken&#x201D; leads to a lot of headache, and a burning desire to hit something when you figure out that not only isn&#x2019;t it your fault, but the underlying reason is actively trying to prevent you from figuring it out (I assume it is to deal with viruses that try to shut it off), which lead to really complex find facting sessions. That is more annoying because it seems that the issue there was a bug in respecting keep alive sessions for authenticated requests under some scenarios, in the AV product in question! Absolutely not fun!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As you can imagine, I&#x2019;m really interested in what is going on with storage engines. So when I read the RocksDB Tuning Guide with interest. Actually, mounting horror was more like it, to be frank. It all culminated pretty nicely with the final quote:  Unfortunately, configuring RocksDB optimally is not trivial. Even we as RocksDB developers don&#x27;t fully understand the effect of each configuration change. If you want to fully optimize RocksDB for your workload, we recommend experiments&#x2026; Um&#x2026; okaaaay. That is pretty scary statement. Now, to be fair, RocksDB is supposed to be a low level embedded storage engine, it isn&#x2019;t meant to be something that is directly exposed to the user or operations people. And yet&#x2026; I&#x2019;m literally writing databases for a living, and I had a hard time following all the options they had there. And it appears that from the final thought that the developers of RocksDB are also at a loss here. It is a very problematic state to be in. Because optimizations and knowing how to get the whole thing working is a pretty important part of using a database engine. And if your optimizations process relies on &#x201C;change a bunch of settings&#x201D;, and see what happens, that is not kind at all. Remember, RocksDB is actually based on LevelDB, which is a database which was designed to be the backend of IndexdDB, which runs in the browser and has a single threaded client and a single user, pretty much. LevelDB can do a lot more than that, but that was the primary design goal, at least initially.  The problems with LevelDB are pretty well known, it suffers from write amplification, as well as known to hang if there is a compaction going on, and&#x2026; well, you can read on that elsewhere. RocksDB was supposed to take LevelDB and improve on all the issues that LevelDB had. But it appears that most of what was done was to actually create more configuration options (yes, I&#x2019;m well aware that this is an unfair statement, but it sure seems so from the tuning guide). What is bad here is that the number of options is very high, and the burden it puts on the implementers is pretty high. Basically, it is a &#x201C;change &amp; pray&#x201D; mindset. Another thing that bugs me is the number of &#x201C;mutex bottlenecks&#x201D; that are mentioned in the tuning guide, with the suggestions to shard things to resolve them. Now, to be fair, an embedded database require a bit of expertise, and cooperation from the host process, but that seems to be pushing it. It is possible that this is only required for the very high end usage, but that is still not fun. Compared to that, Voron has about 15 configuration options, most of them about controlling the default sizes we use. And pretty much all of them are set to be auto tuned on the fly. Voron on its on actually have very few moving parts, which makes reasoning about it much simpler and efficient.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The final monitoring feature in RavenDB 3.5 is SNMP support. For those of you who aren&#x2019;t aware, SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It is used primarily for monitoring network services. And with RavenDB 3.5, we have full support for it. We even registered our own root OID for all RavenDB work (1.3.6.1.4.1.45751, if anyone cares at this stage). We have also setup a test server where you can look at the result on SNMP support in RavenDB 3.5 (login as guest to see details). But what is this about?  Basically, a lot of monitoring features that we looked at boiled down to re-implementing enterprise monitoring tools that are already out there. Using SNMP gives all those tools direct access to the internal details of RavenDB, and allow you to plot and manage them using your favorite monitoring tools. From Zabbix to OpenView to MS MOM. We expose a long list of metrics, from the loaded databases to the number of indexes items per second to the ingest rate to the number of queries to how much storage space each database takes to&#x2026; Well, you can just go ahead and read the whole list and go over it.  We are still going to put effort into making figuring out what is going on with RavenDB directly from the studio, but as customers start running large numbers of RavenDB instances, it becomes unpractical to deal with each of them individually. That is why using a monitoring system that can watch many servers is preferable. You can also set it up to send alerts when certain threshold is reached, and&#x2026; those are now features that aren&#x2019;t RavenDB features, those are your monitoring system features.  Being able to just off load all of those features is great, because we can just expose the values to the monitoring tools and go on to focus on other stuff, rather than just have to do the full monitoring work, UI, configuration, alerts, etc.</p>
