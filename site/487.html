            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Users are almost always the simplest entity in your application. I mean, they usually just look like this:  How complex can something like that be? The answer is that as simple as something like that is, people still get it wrong, and quite often they get it horribly wrong.  Just to set the proper context, I am talking about applications that provide Software as a Service.&#xA0; For example, we may be building an Accounting SaaS system.  A user logs into the system, and gets to see his invoices, outstanding bills, etc. This sounds simple enough to do, so what is the reason for this post? The reason is that while this may sound simple, it is also wrong. The User Is The Account Let us introduce a few other semantics into the mix. I don&#x2019;t want to do accounting, so I get Pkida to do that for me. But, since my data is tied to my user account, I would have to provide her with my username and password. Now, I am willing to let Pkida do my accounting, but I am not going to give her my credentials. This is usually the first stumbling block for systems where &#x201C;user is an account&#x201D; model. You want multiple users to manage the same account. A good example of a system that for a very long time failed to handle this properly is Amazon AWS platform. For a long time, there was your AWS Account and your username, and they were pretty much one and the same. Consider the case of an IT department that wanted to use Amazon AWS. Until as recently as May 2011, they didn&#x2019;t have any way to have multiple people manage the account, because they would need a single user/pass for the entire thing. That is a huge problem for most scenarios. Sharing user/pass means that you lost control on the account:  You don&#x2019;t know who of the people who have access to the account made a particular change (no auditing).  You can&#x2019;t use standard approaches for detecting fraud.  It is much harder to change the password. Accounts Owns The Users The next step is to ask what happen when you have something like this:  Now we have a way to have an account, and it can have multiple users. And all is good in the world, right? Not so fast. What happens when it turns out that Pkida isn&#x2019;t just working for me, but actually manages the accounting for several companies, each of them is using the SaaS accounting package. In order to use the software, Pkida would now have to have a separate user account for every customer she manages. That sucks:  It may mean that you charge her for each account (she will go to a competitor). Some users would show very little activity. The amount of information you will have to do things like cross selling or targeted offers would be far reduced. It is annoying for the users. A much better option is a total separation of Users and Accounts. A user can have several accounts (usually with a default one selected), and they can use a single login to access each, and each account may have multiple users associated with it. This brings to question how you are going to handle charging people, but that is an issue for another post, and another day&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The question came up in the Mailing list, and I thought it would be a good thing to post about.  How do you handle reference data in RavenDB? The typical example in most applications would be something like the list of states, their names and abbreviations. You might want to refer to a state by its abbreviation, but still allow for something like this:  How do you handle this in RavenDB? Using a relational database, you would probably have a separate table just for states, and it is certainly possible to create something similar to that in RavenDB:  The problem with this approach is that is it a very wrong headed approach one for a document database. In a relational database, you have no choice but to threat anything that has many items as a table with many rows. In a document database, we have much better alternatives.  Instead of threating each state as an individual document, we can treat them as a whole value, like this:  In the sample, I included just a couple of states, but I think that you get the idea. Note the name of this document &#x201C;Config/States&#x201D;. What are the benefits of this approach?  We only have to retrieve a single document. We are almost always going to treat the states as a list, never as individual items. There is never a transactional boundary for modifying just a single state. In fact, I would usually say that this isn&#x2019;t good enough. I would try to centralized any/all of the reference data that we use in the application into a single document. There is a high likelihood that it would be a fairly small document even after doing so, and it would be insanely easy to cache.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned in passing that I didn&#x2019;t like that in the blog post about the MVC Profiler Support for RavenDB. There were three major reasons for that. First, I don&#x2019;t like code like this:  This seems to be incredibly invasive, it is really not something that I want to force on my users. Considering how much time I spent building and designing profilers, I have strong opinions about them. And one of the things that I consider as huge selling points for my profilers is that they are pretty much fire and forget. Once you initialize them, you can forget about all the rest. Obviously, a general purpose profiler like this can&#x2019;t do that, but I still don&#x2019;t like it very much. And since we were talking about profiling RavenDB, I saw no reason to go to something like this. Next, there is a pretty big focus on profiling SQL:  That is pretty meaningless for us when we talk about Profiling RavenDB. And finally, there was the Stack Trace management. Providing Stack Trace information is incredibly useful for a profiler, and the MVC Mini Profiler supports that, but I didn&#x2019;t like how it did it. Calling new StackTrace() is pretty expensive, and there are better ways of doing that. One of the goals for the RavenDB profiler is to allow people to run it in production, same as I am doing right now in this blog, after all.  Mostly, the decision to go and write it from scratch was based on making it easier for us to build something that made sense for our purposes, not try to re-use something that was built for a completely different purpose.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the horrible things about SecurityException is just how little information you are given. For example, let us take a look at:   Yes, that is informative. The real problem is that most security analysis is done at the method level, which means that _something_ in this method caused this problem. Which meant that in order to debug this, I have to change my code to be like this:   Which gives me this:  Just to point out, the first, second, etc are purely artificial method names, meant just to give me some idea about the problem areas for this purpose only. Then we need to go into the code in the First method and figure out what the problem is there, and so on, and so forth. Annoying, and I wish that I knew of a better way.</p>

One thing that I learned in particular from the RavenDB workshop is that just one day is just not enough, and we expanded the single day workshop into a two days course. I&#x2019;ll be giving this course in November, 3 &#x2013; 4 2011, in New York. And, of course, my old companion, the Advanced NHibernate Course, for the people who wants to grok NHibernate and really understand what is going on under the cover, and maybe even more important, why? That course will run on October 31 &#x2013; November 2, 2011, also in New York. And if you are from the other side of the pond, I&#x2019;ll be giving my Advanced NHibernate Course in Warsaw, Poland on October 17 &#x2013; 19, 2011.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There are several ways to handle schema changes in RavenDB. When I am talking about schema changes, I am talking about changing the format of documents in production. RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t have a &#x201C;schema&#x201D;, of course, but if your previous version of the application had a Name property for customer, and your new version have FirstName and LastName, you need to have some way of handling that. Please note that in this case I am explicitly talking about a rolling migration, not something that you need to do immediately.  We will start with the following code bases:    Version 1.0 Version 2.0  public class Customer&#xA;{&#xA;    public string Name {get;set;}&#xA;    public string Email {get;set;}&#xA;    public int NumberOfOrders {get;set;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;public class Customer&#xA;{&#xA;    public string FirstName {get;set;}&#xA;    public string LastName {get;set;}&#xA;    public string CustomerEmail {get;set;}&#xA;    public bool PreferredCustomer {get;set;}&#xA;} &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As I said, there are several approaches, depending on exactly what you are trying to do. Let us enumerate them in order. &#xA;Removing a property &#x2013; NumberOfOrders&#xA;As you can see, NumberOfOrders was removed from v1 to v2. In this case, there is absolutely no action required of us. The next time that this customer will be loaded, the NumberOfOrders property will not be bound to anything, RavenDB will note that the document have changed (missing a property) and save it without the now invalid property. It is self cleaning .&#xA;Adding a property &#x2013; PreferredCustomer&#xA;In this situation, what we have is a new property, and we need to provide a value for it. If there isn&#x2019;t any value for the property in the stored json, it won&#x2019;t be set, which means that the default value (or the one set in the constructor) will be the one actually set. Again, RavenDB will note that the document have changed, (have an extra property) and save it with the new property. It is self healing .&#xA;Modifying properties &#x2013; Email &#x2013;&gt; CustomerEmail, Name &#x2013;&gt; FirstName, LastName&#xA;This is where things gets annoying. We can&#x2019;t rely on the default behavior for resolving this. Luckily, we have the extension points to help us.&#xA;public class CustomerVersion1ToVersion2Converter : IDocumentConversionListener&#xA;{&#xA;    public void EntityToDocument(object entity, RavenJObject document, RavenJObject metadata)&#xA;    {&#xA;        Customer c = entity as Customer;&#xA;        if (c == null)&#xA;            return;&#xA;&#xA;        metadata[&quot;Customer-Schema-Version&quot;] = 2;&#xA;        // preserve the old Name proeprty, for now.&#xA;        document[&quot;Name&quot;] = c.FirstName &#x2B; &quot; &quot; &#x2B; c.LastName;&#xA;        document[&quot;Email&quot;] = c.CustomerEmail;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public void DocumentToEntity(object entity, RavenJObject document, RavenJObject metadata)&#xA;    {&#xA;        Customer c = entity as Customer;&#xA;        if (c == null)&#xA;            return;&#xA;        if (metadata.Value&lt;int&gt;(&quot;Customer-Schema-Version&quot;) &gt;= 2)&#xA;            return;&#xA;&#xA;        c.FirstName = document.Value&lt;string&gt;(&quot;Name&quot;).Split().First();&#xA;        c.LastName = document.Value&lt;string&gt;(&quot;Name&quot;).Split().Last();&#xA;        c.CustomerEmail = document.Value&lt;string&gt;(&quot;Email&quot;);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Using this approach, we can easily convert between the two version, including keeping the old schema in place in case we still need to be compatible with the old schema. &#xA;Pretty neat, isn&#x2019;t it?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I am talking about migrations, I am talking about changing the format of documents in production. RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t have a &#x201C;schema&#x201D;, of course, but if your previous version of the application had a Name property for customer, and your new version have FirstName and LastName, you need to have some way of handling that. Before getting around to discussing how to do this, I want to discuss when. There are basically two types of migrations when you are talking about RavenDB.  Immediate, shutdown &#x2013; there is a specific cutoff point, in which we will move from v1 to v2. That includes shutting down the application for the duration of the update. The shutdown is required because the v1 application expects to find Name property, the v2 application expects to first FirstName, LastName properties. If you try to run them both at the same time, you can get into a situation where each version of the application is fighting to enforce its own view. So the simplest solution is to shut down the application, convert the data and then start the new version. Rolling update &#x2013; your v2 application can handle the v1 format, which means that you can switch from the v1 app to v2 app fairly rapidly, and whenever the v2 application encounters the old format, it will convert it for your to the new one, potentially conserving the old format for a certain period.  I&#x2019;ll discuss exactly how to handle those in my next post.</p>
