        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Peter Laudati managed to hit basically all my red buttons in a single post, that is rare. He talks about the recent Alpha Geeks posts in the community, but I do believe that he is observing a different community.  It seems almost like a repeating cycle where there are highly skilled developers moaning about the lesser skilled&#xA0;developers around them. Ha? In&#xA0;the recent posts, the topics was never the developers, it was the tools from MS and their ability to be utilized effectively by developers outside the very thin line that was painted for most of them.  When I see&#xA0;developer tools coming out of Microsoft that support this group, I get excited because it makes my former job as a &#x27;shepherd&#x27; easier.&#xA0; I know that the tools will guide the folks who may not be experts and keep them on the path that has been outlined for them.&#xA0; Wizards, software factories, source control with check-in policies, etc, I jump for joy!&#xA0; Give me more!&#xA0; I know many of the large enterprise companies I consulted for could benefit greatly from all of these. I have no way to express just how bothered I am by this statement. Shepherd? Developers are not sheep! Maybe a further look is needed, one that goes beyond the sheering pens. The last time I run into this attitude, I was at prison. If I ever want to lord it over other people again, I would go back to being a warden. I had no idea that being a developer or a consultant carried with it the same danger of illusions of grandeurs.&#xA0; It looks like you want code monkeys to build your grand vision, that is fine, but those are not developers. I have been at places where they had the&#xA0;9 to 5 programmers, and you know, they were perfectly able to follow a technical conversation, learn what they needed to learn, and get their job done. They may not be slavering all over the new CTP bits or spreading the buzz about the vNext&#x2B;2, but to get to the point where you hand dumbed-down tools is showing acute contempt for the developers in question, and I find it insulting. Yes, there are thick headed developers, I have met some of them that were on top of everything (with applications that used all the GoF patterns) and couldn&#x27;t code their way out of a wet paper bag.  Putting the baseline of the tools not at the lowest common denominator but at the lowest point, period, is harmful.  The great thing about Visual Studio is that if&#xA0;you don&#x27;t want all the hand-holding of wizards, you just don&#x27;t use them. Um, no. Feel free to hand code an SSIS package, or a BizTalk process, build any complex WinForms UI without the designers. Most of the wizards and designers are producing bad code, aimed to build a demo quickly, not to build a maintainable application. As saying that I can code it by hand is all very well, if the framework and libraries support it, currently, a lot of the stuff that was raised is not possible to use effectively without the wizards. BTW, if you see a theme about SSIS, I am dealing with that right now... sigh (how the hell did I end up being the database guru? I learned SQL as a self defense, for crying out load!)  Microsoft has entire teams of people (mine included) that focus on supporting the developer community.&#xA0; Feedback, good and bad, is always welcome.&#xA0; While I can&#x27;t predict how the product teams will respond to it, I can tell you that they are listening. They may be listening, but there is decide lack of response, the other side of the conversation. The various insiders group doesn&#x27;t cut it, not when the first time most people see a product is when it is already too late to do any significant change on it.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rob Conery&#x27;s OR/M challenge leaves me with a problem. No, it is not that I can&#x27;t do that, it is that I am not sure how to answer it. The situation is complex because I want to show the entire application, otherwise we are just doing simple data access, and that has very little meaning on its own. The concept that I have in my head is an MVC application, with most of the focus on the controllers and the data access. The idea is to produce a Hibernating Rhinos screen cast showing how to solve it (actually, it would be two at least, since that is a big issue, I want to cover building the model first, and then, in a second episode, performance tricks). The problem is choosing how to do, because MVC means UI, and I don&#x27;t want to show the UI, people will focus on that instead of on the real issues. I thought about:  Doing it on the console, but that necessitate an MVC for the console. This probably means another episode, talking just about that. It is an interesting topic, because it is about using MVC in the abstract. The good thing here is that showing the SQL that certain actions causes is really easy, we just log it to the console. And of course, no UI to try to focus on.  Using MonoRail&#xA0; - that would make my life easier, but I am afraid it would increase the barrier to understanding. On the other hand, it would be a fairly advance MonoRail screen cast, so there is good here also.  Using WinForms - still, would need to build an MVC on top of WinForms, and I don&#x27;t really feel like doing that.  Using WebForms - you can&#x27;t do MVC in Web Forms, and I don&#x27;t feel like fighting it to get things done.

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rob Conery&#xA0;just put up an interesting post (more on that later) where he talks about my example of optimizing a page from 32 queries to 4. His conclusion to that was:  I think that&#x27;s a great sample of a page that was created by a developer who clearly doesn&#x27;t know their way around a tool No, it isn&#x27;t. That developer was me, and that was an explicit decision made when we started working. Up to some limit ( I think it is 50 queries per page ), you can do whatever you want for development. I don&#x27;t want to waste time of performance when I am developing, because it doesn&#x27;t really matter when I am developing, and later I can easily start optimizing it without touching anything else in the application. Just to give an idea, the relevant page took about a week to build, fairly complex UI, fairly complex interactions, etc. Performance is something that I can ignore until I need to deal with it, and dealing with it is fairly simple. Total time spent optimizing this page? One &amp; a half hours or so. The result was an order of magnitude improvement in performance. I see this as a success of this approach, because I didn&#x27;t have to think about performance at all when I built the page. The fun part? I can reduce the number of allowed queries at any time, and catch any &quot;rouge&quot; page and fix that easily as well. Once you did it once, it becomes very easy to understand what is going on. That is a great example of deciding what matters and when. The first concern is to get it working, get it looking right, and then getting it working fast and performant. And no, this is not a license to ignore performance at all (using customer.HugeOrderCollection.Count is still out), but it keep you focused on the task at hand.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post was prompt by an email that was   I&#x27;ve read many things on forums regarding the architecture of an ASP.NET 2.0 application which is using NHibernate. Personally I like most the idea with service module (not necessary web service, just an assembly with the role of a service). The main idea for me is to make the asp.net application independent of the NH.Therefore I consider that asp.net app should be aware only of the Model, Service.  My main concern is how can I make this service to force NH to be transparent for the main application. What I mean with this.Some of the methods from this assembly, that will return Model objects, will use directly HQL (these ones are no problem).But I will need for sure a wrapper over the NH session, in this way NH will became unknown to the main project.  The problem in creating this wrapper.Some of the methods are very simple...for example Delete, Save, GetById.The main problem is on creating the methods for retrieving the data based on a list of conditions.  To Most of everyone agree that having something like new SqlConnection() in your business level code is not a good idea. Why then people have much less trouble with code such as this?IList&lt;Customer&gt; customers =             session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Customer))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;.List&lt;Customer&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;//process customers&#xA;Yes, this is not a valid example, because this may be a sign that you are mixing your concerns here, but bear with me here, I am not going to build a 9 layer application just for demonstration purposes. If we frown on using a SqlConnection, why is using the session much more acceptable? Isn&#x27;t something like this preferred?public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomers()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;// do query here&#x9;&#xA;}&#xA;Well, it is certainly much more explicit than the previous example, isn&#x27;t it? The problem that I have with the code above is that it usually turn to something like:public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomers()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;using(ISession session = factory.OpenSession())&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//transaction handling omitted for brevity&#xA;&#x9; &#x9;return session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Customer))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;.List&lt;Customer&gt;();&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;}&#xA;The problem with that is that it misses out on one of the more important features of the platform, the Unit of Work implementation. It relegate the OR/M into a stupid tool getting/saving data from a persistence store. So, then you take the next step, and create something like IUnitOfWork, and abstract the Unit of Work implementation from the rest of the application.&#xA0;Problem solved, right?&#xA;Well, no, it isn&#x27;t. It is only &quot;solved&quot; for the very simple case. What happens when you want to do a more complex query? Or utilize features of the underlying OR/M to your best advantage.&#xA;I am going to pick LLBLGen and NHibernate as two OR/M products that have roughly similar capabilities, but radically different design. LLBLGen doesn&#x27;t use the Unit of Work pattern, for instance, so the abstraction above it fairly useless in this scenario. A lot of the stuff that you would do in one tool would be actively harmful in another. Trying to build an application in a way that would take advantage of only the basic features of the tool that you are using is a big disservice for the application, it complicate the programming model, and it wouldn&#x27;t gain you much flexibility in the end.&#xA;In my Rhino Commons library, I have two implementations of the IUnitOfWork interface, one for NHibernate, and the second for Active Record, which is NHibernate. I have explicitly made the choice to being able to take full advantage on the capabilities of NHibernate, which means that I can&#x27;t take the same code base and try to use that against another OR/M, even one that is using the Unit of Work pattern.&#xA;NHibernate is explicitly designed to be used in a way that doesn&#x27;t force a dependency between the domain model and NHibernate, but trying to abstract NHibernate from the service layer is a losing proposition. The service layer now does a translation from the NHibernate&#x27;s concepts to terms that are really NHibernate&#x27;s terms, but in the service layer&#x27;s namespace. You can&#x27;t port this code:FindAll&lt;Customers&gt;(&#xA;   new Predicate(Operator.Equality, &quot;City&quot;, &quot;London&quot;&#xA;);&#xA;As seen above, this is usually more awkward than the original syntax.&#xA;To be clear, this doesn&#x27;t mean that you can now freely scatter code all over the place that uses NHibernate directly. SoC is still king, but you should accept that trying to replace a core part of the system such as NHibernate is going to be a very costly endeavor. I have seen a few efforts where people have decided that they want to use NHibernate, but without taking a dependency on it. It was costly, confusing, and eventually abandoned, because the translation layer always had this one more feature that a developer needed that NHibernate supported. And adding this feature to the translation layer would have created 1:1 mapping between NHibernate concepts and the service layer concepts, making the whole effort pointless.&#xA;That approach also meant that you couldn&#x27;t take advantage of NHibernate&#x27;s tools such as NHibernate Query Generator, which can really make the syntax smooth.&#xA;What do I recommend, then?&#xA;&#xA;Evaluate the various OR/M implementations, and find out what fits your scenarios best.&#xA;Make full use of all the OR/M capabilities, don&#x27;t limit yourself to a strict subset because in the future you may want to replace it.&#xA;If independence from the OR/M is important to you, understand that no matter how you try, you would still have some dependencies, usually in a place that you wouldn&#x27;t look for, and that you will likely spend a lot of time on translation layer needlessly.&#xA;However, in that case, be sure to create a service layer that can express what you want to do in the terms of the domain. &#xA;What do I mean by that?&#xA;Instead of:&#xA;&#xA;session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Customer))&#xA0;&#x9;.Add(Expression.Eq(&quot;Name&quot;, london))&#xA0;&#x9;.List&lt;Customer&gt;();&#xA;Or even this:&#xA;&#xA;FindAll&lt;Customer&gt;(Where.Customer.City == london);&#xA;Which is fairly clear to read even if you are not really familiar with the syntax, try to do this:&#xA;&#xA;FindAll&lt;Customer&gt;(&#xA0; CustomerByCityFinder.With(london) );&#xA;This is an approach that can help isolate you from the complexity of the OR/M layer, but it means that you now separate the place where you do the query from the query itself. This is not a bad thing on itself, except that this is already done for you by the OR/M itself. Using NHQG, those queries are very expressive in the terms of the domain.&#xA;I reserve this approach for the more complex queries. Where the query is complex enough to have its own responsibilities.</p>

And while XSD schema &#x2B; intellisense is nice, do you really want to write something like an SSIS package using plain XML &#x2B; intellisense?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last night I commited WCF Integration&#xA0;to the Castle trunk. This is based in part on the work described here&#xA0;by Orand. The main idea here is that WCF should get the service instances from Windsor, which gives us all the usual advantages of IoC plus Windsor&#x27;s interceptors capabilities.&#xA0;It isn&#x27;t a lot of code, but it makes it much easier to work with WCF services.  Using it on a web application:  Call this in the beginning of the application (Global.Application_Start): WindsorServiceHostFactory.RegisterContainer(container);  Create a MyService.svc file and put this in it:&lt;%@ ServiceHost Service=&quot;component name in windsor&quot; &#xA;Factory=&quot;Castle.Facilities.WcfIntegration.WindsorServiceHostFactory, Castle.Facilities.WcfIntegration&quot; %&gt; &#xA;&#xA;Have fun&#xA;Using it from a non-web application:WindsorContainer windsorContainer = new WindsorContainer();&#xA;&#xA;windsorContainer.AddComponent(&quot;operations&quot;, typeof (IOperations), typeof (Operations));&#xA;Uri uri = new Uri(&quot;net.tcp://localhost/WCF.Facility&quot;);&#xA;WindsorServiceHost host = new WindsorServiceHost(windsorContainer, typeof (Operations),&#xA;                                                 uri);&#xA;host.Description.Endpoints.Add(&#xA;&#x9;new ServiceEndpoint(ContractDescription.GetContract(typeof (IOperations)),&#xA;&#x9;                    new NetTcpBinding(),&#xA;&#x9;                    new EndpointAddress(uri)));&#xA;host.Open();&#xA;Obviously you can cut down on this code significantly using the standard WCF configuration.&#xA;Another interesting thing is the ability to apply cross cutting concerns using IServiceBehavior / IEndPointBehavior. Any components that are registered with those interfaces on the container will be applied to all the services that are created this way. You can apply individual behaviors using the standard WCF means.&#xA;What is this not?&#xA;It is not here to replace WCF configuarion, and it deals specifically just with creating/disposing of services using Windsor. There are already good tools to configure WCF, and this approach takes full advantage of them.&#xA;The code has both tests and a sample site, have fun.</p>
