            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I am thinking about modern art, I am thinking about an experience that I had that was remarkably similar to this one:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I got a lot of comments regarding my review of the Northwind Starter Kit project.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is the deal, if you want to demonstrate complex ways to solve a problem, you had better make sure that you are actually solving a problem that requires a complex solution. If you are demonstrating how to solve a simple problem in a complex way, you are basically doing disservice to the reader.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;When I wanted to write a sample app to demonstrate something, I either chose to demonstrate the actual technology (writing a ToDo app) or I spent dozens of posts establishing the context (yes, that is Macto, I&#x2019;ll get back to it).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But since so many people seems to have been offended by my slight of dismissing the project based on what seemed like just the number of projects, I&#x2019;ll do a full review series on that. My point was to make it clear that creating complex solutions for simple problems is wrong, especially if you are trying to demonstrate a real workable system. Without the proper context, all of this stuff is just cargo cult.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I continue to try to find a sample application for Northwind to use as my contrasting example for an article that I am writing, and I found the Northwind Starter Kit project. Even the project summary page gave me a few twitches, here is a small piece with the twitch inducing stuff bolded:  The application has been designed using common patterns, such as the ones defined within the &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Designs Patterns&quot; by Erich Gamma et al. and &quot;Pattern of Enterprise Application Architecture&quot;, by Martin Fowler; though not required, these lectures are strongly recommended. Guys! This is Northwind, the likelihood that you&#x2019;ll need design patterns to build this application is nil to none! That just screens complexity overload.  Domain logic is implemented by means of a Domain Model, onto a layer of services adds application logic. The model is persisted by a DAL designed around the principles of the &quot;Repository&quot; patterns, which has been implemented in a LINQ-friendly way. Northwind is a CRUD app, at its core, all of those things are adding complexity, and they aren&#x2019;t really adding much at all. In fact, they are going to create just noise, and make working with things that much harder. And then I opened the project, and I got this:   I mean, really? Seriously?!&#xA0; 22(!) projects to do a sample application using Northwind? This is the point where I gave up on this as something that could be useful, but here are a few other gems as well:   I really like how the Update method does what it is meant to do, right? Note that in either implementation, we are looking at totally and drastically different behavior.   Let us look at the interface, too:  The design is straight out of Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, and it is totally the wrong design to be using if you are using a modern OR/M.    Seriously, this is Northwind we are talking about, why make things so freaking complex?!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am a strong believer in automated unit tests. And I read this post by Phil Haack with part amusement and part wonder.  RavenDB currently has close to 1,400 tests in it. We routinely ask for failing tests from users and fix bugs by writing tests to verify fixes. But structuring them in terms of source code? That seems to be very strange. You can take a look at the source code layout of some of our tests here: https://github.com/ayende/ravendb/tree/master/Raven.Tests/Bugs It is a dumping ground, basically, for tests. That is, for the most part, I view tests as very important in telling me &#x201C;does this !@#! works or not?&#x201D; and that is about it. Spending a lot of time organizing them seems to be something of little value from my perspective. If I need to find a particular test, I have R# code browsing to help me, and if I need to find who is testing a piece of code, I can use Find References to get it. At the end, it boils down to the fact that I don&#x2019;t consider tests to be, by themselves, a value to the product. Their only value is their binary ability to tell me whatever the product is okay or not. Spending a lot of extra time on the tests distract from creating real value, shippable software. What I do deeply care about with regards to structuring the tests is the actual structure of the test. It is important to make sure that all the tests looks very much the same, because I should be able to look at any of them and figure out what is going on rapidly. I am not going to use the RavenDB example, because that is system software and usually different from most business apps (although we use a similar approach there). Instead, here are a few tests from our new ordering system: [Fact]&#xA;public void Will_send_email_after_trial_extension()&#xA;{&#xA;    Consume&lt;ExtendTrialLicenseConsumer, ExtendTrialLicense&gt;(new ExtendTrialLicense&#xA;    {&#xA;        ProductId = &quot;products/nhprof&quot;,&#xA;        Days = 30,&#xA;        Email = &quot;you@there.gov&quot;,&#xA;    });&#xA;&#xA;    var email = ConsumeSentMessage&lt;NewTrial&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;    Assert.Equal(&quot;you@there.gov&quot;, email.Email);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;[Fact]&#xA;public void Trial_request_from_same_customer_sends_email()&#xA;{&#xA;    Consume&lt;NewTrialConsumer, NewTrial&gt;(new NewTrial&#xA;    {&#xA;        ProductId = &quot;products/nhprof&quot;,&#xA;        Email = &quot;who@is.there&quot;,&#xA;        Company = &quot;h&quot;,&#xA;        FullName = &quot;a&quot;,&#xA;        TrackingId = Guid.NewGuid()&#xA;    });&#xA;    Trial firstTrial;&#xA;    using (var session = documentStore.OpenSession())&#xA;    {&#xA;        firstTrial = session.Load&lt;Trial&gt;(1);&#xA;    }&#xA;    Assert.NotNull(ConsumeSentMessage&lt;SendEmail&gt;());&#xA;    &#xA;    Consume&lt;NewTrialConsumer, NewTrial&gt;(new NewTrial&#xA;    {&#xA;        TrackingId = firstTrial.TrackingId,&#xA;        Email = firstTrial.Email,&#xA;        Profile = firstTrial.ProductId.Substring(&quot;products/&quot;.Length)&#xA;    });&#xA;&#xA;    var email = ConsumeSentMessage&lt;SendEmail&gt;();&#xA;    Assert.Equal(&quot;Hibernating Rhinos - Trials Agent&quot;, email.ReplyToDisplay);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can probably see, we have a structured way to send input to the system, and we can verify the output and the side affects (creating the trial, for example).&#xA;This leads to a system that can be easily tested, but doesn&#x2019;t force us to spend too much time in the ceremony of tests.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For an article I am writing, I wanted to compare a RavenDB model to a relational model, and I stumbled upon the following Northwind.NET project. I plugged in the Entity Framework Profiler and set out to watch what was going on. To be truthful, I expected it to be bad, but I honestly did not expect what I got. Here is a question, how many queries does it take to render the following screen?  The answer, believe it or no, is 17:  You might have noticed that most of the queries look quite similar, and indeed, they are. We are talking about 16(!) identical queries: SELECT [Extent1].[ID]           AS [ID],&#xA;       [Extent1].[Name]         AS [Name],&#xA;       [Extent1].[Description]  AS [Description],&#xA;       [Extent1].[Picture]      AS [Picture],&#xA;       [Extent1].[RowTimeStamp] AS [RowTimeStamp]&#xA;FROM   [dbo].[Category] AS [Extent1]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Looking at the stack trace for one of those queries led me to:&#xA;&#xA;And to this piece of code:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;You might note that dynamic is used there, for what reason, I cannot even guess. Just to check, I added a ToArray() to the result of GetEntitySet, and the number of queries dropped from 17 to 2, which is more reasonable. The problem was that we passed an IQueryable to the data binding engine, which ended up evaluating the query multiple times.&#xA;And EF Prof actually warns about that, too:&#xA;&#xA;At any rate, I am afraid that this project suffer from similar issues all around, it is actually too bad to serve as the bad example that I intended it to be.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In theory, there is no difference between theory and real life. In my previous blog post, I discussed my belief that the best value you get from learning is learning the very basic of how our machines operate. From learning about memory management in operating systems to the details of how network protocols like TCP/IP work. Some of that has got to be theoretical study, actually reading about how those things work, but theory isn&#x2019;t enough. I don&#x2019;t care if you know the TCP specs by heart, if you haven&#x2019;t actually built a real system with it, and experienced the pain points, it isn&#x2019;t really meaningful. The best way to learn, at least from my own experiences, is to actually do something. Because that teaches you several very interesting things:  What are the differences between the spec and what is actually implemented? How to resolve common (and not so common problems)? The later is probably the most important thing. I think that I learned most of what I know about HTTP in the process of building an RSS feed reader. I learned a lot about TCP from implementing a proxy system, and I did a lot of learning from a series of failed projects regarding distributed programming in general. I learned a lot about file systems and how to work with file based storage from Practical File System Design and from building Rhino Queues and Rhino DHT. In retrospect, I did a lot of very different projects in various areas and technologies.  The best way that I know to get better is to do, to fail, and to learn from what didn&#x2019;t work. I don&#x2019;t know of any shortcuts, although I am familiar with plenty of ways of making the road much longer (and usually not very pleasant). In short, if you want to get better, pick something that you don&#x2019;t know how to do, and then do it. You might fail, you likely will, but you&#x2019;ll learn a lot from failing.  I keep drawing a blank when people ask me to suggest options for things to try building, so I thought that I would ask the readers of this blog. What sort of things do you think would be useful to build? Things that would push most people out of their comfort zone and make them learn the fundamentals of how things work.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the questions that I routinely get asked is &#x201C;how do you learn&#x201D;. And the answer that I keep giving is that I had accidently started learning things from the basic building blocks. I still count a C/C&#x2B;&#x2B; course that I took over a decade ago as one of the chief reasons why I have a good grounding in how computers actually operate. During that course, we had to do anything from building parts of the C standard library on our own to construct much of the foundation of C&#x2B;&#x2B; features in plain C. That gave me enough understanding of how things are actually implemented to be able to grasp how things are behaving elsewhere. Digging deep into the implementation is almost never a wasted effort. And if you can&#x2019;t peel away the layer of abstractions, you can&#x2019;t really say that you know what you are doing.  For example, I count myself ignorant in all manners about WCF, but I have full confidence that I can build a system using it. Not because I understand WCF itself, but because I understand the arena in which it plays. I don&#x2019;t need to really understand how a certain technology works, if I already know what are the rules it has to play with. Picking on WCF again, if you don&#x2019;t know firewalls and routers, you can&#x2019;t really build a WCF system, regardless of how good your memory is about the myriad ways of configuring WCF to do you will. If you can&#x2019;t use WireShark to figure out why the system is slow to respond to requests, it doesn&#x2019;t matter if you can compose an WCF envelope message literally on the back of a real world envelope.&#xA0; If you don&#x2019;t grok the Fallacies of Distributes Computing, you shouldn&#x2019;t be trying to build a real system where WCF is used, regardless of whatever certificate you have from Microsoft. The interesting bit is that for most of what we do, the rules are fairly consistent. We all have to play in Turing&#x2019;s sand box, after all. What this means is that learning the details of IP and TCP will be worth it over and over again. Understanding things like memory fetch latencies would be relevant in 5 years and in ten. Knowing what actually goes on in the system, even if it at a somewhat abstracted level is important. That is what make you the master of the system, instead of its slave. Some of the things that I especially value, and that is of the top of my head and isn&#x2019;t a closed list are:  TCP / UDP &#x2013; how do they actually work. HTTP &#x2013; and implications (for example, state management). The Fallacies of Distributed Computing. Disk based storage &#x2013; efficiently working with it, how file system works. Memory management in OS and your environment. Obviously, this is a very short list, and again, it isn&#x2019;t comprehensive.&#xA0; It is just meant to give you some indications for things that I have found to be useful over and over and over again. That kind of knowledge isn&#x2019;t something that is replaced often, and it will help you understand how anyone else has to interact with the same constraints. In fact, it often allows you to accurately guess how they solve a certain problem, because you are aware of the same alternatives that the other side had to solve. In short, if you seek to be a better developer, dig deep and learn the real basic building blocks for our profession. In my next post, I&#x2019;ll discuss strategies for doing that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">TLDR;  Replication topologies make my head hurt. One of our customers had an interesting requirement, several months ago:  Basically, he wanted to write a document at node #1, and have it replicate, through node #2, to node #3. That was an easy enough change, and we did that. But then we got another issue from a different customer, who had the following topology:  And that client problem is that when making a write to node #1, it would be replicated to nodes 2 &#x2013; 4, each of which would then try to update the other two with the new replication information (it would skip node #1 because it is the source). That would cause&#x2026; issues, because they already had that document in place. In order to resolve that, I added a configuration option, which controls whatever the node that we replicate to should receive only documents that were modified on the current node, or whatever we need to include documents that were replicated to us from other nodes as well. It is a relatively small change, code wise. Of course, documenting this, and all of the options that follows is going to be a much bigger task, because now you have to make a distinction between replicating nodes, gateway nodes, etc.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Recently I had a spate of posts showing up, and then reporting 404. The actual reason behind that was that the server and the database disagreed with one another with regards to the timezone of the post (one was using UTC, the other local). Sorry for the trouble, and this shouldn&#x2019;t happen any longer.</p>
