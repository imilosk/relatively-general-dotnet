            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I set out today to write something that I never did before, but which I thought was too small to deserve a true spike. I&#x27;m talking about my persistance to code implementation, of course.I started by writing the following test:[Test]public void SaveEmptyGrap(){&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Graph g = new Graph();&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; g.Save(sw);&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; string actual = sw.ToString();&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Assert.AreEqual(&quot;??&quot;,actual);}I had no idea what I was going to get, but I went ahead and played with the code until it compiled, and then I looked at the result, verified that it was correct* and used that as the expected value.I could then move on to the next test, graph with nodes, using the same method.* Just to note, it turned out that I missed putting the method name in Code Dom, which meant that my expected string were wrong. I found out about that only when I tried to load the graphs again. It wasn&#x27;t hard to fix, but I wanted to point out that this method has its weak points.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There has been a lot said about testing and their affect on the code. I just had the tests affect me as I write the code. You are probably aware that I started a new project recently, and I&#x27;ve (as always) taken my time with a lot of spiking on the design.Even when I am spiking, I feel very nervous without the tests, and because I&#x27;m making such profound changes to the application, there are long stretches of times when I can&#x27;t even get the application to compile.This mean that thinking about something and seeing it fail (and it always fails the first time) takes very long time. It also means that I waste quite a bit of time in going the wrong direction.Today was the day when I finally settled on the design that I would have, and started sweeping thorugh the code, looking for stuff that needs to be tested. I think about this an un-legacifying the code that I wrote this past week (which had only two tests, one of them 40 lines long, yuck!).I added a lot more tests, renamed a couple of methods, applied the Law of Demeter and voila, I got a code base that is a pleasure to work with.Then I could start writing features using TDD, and get the rapid feedback that I crave. I actually added value today, which is a great feeling to have in the end of the day.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I posted a few days ago about Saving object graphs to file: CodeGen and Executable GraphsI just wrote the final test that made it all happen! I got objects that knows how to persist their state to code, and then load themselves right back from this code.This is the first time I worked in Code Dom, and it was very easy to get it to work very quickly.This is a huge security hole, of course, but I&#x27;ll probably just play with the AppDomain permissions so the only thing it will be able to do is to give me the complete object graph. I got to say, there is quite a bit of satisfaction in saving files in this format. Very readable.</p>

This time, I wanted to comment about the part &#xA;where Rocky talks about ORM. Before everything else, I would like to comment on &#xA;something he said about Microsoft and O/RM.&#xA;He said that most O/RM are using Reflection, and that only Microsoft can &#xA;solve this issue, because the can modify the CLR to allow direct access to &#xA;private fields.&#xA;I wanted to note that there is already such a thing in .Net 2.0, and it is &#xA;called LCG (Lightwieght Code Generation), and it basically means that you can &#xA;inject a method into a class, which will have full access to all the class&#x27; &#xA;members, regardless of visibility (just as any class on the object does). There &#xA;is a patch for NHibernate that allows it to use this functionality in .Net 2.0, &#xA;so you don&#x27;t need to me Microsoft to use this.&#xA;I would also like to comment that NHibernte is already avoiding Reflection &#xA;whenever possible, relying on runtime code generation to read and write to &#xA;public properties / fields.&#xA0;&#xA;I want to address another part of what he said, where he said that O/RM &#xA;assumes that objects are structure the same way as the database is. Only the &#xA;simplest O/RM assumes this. One of the important charactaristics of objects is &#xA;not the data they contain, but what type of object you have, and what relations &#xA;it has to other objects. A good O/RM will know to map the schema of a database &#xA;to your object structure without impacting the design of the object.&#xA;In fact, I would go as far as to say that this is the criteria of good &#xA;O/RM.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was listening yesterday to DotNetRocks episode 169 with Rocky Lhotka, and I was muttering &quot;WTF??!!&quot; throughout the first part of the show.    The issue that I had was Rocky talking about TDD and saying stuff that simply didn&#x27;t match the reality, not by a long shot. Jeffery Palermo&#xA0;post about it as well, by the way.    Rocky&#x27;s main objections seem to be:When you are working Test First, you don&#x27;t get intelli sense for classes and methods that don&#x27;t exists, and that seem to hurt his development style.     First, what is the problem. You just created a class, why do you need intelli sense for something that you&#x27;ll write in a few minutes? Yes, it is convient, but the rate of creating new methods / classes in my code is not high enough that I will forget that I created that class 3 minutes ago and need to think about the interfce I want to give it.    Second, good enough tools like the wonderful ReSharper or VS.Net 2005 (far less powerful) will gladly create classes and method for you on the fly when you refer to something that do not exist. This is not an issue.Test First require that you will first write the test, and then write the code. Doesn&#x27;t mesh well with programming by the wizards.     Considerring that most of the wizards have to do with UI in the first place, and considerring the big problems in testing UI, I would say that this is a non issue. If I think that I need something that doesn&#x27;t work directly in the UI, I can&#x27;t see how the wizards and the tools will help me any. I am aware that other people feels just the opposite.    That said, do you really think that you can trust the code that the wizard generates? Or are you going to run it through it paces a few times, just to make sure it works? If you intend to check it yourself, you need a test for this (or several). You will change this part of the code, and you need it covered. I would also argue that you get far better design and working experiance when working in TDD fashion that you do with all the wizards.You write a bunch of tests, and then you&#x27;ve to write the code to make them work, which is hard.    You know what, he is right on this one, which is why you never write a bunch of tests and then try to implement them. You write one test, then you make it work, then you write another test, etc.On a large system, it is hard to test one method at a time.    This is possible, and it indicate a design problem in the code, fix it. Check out &quot;Working Effectively With Legacy Code&quot; for the details. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to change something in a large system without tests. How do I know that I didn&#x27;t break anything?    If he is talking that it is hard to TDD a feature with small increments, than he is right, it takes some work. The end result is worth it since you got a decoupled design you know is working.Ater writing a test, developers fear to refactor the system, since it will break the test.    I was literally ranting at this point, and this one is really over the top. If I have ever heard a falser statement... TDD is made up of three things: &quot;Red, Green, Refactor&quot;. If you don&#x27;t do all three, you are not doing TDD. What he calls refactoring is not that, it&#x27;s random code movement through the code, with the prevent wishes of the developer that he isn&#x27;t breaking anything. Thanks, but &quot;Code and Pray&quot; are not for me.It&#x27;s easy to write your own test harness in&#xA0;a couple of lines.    Yes, it is easy, but you are only running one test that you keep changing, you are not check other parts of the code, can&#x27;t add it to the build process, etc. In essense, this &quot;test harness&quot; is merely a way to execute the code as it would be on the production system, so you could debug the problems. I would rather not debug at all, and get a nice warm blanket of tests telling me where I am doing wrong.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Both Analtoly and Oren Ellenbogen&#xA0;&#xA0;had commented on my commenting post (pun intended). The example we are using right now is this piece of code:            outputs&#xA0;=&#xA0;new&#xA0;EntitySet&lt;IConnection&gt;(        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;delegate(IConnection&#xA0;connection)&#xA0;{&#xA0;Raise(OutputAdded,&#xA0;connection);&#xA0;},        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;delegate(IConnection&#xA0;connection)&#xA0;{&#xA0;Raise(OutputRemoved,&#xA0;connection);&#xA0;}        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;);         I argue that this piece of code should stand on its own, without any comments to explain what is going here. I think at least part of the issue here is that I am focusing entirely on the comments on the code and not XML Comments. Here is the code for the EntitySet, the class start with a big XML comment that start with general explanation on the class and then goes on to some detail with regard to some detailed implementation that has to do with NHibernate.    To quote the first part of the comments:///&#xA0;This&#xA0;class&#xA0;handle&#xA0;strong&#xA0;typing&#xA0;collections&#xA0;that&#xA0;you&#xA0;get&#xA0;from        ///&#xA0;NHibernate.        ///&#xA0;It&#xA0;also&#xA0;handles&#xA0;adding/removing&#xA0;items&#xA0;to&#xA0;the&#xA0;other&#xA0;end&#xA0;(by&#xA0;allowing        ///&#xA0;you&#xA0;to&#xA0;specify&#xA0;delegates&#xA0;to&#xA0;do&#xA0;it).    And the constructor that I&#x27;m calling about is defined as:public&#xA0;EntitySet(Action&lt;T&gt;&#xA0;add,&#xA0;Action&lt;T&gt;&#xA0;remove)    Putting this two together, I&#x27;m comportable with not commenting what is going on in the output declaration. It should be obvious by reading the xml comment on EntitySet&lt;T&gt; and seeing the constructor overload I&#x27;m using.    With regard to commenting on a library code, Anatoly said:When you call the library function, the comment what the function does should be in the header of the function. When you change implementation you change the comment. When you call the library function (even in several places) need to say what the line of code does (calling x expecting y) here it may be very light.&#xA0;But still need to comment.     If I need to comment on the callsite for a method, that is a sign for bad design on my code. The possible exceptions is I&#x27;m doing something non standard there (like expecting spesific result because the conditions are just right) and if I&#x27;m doing it more than once, I need to refactor to remove the comments.    The case above is a classic one, I think. If you don&#x27;t understand what is going on there, you really don&#x27;t understand what is going here. It&#x27;s not a question of not understanding some side affects. In this case it&#x27;s whatever you know what the library does or not. Ayende:&#xA0;You seem to say that the code should be optimized for someone completely ignorant about the project, just seating down and understanding what is going on.             Anayoly: Something like this. My point is that clear and self-descriptive code is a must but it does not mean that you don&#x27;t need comments.         This is the part I disagree with most strongly, I think. Clear code doesn&#x27;t need call site comments. They are a chore to write when you write the code, they are noise when you read the code. On heavily commented code, my eyes gets into &#x27;ads-skipping&#x27; mode, and I literally don&#x27;t see them more than green blurs on the screen.    I tend to think that a big enough project require some rumping up time before you understand what is going on. Anatoly says that it is possible to have a new guy on a project and starting to contribute useful features in a very short times (minutes to hours).I&#x27;ve seen accessible projects. You feel the difference right away.     Could you explain what made it accessible? Was it that you were familiar with the technology and the development methods that were used? Was it good documentation? How much time did you spend reading the comments in the code in order to learn what is going on there. I said in the comment that I believe that it is possible only on &quot;common ground&quot; projects, where the architecture is mostly the same.     Moving to Oren&#x27;s comment about this now. The first suggestion that you had (refactor creating the outputs into a method that would have a comment there) is something that I would generally prefer to do if the code needed explaining. In this case, do you think that the comments on the class and the naming of the parameters are enough?It seems to me (I&#x27;m guilty at this as well) that you fall in love with complex code but you forgot that someone else would have to maintain your code somewhere in the future.     Yes, and no. I sometimes does complex code for the fun of it, but I don&#x27;t intend to take this code to production. There is some elegance for complex code that works. But if I look at it afterward and need&#xA0;more than a&#xA0;minute to understand what i did there, it&#x27;s useless, in my eyes. This is part of the reason I like peer programming. You can&#x27;t do stuff too complicated without sounding it out first, and then the other guy will likely offer a better / simpler way to do this.    I just had a case where i wrote a method that passed a test, but when I went back to the method and looked at it, I had no idea what was going there. I ended up breaking the method to several smaller methods, so I got something like:            AssertNoCycles();        List&lt;Node&gt;&#xA0;visited&#xA0;=&#xA0;new&#xA0;List&lt;Node&gt;();        foreach(Node&#xA0;node&#xA0;in&#xA0;graph.Nodes)        {        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;DoWork(node,&#xA0;visited);        }        AssertAllNodeWereVisited(visited)        Imagine that each of those methods in inlined, and you&#x27;ll start to see the problem, I guess. My first instinct is to break the code to manageble pieces rather than explain what I did there.    I liked Oren&#x27;s second suggestion, which is to have a certral repository of &quot;Required Reading&quot; before you can work on the project. I&#x27;m not talking about 1,600 design guides. I&#x27;m talking about much simpler stuff like: This project uses the following libraries, and here are the documentation. You probably need to check the following three links to get up to speed with what they do, and we are using them to do this and that (links to everything).     This allows you to assume a common base for the people that would work on the project.</p>
