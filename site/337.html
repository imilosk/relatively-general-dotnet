            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So the first thing to tackle is the over the wire protocol. RavenDB is a REST based system, working purely within HTTP. A lot of that was because at the time of conception, REST was pretty much the thing, so it was natural to go ahead with that. For many reasons, that has been the right decision.  The ability to easily debug the over the wire protocol with a widely available tool like Fiddler makes it very easy to support in production, script it using curl or wget and in general make it easier to understand what is going on.  On the other hand, there are a bunch of things that we messed up on. In particular, RavenDB is using the HTTP headers to pass the the document metadata. At the time, that seemed like an elegant decision, and something that is easily in line with how REST is supposed to work. In practice, this limited the kind of metadata that we can use to stuff that can pass through HTTP headers, and forced some constraints on us (case insensitivity, for example), and there have been several cases where proxies of various kind inserted their own metadata that ended up in RavenDB, sometimes resulting in bad things happening. When looking at RavenDB 4.0, we made the following decisions:  We are still going to use HTTP as the primary communication mechanism. Unless we have a good reason to avoid it, we are going to be human readable over the wire. So now instead of sending document metadata as HTTP headers, we send them inside the document, and use headers only to control HTTP itself. That said, we have taken the time to analyze our protocol, and we found multiple places where we can do much better. In particular, the existence of web sockets means that there are certain scenarios that just became tremendously simpler for us. RavenDB has several needs for bidirectional communications. Bulk inserts, Change API, subscriptions, etc. The fact that web sockets are now pretty much available across the board means that we have a much easier time dealing with those scenarios. In fact, the presence of web sockets in general is going to have a major impact on how we are doing replication, but that will be the topic of another post. Beyond the raw over the wire protocol, we also looked at a common source for bugs, issues and trouble: IIS. Hosting under IIS means that you are playing by IIS rules, which can be really hard to do if you aren&#x2019;t a classic web application. In particular, IIS has certain ideas about size of requests, their duration, the time you have to shut down or start up, etc. In certain configurations, IIS will just decide to puke on you (if you have a long URL, it will return 404, with no indication why, for example), resulting in escalated support calls.&#xA0; One particular support call happened because a database took too long to open (as a result of a rude shutdown by IIS), which resulted in IIS aborting the thread and hanging the entire server because of an abandoned mutex. Fun stuff like that. In RavenDB 4.0 we are going to be using Kestrel exclusively, which simplify our life considerably. You can still front it with IIS, of course (or ngnix, etc), for operational, logging, etc reasons. But this means that RavenDB will be running its own process, worry about its own initialization, shutdown, etc. It makes our life much easier. That is about it for the protocol bits, in the next post, I&#x2019;ll talk about the most important aspect of a database, how the data actually gets stored on disk.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that happens when you start using RavenDB is that you start using more of it, and more of its capabilities. The problem there is that often users end up with a common set of stuff that they use, and they need to apply it across multiple databases (and across multiple servers).  This is where the Global Configuration option comes into play. This allows you to define the behavior of the system once, and have it apply to all your databases, and using the RavenDB Cluster option, you can apply it across all you nodes in on go.  As you can see in the image, we are allowing to configure this globally, for the entire server (or multiple servers), instead of having to remember to configure it for each. The rest of the tabs are pretty much the same manner. You can configure global behavior (and override it on individual databases, of course). Aside from the fact that it is available cluster-wide, this isn&#x2019;t a major feature, or a complex one, but it is one that is going to make it easier for the operations team to work with RavenDB.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned in my previous post that one of the things that pushed the design of RavenDB 4.0 is retrospective analysis. In particular, , &quot;if we had to do it all over again, rewind the clock to 2008, and design RavenDB from the ground up with all the knowledge that we currently have, what would we do differently?&quot;. The problem with this approach is that we have shipping software, we have stuff that customers have been using for over six years, so it isn&#x2019;t like we can start from scratch, and as tempting a decision that would be, it is almost always the wrong decision. RavenDB 4.0 isn&#x2019;t a re-write, it is a major architectural change, driven by own experience in what is painful.&#xA;That is a good guideline, but what does this mean? We had a few rounds of thoughts around this, and we ended up with the following decisions.&#xA;As a major version release, we aren&#x2019;t bound by backward compatibility, and we are going to take full advantage of that. That means that a 4.0 server cannot be accessed by a 3.0 client, and a 3.0 server can&#x2019;t replicate to a 4.0 server. From the point of view of the wire protocol, we have taken the chance to fix some long standing issues, but I&#x2019;ll have another post about that. Internally, an upgrade from 3.0 to 4.0 will probably be done by a dedicated migration tool, unlike the previous &#x201C;in place&#x201D; upgrade procedure that we previously had. The reason for those decisions is that this gives us a lot of flexibility in fixing our implementation and change how we are doing things.&#xA;At the same time, from an external point of view, users of RavenDB should see as little change as we can get away with. Ideally, the process of upgrading a new piece of software to RavenDB 4.0 should be:&#xA;&#xA;Update the Nuget package&#xA;Recompile&#xA;&#xA;And that would be it. In practice, I&#x2019;m sure that we&#x2019;ll have edge cases and things that would require a bit more work from the user, but that is the goal, that as far as users are concerned, they don&#x2019;t have to do a lot of extra work to upgrade.&#xA;We&#x2019;ll probably have a lot of discussions around what exactly we can change, and what we must absolutely have. In some of the discussion we had with our customers we already learn that running on 32 bits is a hard requirement for some of them, which means that RavenDB 4.0 will support that, even if that makes our life quite a bit more complex.&#xA;As a reminder, we have the RavenDB Conference in Texas in a few months, which would be an excellent opportunity to learn about RavenDB 4.0 and the direction in which we are going.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The first thing you&#x2019;ll see when you run RavenDB 3.5 is the new empty screen:  You get the usual &#x201C;Create a database&#x201D; and the more interesting, Create Cluster. In RavenDB 3.0 clusters were ad hoc things, you created them by bridging together multiple nodes using replication. In RavenDB 3.5, we have made that into a first class concept. Clicking on the &#x201C;create cluster&#x201D; link will give you the following:  And then you can start adding additional nodes:  RavenDB cluster is using Raft (more specifically, Rachis, our Raft implementation) to bridge together multiple server into a single distributed consensus. This allows you to manage the entire cluster in one go.  Once you have created the cluster, you can always configure it (add / remove nodes) by clicking the cluster icon on the bottom.  Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm, which allows a group of server to agree on the order of a set of commands to execute (not strictly true, but for more details, see my previous&#xA0;posts in the topic).  We use Raft to connect server together, but what does this mean? RavenDB replication is still running in a multi master node, which means that each server can still accept requests. We use Raft for two distinct purposes. The first of which is to distribute changes of operations across the cluster. Adding a new database, changing a configuration settings. This allows to be sure that such changes are accepted by the cluster before they are actually performed. But the one that you&#x2019;ll probably notice most of all is that shown in the cluster image, Raft is a strong leader system, and we use it to make sure that all the writes in the cluster are done on the leader. If the leader is taken down, we&#x2019;ll transparently select a new leader, clients will be informed about it, and all new writes will go to the new leader. When the previous leader recover, it will join the cluster as a follower, and there will be no disruption of service.&#xA0; This is done for all the databases in the cluster, as you can see from the follow topology view:  Note that while the leader selection is handled via Raft, the leader database is replicating to the other nodes using multi-master system, so if you need to wait until a document is present in a majority of the cluster, you need to wait for write assurance. The stable leader in the presence of failure means that we won&#x2019;t have the clients switching back and forth between nodes, they will be informed of the leader, and stick to it. This generates a much more stable network environment, and allowing you to configure the cluster details once and have it propagate everywhere is a great reduction in operational work. I&#x2019;ll talk more about this in my next post in this series. As a reminder, we have the RavenDB Conference in Texas in a few months, where we&#x2019;ll present RavenDB 3.5 in all its glory.</p>
