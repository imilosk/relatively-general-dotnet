        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After a heoric struggle, I managed to get the local development story against MS CRM working. This means that I can use the normal semantics of develop locally and then deploy, instead of centralized development. That said, there is something very wrong in a solution that requires me to take action in the TCP stack level to get a normal development story going.</p>

There frameworks code is available all over the place, but DDD is often practiced inside a business app, which rarely has the source available.

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My post about two (PHP) code samples that I got from people that I interviewed got a lot of comments, so instead of answering them one by one, I am going to answer them here. The post had a two code samples, one from a coder with 8 years experience, the second from a sysadmin that wants to move to development. Suffice to say that the sample from the coder with 8 years under his belt is atrocious.  Mostly, the comments tended to be:  Why am I interviewing PHP programmers?My company is also doing head hunting / recruitment, interviewing people is part of the job.  The sysadmin code looks good on the surface, but it is has problems. (and then listing the problems, in many detailed and interesting ways).The sysadmin code is not perfect by any means, but it is structured, it shows basic understanding of how things work, and the rest can be handled. That guy can learn to write good code. That isn&#x27;t code that I would write, or would accept in my projects, but that is a very good start for the first steps.  But a lot of people said that the first code sample is a quick &amp; dirty solution to the problem at hand, some actually took offence at the idea. If I interview someone for a position that include working with code (in fact, if the CV include any programming language whatsoever), you write code, period. The reasoning is that there are plenty that can talk the talk, but literally can&#x27;t code.&#xA0;And looking at your code means that you get a lot of insight on how that person write code and how they think. Now, here is an observation, you tend to write code in the same way no matter in what scenarios you are. Writing sloppy code in an interview is something that is a strong indication for a sloppy coder. That is not the only indication that I use, but it is certainly a significant one. Given a choice between an experienced&#xA0;sloppy coder and an inexperienced&#xA0;one, I know who I would rather hire. Now, to those who claimed that such questions are insulting, I am usually trying to fit the question to the person that I am interviewing (so a team lead would get something more interesting), but the key thing to remember is that I am not looking at the solution itself, I am looking at everything that they have around that.  I want to say that code style isn&#x27;t something that I considering, but that would be a lie. I expect that the candidate would have some sort of a code style, and that it would be internally consistent. Beyond that, I don&#x27;t really care if it spaces vs. tabs and where the curly go. But if there isn&#x27;t a coding style that the candidate adheres to, that is something quite alarming.  Oh, and here is a secret that would make the argument more interesting, I don&#x27;t program in PHP. The last time that I had to use that was when I tried to modify a bug tracker in PHP, and that was about two and a half years ago (the dot operator for string concat drives me crazy).  Just to remind people, my purpose in posting that was to talk a bit the difference between &quot;experience&quot; and quality.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My last post made me think about how it is best to approach a problem in a dynamic environment. The problem that I have in mind is the one I solved with IoC and static typing here. The problem is as follows:  You have several customers, each of them has its own database, with its own schema, data and behaviors, There is a common ground between the customers, but each does (different things!) differently. You need to handle each incoming user according to its associated customer. For the purpose of discussion, let us say that we want to list all employees that are direct subordinates for the current user, where the employee&#x27;s names and their associations to their manager can change based on the customer. How would you approach such an issue using Ruby? This is not an idle question, I had to face such a task, and it is complex in the infrastructure layer, but still let me use clear, intention revealing code in most cases.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jacob Proffitt continues the DI discussion, and he opens with this:  Ayende Rahien responded individually to each of my posts himself, which is more than a little bit intimidating all on its own Despite rumors to the contrary, I want to mention that I abhor violence in all its forms. It always leads to having to fill forms in triplicate, and I got sick at that when they pulled form 34-C12 from the archives, just for me. Someone should remind me (on a non durable medium only) to demonstrate how you can get whatever you want, explicitly without violence in any form. It is both an interesting story, and it works. Now, to Jacob&#x27;s post, I will usually respond to things that I find interesting and rational, even if (or especially) if I do not agree.  All the heavyweight advocates of DI rely on powerful, relatively invasive tools to realize the benefits of Dependency Injection. Until you get those tools, the benefits of DI seem mainly theoretical. Actually.... *drums roll* no. Using DI with a container will certainly give you quite a few benefits, but you can get quite a bit from using DI directly. I met a guy in DevTeach which had done just that, with great success, using anonymous delegates and functional style. Nothing beyond a coding convention and what the language offered. As an aside, I would accept the powerful, but I reject the invasive tools part. An good IoC can and should be invisible to anything but the Main() method. (There are shortcuts that are easier to take if you are explicitly aware of the container, but it is most often used on naked CLR objects). The problem with DI, which is what the container want to solve, is that the moment you start injecting dependencies, you want some way to manage that, you can do that with a factory or a provider, but you get more benefits from using a container, since this allows you to centrally leverage some interesting concepts across the entire application.  If my client or company needs web pages that validate users against Active Directory and then allows them access to reports based on their group memberships, then telling me that I need some robust loose coupling framework in order to test my user maintenance library is flat out wrong. Hm, let us see...  public interface IAuthorozationService&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;bool Authenticate(string username, string password);&#xA;&#x9;bool AllowedTo(string action);&#xA;}&#xA;Simple, isn&#x27;t it? That is what we used on our last project, and that is what enabled us to switch the implementation from hard coded (used on the staging site) to database back-end (staging site, when doing it hard coded started to take too long) and to active directory (production).&#xA;If it takes you more than a minute to write that, there is an issue here. If you consider direct coupling to the Active Directory classes, then there is an issue. If you tell me that you can get he same thing from:&#xA;public static class AuthorizationProvider&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public static bool Authenticate(string username, string password)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//...&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public static bool AllowedTo(string action)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//...&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;}&#xA;Then I argue that there really isn&#x27;t any difference between the two, except that the interface based approach makes your collaborators easier to understand and work with. The second approach is a static Service Locator, which hides the dependency, but can do much the same as an IoC, but is more limited in terms of handling such things as life cycle.&#xA;&#xA;Outside of major corporate infrastructure projects, stringent loose coupling just isn&#x2019;t as much benefit as more naturally encapsulated OO techniques.&#xA;I strongly disagree, I find loose coupling to be an extremely useful idiom, important even in very small projects.&#xA0;The ability to look at a piece of code in isolation is a key factor for maintainability.&#xA;&#xA;So here we have a lot of architecture big wigs selling DI as best practices and not bothering to contextualize those statements at all. Again, Ayende is a good example of this. In Dependency Injection: More than a testing seam, he wraps up with &quot;Dependency Injection isn&#x2019;t (just) for testing, it is to Enable Change.&quot; Nice. So if I don&#x2019;t use DI, my projects can&#x2019;t change at all?&#xA;&#xA0;And here I was hoping to avoid a wig for the next two years at least.&#xA;I am very bad in debate tactics (see first paragraph for why), but I do believe that reversing a sentence and then attacking the reverse conclusion is not a fair tactic.&#xA;The ability to change the code is strictly a matter of the quality of the code, the amount of tight coupling, the amount of separation of concerns that you have there. DI or lack of DI doesn&#x27;t really into the equation on its own. You can certainly build DI-based projects that are impossible to change. &#xA;My argument is that DI is one of the tools that I use to make change possible. It is not the only one, naturally, and I am not saying it is the sole factor, but it is an important tool.&#xA;In addition to that, I don&#x27;t think that I have ever said that DI is good for everything and you should use it the next time you want to build a hello world program. Most of the advice that I tend to give (or that given by the people I respect) usually has the&#xA0;&quot;when applicable&quot; part.&#xA;&#xA;It all comes down to cost vs. benefit and that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m not seeing enough discussion of, here. What are the costs of using DI?&#xA;I think that the issues here are twofold, first, you see to significantly exaggerate the cost of using DI, out of proportion, I would say. The second is that you are trying to evaluate a part of the whole while refusing to consider the whole. DI is useful on its own, yes. It is much more useful when you have a container. There are different patterns for DI when you use a container and when you don&#x27;t, and there are different usage scenarios.&#xA;&#xA;Loose coupling is so far down my project priorities that standard OO practices are more than sufficient&#xA;Ookaaay.... so, according to you, this is a good approach?&#xA;public int GetCustomerCount()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;using(SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(Configuration.ConnectionString))&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;// ...&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;To me such code suffers from a numerous major issues, ranging from flexibility of implementation to performance concerns to transaction semantics.&#xA;&#xA;Only, everywhere I go for mock objects, I&#x2019;m being told that all the best projects are loosely coupled so what kind of incompetent fool am I for not implementing DI even before I ever thought of needing a mock object framework?&#xA;Jacob, in this case, consider this an official invitation to the Rhino Mocks mailing list, and a promise to ban anyone calling anyone else a fool or an incompetent.&#xA;Yes, mocks objects goes hand in hand with DI, because you need to get the mock behavior there. Yes, you can use TypeMock, but as far as I am concerned, the moment that I am doing that, I am in the same boat as I am when I am trying to test private methods. There is no need to do that.&#xA;&#xA;If I ever get into a project where loose coupling is a big enough concern that I have to consider seriously intrusive techniques in order to reduce the risks of dependency change,&#xA;Just to clarify, I find it hardly intrusive, and I am sadden to hear that you don&#x27;t consider loose coupling (which also means SoC) is important to the code base.&#xA;&#xA;Again, Ayende is an example of this attitude when he says, &quot;The main weakness of Type Mock is its power, it allow me to take shortcuts that I don&#x2019;t want to take, I want to get a system with low coupling and high cohesion.&quot; As a personal statement, I guess this is fine. If Ayende doesn&#x2019;t trust himself to write code appropriate to his requirements and resources, then by all means, he&#x2019;s free to handcuff himself with less powerful tools.&#xA;I appreciate your permission, but I think that you missed the point. My requirements are high cohesion and low coupling. In the end, I want code that I can read, understand and work with.&#xA;&#xA;That&#x2019;s not at all what he means, though. Too often this kind of statement isn&#x2019;t intended to actually target the speaker. The speaker is perfectly confident in their own abilities - in this case to create low coupling and high cohesion. It&#x2019;s the abilities of other developers they want to constrain. It&#x2019;s another manifestation of the &quot;programmers not doing things my way are idiots&quot; meme used against Visual Basic for so long.&#xA;I take offence at this statement. Rhino Mocks is a project that I developed because I wanted to have a mocking framework that I could deal with. It is an OSS project because I feel that other people can also use this functionality. It has never been my intention to use Rhino Mocks to preach My Way to the masses.&#xA;Nevertheless, Rhino Mocks reflect the way that I use a mocking framework, and the best practices that I and the community that has grown around it have discovered. I am using the same Rhino Mocks build as anyone else, for the same reason that I quoted above. This is not the case where I am handing down architecture to the stupid programmers down the hall: &quot;Thou Shall Have Loose Coupling, And That Will Be Enforced With Rhino Mocks&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Frankly, loose coupling isn&#x2019;t an absolute value anyway, so arguments that every decrease in coupling is automatically worth the cost are absurd on their face&#xA;Loose coupling comes with the cost of needing to understand the interactions within the system as a whole from the individual parts. I find that the ability to look at a piece of code in isolation, and then look at its interactions much easier than trying to grok a system that has tight coupling, since I can&#x27;t usually understand a piece of code is isolation. And, as always, it is entirely possible to have too much loose coupling.&#xA;To summarize this decidedly long post,</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Yesterday I had to interview two guys for a PHP job. One had about 8 years experience in programming (not just PHP) in general, one was a sysadmin. As usual, I ask interievees to solve some code excersize (in this case, save an email to the DB). That is the code that the guy with 8 years programming has written:&lt;?php&#xA;&#x9;$persone_name = $_POST[&quot;nm&quot;];&#xA;&#x9;$CityID = $_POST[&quot;ct_id&quot;];&#xA;&#x9;$message = $_POST[&quot;msg&quot;];&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;$cn = mySQL_connect(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,&quot;root&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;mysql_select_db(&quot;myDB&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;mysql_query(&quot;INSERT INTO tbl_data (persone_name,city_id,message) VALUES (&#x27;&quot; .   &#xA;&#x9;                                      $persone_name . &quot;&#x27;, &#x27;&quot; .$CityID . &#x27;&quot;,&#x27;&quot; .  $message . &quot;&#x27;&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;mysql_close($cn);&#xA;?&gt;&#xA;And here is the code that the sysadmin has written:&#xA;function save_to_db($host, $dbuser, $dbpassword, $dbname, $msg)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;//this function saves sent by parameters data to database&#xA;&#x9;$conn = new mysqli($host, $dbuser, $dbpassword, $dbname);&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;$id=NULL;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;//preparing a query&#xA;&#x9;$stmt= @$conn-&gt;prepare(&quot;INSERT INTO msg VALUES (?,? ,? ,? ,?)&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;if($stmt == FALSE)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;echo $conn-&gt;error;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;$conn-&gt;close();&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;//binding data&#xA;&#x9;$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&#x27;sssss&#x27;,$id,$msg[&#x27;from&#x27;],$msg[&#x27;to&#x27;],$msg[&#x27;subject&#x27;],$msg[&#x27;content&#x27;]);&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;//escaping strings to prevent a SQL injections&#xA;&#x9;foreach($msg as &amp;$item) {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;$item=$conn-&gt;real_escape_string($item);&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;// excuting a query&#xA;&#x9;$result=@$stmt-&gt;execute();&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;return $msg;&#xA;}&#xA;I got that code as the first thing that I saw when I opened my mail, and that was a good way to start the day.&#xA;I don&#x27;t think that I need to say who will get the job, right? And remember, the first one was written by someone with 8 years experience.&#xA;That is for the next time someone accuse me from despairing from the state of programmers on the market.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last week I spent about half a day trying to get WCF to reliabely work against Microsoft CRM web services. I had plenty of trouble just getting the authentication to work, which I blame solely on my lack of experience in configuring WCF. The problem is that it is literally four lines of code in ASMX, and configuration &#x2B; code in WCF, which you have to get just right. A big issue there was that authentication failure in the CRM services (ASMX, basically), will return an HTML page explaining the problem, and WCF was willing to give me just the first 1024 bytes of it. Resorting to black magic hackery to get the real error message is nasty, I am not sure what to blame here, but I would say that WCF is to blame here for not showing the full error message even in the trace logs. My current problem with this is that the response from the CRM looks something like this: &lt;RetrieveResult xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/crm/2006/WebServices&quot; xsi:type=&quot;account&quot;&gt; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;owningbusinessunit&gt;{50C57583-5F04-DC11-AF65-000C29955492}&lt;/owningbusinessunit&gt; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;ownerid name=&quot;Oren Eini&quot; dsc=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;systemuser&quot;&gt;{48D20A98-5F04-DC11-AF65-000C29955492}&lt;/ownerid&gt; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;name&gt;oren eini2&lt;/name&gt; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;accountid&gt;{8A1BBC3C-C44B-DC11-B6EF-000C292DA987}&lt;/accountid&gt; &lt;/RetrieveResult&gt; But WCF will return to me an object with all the fields set to null. The problem is that the result message has a lot more properties, and therefor, tags in it. The CRM web service appernatly pick and choose what it will send, and doesn&#x27;t bother to send empty tags for null proeprties. In the above message, the account entity has ~175 properties, so that is somewhat understandable. The problem is that there is no easy way to make WCF understand that. After running svcutil over the wsdl, I got a C# file that was 2MB (!!) in size, so manual intervention is out, and there seems to be no easy way to do globally. Playing with the options of svcutil also shows that WCF really doesn&#x27;t like that WSDL (in fact, it refused to generate DataContracts, instead relying on XML Serialization). Again, I am not really a WCF expert, but from&#xA0;my experiments, that&#xA0;may be possible, but it is complex, non-DRY, and not&#xA0;worth the trouble. I am using ASMX services now, which just works.</p>
