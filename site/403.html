            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I thought that I would stop a bit from focusing on what the LMDB code is doing in favor to some observations about the code itself. Going into this codebase it like getting hit in the face with a shovel. Now, this might be my personal experience, as someone who has done a lot of managed code work in the past. But I used to be a pretty horrible C/C&#x2B;&#x2B; guy (the fact that I say C/C&#x2B;&#x2B; should tell you exactly what my level was).  But I don&#x2019;t think that it was just that. Even beyond the fact that the code is C, and not C&#x2B;&#x2B; (which I am much more used to), there is a problem that only become clear to me well after I read the code for the millionth time. It grew. Looking at the way the code is structured, it looks like it was about as nice a C codebase as you can get (don&#x2019;t get excited, that isn&#x2019;t saying much). But overtime, features were added, but the general structure of the codebase wasn&#x2019;t adjusted to account for that. I am talking about things like this:         There are actually 22 (!) &#x2018;if(IS_LEAF(mp))&#x2019; references in the codebase. Or what about this?     It looks like certain features (duplicate keys support, for example) was added that had a lot of implication on the code, but it wasn&#x2019;t refactored accordingly. It make it very hard to go through.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I don&#x2019;t know if you noticed,&#xA0; but the LMDB codebase is giving me serious headache issues. The bloody thing is a very dense piece of code, but at the same time, it is also quite interesting. In particular, B-Trees are pretty much The Answer for a lot of on disk data structures, but they tend to be quite hard to handle properly. So I am looking forward to this piece of code, in which I am going to figure out if I can figure out this code. Just to note mdb_page_split is also another 400 lines method with goto sprinkled all over.  In order to do that, I wrote the following code (in a single transaction):  And then I spent another few minutes trying to get it to compile. Mostly because I started out with &#x201C;for (int i=0; &#x2026;&#x201D; and C doesn&#x2019;t allow that (blah!). Anyway, I got the page to split, and now I want to see how it actually behaves. I am currently at the first part where we take the root (currently leaf) page and turn it into a branch. This is an interesting case of a root split.  We start with:  And the first thing we do is to go to this mode:  We add an empty implicit pointer to the previous root. But this is really just the beginning, now we need to divide the entries that used to be in the root between the left &amp; right sides. This is made complex by the fact that you might have it setup so it has a few large &amp; small values, so just cutting them in the middle would produce a result that would be too big. At least, that is what a comment says. I am not sure how that can be. We are going from one page to two pages, so I don&#x2019;t see how you can get into a situation where that would happen. I guess it is time to slot into more code.  Okay, I got it, the issue is that we do a page split because we need to add a new item. So that is the reason we have to jump through those hops. Because we add a new item (that is already too big for the original page, since that is why we are actually splitting that). Another complex issue with page splits is that they might be recursive. If we need to split a page, we need to add an entry to the parent page, which might cause that page to split, etc&#x2026; An interesting observation on the sizes involved, a LMDB page has 4084 bytes available for storage. The data for the page number is 8 bytes long (it uses pointer size page number) and assuming keys that are 16 bytes keys in size (and including about 8 bytes for node header), we get about 128 keys per branch page. Even considering that B-Tree are specifically designed to make themselves efficient in the presence of memory hierarchies, it is&#xA0; quite impressive. Consider, assuming a full tree, if we hold just the root and the first level in memory, we would consume about 512kb. And that would give us just one seek to get any of ~2 million items. As an aside, one reason that I like reading this code is that for once, this is a B-Tree implementation that isn&#x2019;t covered in locking code, which is how this is usually works in RDBMS.  Another aspect that is quite interesting is that this code really shows important aspects for working with relational databases. It is all about keeping things inside the same page, with spill over to overflow pages slowing things down because you need to do another seek. Or a really obvious explanation why page splits are such a bad thing, and a lot of other details that you learn when you go a bit deep into relational databases but (at least for me) have never been real before I started dealing with building databases myself.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got a lot of criticism about the posts talking about the interview process. A lot of &#x201C;just be nice&#x201D;, &#x201C;you should give them a chance&#x201D;, &#x201C;how could you say that&#x201D;, and a lot of stuff like that. To those guys, wake up and smell the corpse.&#xA0; Let us call the Zombie on the keyboard Boris. Yes, I know the doll looks female. But for our purposes it is a Zombie female named Boris. I hired Boris at the end of 2011. She was hired for a junior position in HR after some doubts on my parts. Mainly, she didn&#x2019;t shine in the hiring process, but we really needed the additional manpower, and she didn&#x2019;t have anything that was an immediate NO. Just nothing that made me want to say an immediate YES. We started Boris using pretty much the same way we start junior devs, learning the ropes by doing some non essential tasks. In Boris&#x2019; case, that was done by building the public daily builds site for us. I thought it was a good way to getting started, it meant getting surface familiarity with RavenDB, and it was something that we needed. By the way, we have since then replaced that site, don&#x2019;t bother looking for that. Boris needed a lot of help at first, but that was natural for a new hire, especially a junior one. We spent quite a bit of time with her, showing her the ropes, how things work, etc. But it took her a long time to do things, and in the end, it was quite apparent that it would be easier to do things myself than tell Boris to do them. If I did things myself, it would be done. If I told Boris to do them, I would have to explain what I wanted, come over and help several times, come over again and fix the broken pieces. Explain some more about what was wrong, and finally pretty much write it myself. Now, that is something that I am perfectly fine with, for the first two times. The third and forth times, maybe. But if you don&#x2019;t get what is going on after a few explanation, there are two options. Either Boris couldn&#x2019;t get it, or I wasn&#x2019;t explaining things in a way Boris could get it. Either way, it didn&#x2019;t matter, Boris didn&#x2019;t get it. And even assuming that the fault lie in me, which I am absolutely willing to do. That didn&#x2019;t really matter. About 3 months after we hired her, Boris was let go with our best wishes, but without any regrets. In fact, my major regret was letting it go for so long, because I really didn&#x2019;t want to admit that Boris was a bad fit. Now, let us review what Boris cost us:  3 months of salary &amp; benefits.  Not hiring someone else that could have done better.  Quite a lot of my and the other guys&#x2019; time.  It doesn&#x2019;t really matter how you spin it, Boris was a huge net loss for us. Not theoretical &#x201C;I could have that&#x201D; loss, but a real measurable loss that set us back by quite a bit. On the other hand, we have had a recruiting cycle that didn&#x2019;t pan out. The end result that we didn&#x2019;t get anyone. Net loss, purely theoretical from our part. We reached out to a partner and got help from known good people. What I think is crucial to understand is that I actually have access to a really good group of people that I can work with. Most of them are remote, and most of them are only available for part of the time. But getting really good people, and I mean awesome people, of the kind that &#x201C;you just blew my mind&#x201D; people is not a big deal. I have access to them, and if I have enough work for that level of talent, I can probably get them for several months of pure work. I don&#x2019;t shy around or talk behind people&#x2019;s back, and when I tell you that they have world&#x2019;s class talent. I mean it. When I am looking for local people, I am looking for people that can compete with that level of talent. Because remote work is useful and great, but it ain&#x2019;t the same. And that is why every now and then we do a recruiting cycle, to see if we can find people that match our expectations. In other words, the cost of making a bad hire would be money and time (much more costly!) down the drain. The cost of not making a hire is having to rely on good people that might live in a different timezone or take vacations on a strange schedule.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The posts about our interviews seems to have strike a nerve in some people. So I thought I would respond here to all the comments at once. Some stats about our hiring process:  We worked with 2 recruitment agencies, looking for a 5&#x2B; years experience in C#/.NET, Server Side work, OSS experience / NoSQL experience, multi threading, TCP/IP, REST&#x2026;  We got 23 CVs to review, and did phone interviews for most of them.  We actually interviewed 9 candidates, had 3 potential hires and made an offer to 2 of them. Unprofessional &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t know about you, but a large part of running a business is finding good people. And having people that are severely under qualified show up is a problem. In the same way that I talk about problems in code or silly patterns or horrible processes, the part about hiring people is just as important. I am quite careful about not giving away any details, but that is about it. I&#x2019;ve had people comment that I am gloating. But nothing could be further from the truth, if anything, those are mournful posts. Because if that is the state of the industry&#x2026; Those are insulting questions &#x2013; a few people said that they thought that the questions were insulting. Look at the numbers, we had two thirds of the people fail to answer them. I had a candidate with 13&#x2B; years of experience who looked quite promising get up and leave mid interview because the candidate couldn&#x2019;t solve a string sort problem with full internet access. I had people submit code that made my eyes bleed.&#xA0; And I think that people don&#x2019;t understand something about those questions. The coding questions won&#x2019;t get you hired. The coding questions are there to keep you from getting hired. The assumption is that you should be able to solve those questions blindfolded while dancing the cha-cha and typing with your left earlobe.  Due to the large number of people who can talk the talk but not walk the walk, I am assuming all candidates incompetent until proven otherwise. And yes, I absolutely agree that this is a sad state of affairs. Those are not relevant questions &#x2013; &#x201C;In these days on the Internet, I&#x27;m not at all sure I do care someone knows how to sort a string.&#x201D; Well, we are building databases, we actually care quite a lot about things like sorting. But leaving that aside, we don&#x2019;t actually care how you do the sorting. Most candidate uses List&lt;T&gt;.Sort, and that was fine. But I think that the key point is, if you have internet access and an hour, and you can&#x2019;t implement a sort algorithm, you don&#x2019;t get to work here. You should be mentoring them, not discouraging them &#x2013; I think that someone just missed a turn in the road to reality. I didn&#x2019;t show up at a Teach Kids to Program and laughed at their inability to do three stars code. I was conducting interviews for a senior position. That meant that I was limiting candidates to 5&#x2B; years experience. Actually going through the interview process cost us. A lot. It effectively shut us down for a day or two, and took about three full days just to do the interviews.&#xA0; There is a serious cost here.  And having people that are drastically unqualified show up and take our time is a very costly waste. Look at the number above. Out of 23 people, I posted about 3, because they crossed all the limits that I can think of. In contrast, we had a bunch of other people we talked to or even interviewed that didn&#x2019;t make the cut for being potential hires. They weren&#x2019;t bad by any means, but they just weren&#x2019;t what we were looking for. I am not sorry, if you don&#x2019;t show up ready to answer stuff that a first year student should be able to, you are cheating. Certainly me, and probably yourself. At that point, I&#x2019;m going to stop wasting my time and move on to more productive avenues.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As mentioned, the data in LMDB is actually stored in page. And I am currently tracking through the process in which we add a new item to the database. The first thing that happen is that we allocate a leaf page. I think that I&#x2019;ll have to go over how pages are allocated now, which should explain a lot about how LMDB reuses disk space. A new page is allocated by first finding the oldest transaction that is still active. This is how LMDB implements MVCC. Basically, any free page that is older than any existing transaction is eligible for reuse. The first db (although a better term would be to call it btree, or maybe a table) contains the free pages, and at first we search there for an available page. If we can&#x2019;t find such a page, we use the end of the file for that. This happens in mdb_page_alloc. An very interesting aspect is the fact that LMDB allows direct memory writes (with the additional risk of corrupting the db if you messed the data), interestingly, this is done in the following code:  If the options allows directly memory writes, you get a point to the mmap file. Otherwise, LMDB will allocate a page (or re-use one that has already been allocated). I am not really sure what is going on with the insert yet. This is a function pointer (delegate for C#). And it select which behavior will happen later on. I am just not sure what those two different function do yet. I think I got it, the key is here:  You can see that we use the insert method to add the mid variable to the dirty list. So if we give you a direct pointer, we append it to the list. But if we give you allocate a page, we need to add it in order.  The mdb_mid2l_insert will add an item to the list in the appropriate location to ensure sorting. I think that this is done so when we actually write the dirty page to disk, if we do that using file I/O, we will do that in ascending file order, so we can get good seek times from the disk. A new page has 4,084 bytes available for it (12 bytes are taken by header data).  A database is actually created the first time data is written to it. The root page is allocated and recorded. And then the data is added to the page. As you might recall, data inside a page is kept in a sorted list. But remember that the data is also stored on the page, and there is the whole notion of overflow pages, so I think that I am going to have to draw a picture to figure out what is going on.  This is more or less how it works. But I don&#x2019;t think that I really get it. Note that there are two collections here. First is the positions of nodes in the page, and the second is the node themselves. The reason we have this complexity is that we need to maintain both of them in an efficient manner. And we need to do that without too much copying. Therefor, the list of nodes in the page is in the beginning, growing downward, and the actual nodes are in the end, growing upward. The page is full when you can&#x2019;t fit anything between those two lists. A node, by the way, is the LMDB internal name for a key (and maybe data). But I think that I might have an error here, because I don&#x2019;t see the code here to actually add nodes to the page in a sorted fashion, so it might be doing linear search on the content of a node. I am not tracking through the code for adding a second value into a database. And I think that I have to be wrong about linear node search. The code I was looking at was invoked at the the new db creation section, so it might be taking shortcuts that aren&#x2019;t generally available. At any rate, the logic for adding an item goes like this&#x2026; first we need to find the appropriate page. And we do this by starting from the root and asking for the actual page. Which gets us to mdb_page_get, where we have the following:  The really interesting part here is that each transaction have a dirty list of pages, so if you modified a page, you&#x2019;ll get your own version, even before the data was committed. Otherwise, we will just hand you the current version. This is quite nice.  And then we get to the already familiar mdb_page_search_root function, and I can confirm that the nodes in a page are actually sorted, which only make sense. I am not sure where that happens yet, but I have got the feeling that I am going to see that in a bit. Okay, I am going to go on a bit of a rant here, mostly against C, to be honest.  Take a look at this code. mdb_page_search does something, but what it does it mutate the state for the cursor (mc), and you are then going to access the mc-&gt;mc_pg[mc-&gt;mc_top] to get the actual result you wanted. To make things more interesting, the is also a mc-&gt;mc_ki, which is the index of the node inside the node. And it drove me crazy, because I just couldn&#x2019;t see the association between those three values, especially because I am so not used to this type of code that I never even considered this as a possibility. At any rate, now I know how it gets to insert things in the right order. When doing mdb_page_search, it calls to mdb_node_search, which does the appropriate setup to tell the next call where it need to actually do the insert to get things in a sorted fashion. I am currently in the mdb_cursor_put, which is trice cursed and really hard to follow. A 400&#x2B; lines method with gotos galore.  But I am in the section where we are actually going to be writing a new value. (new_sub: goto header, if you care). And the code is pretty straight forward from there. Next up, I want to see how it handles a page split, but that is a subject to another post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, I just finished interviewing a candidate. His CV states that he has been working professionally for about 6 years or so. The initial interview was pretty well, and the candidate was able to talk well about his past experience. I tend to do a generic &#x201C;who are you?&#x201D; section, then give them a couple of questions to solve in front of Visual Studio, an architecture question and then a set of technical questions that test how much the candidate knows. Mostly, I am looking to get an impression about the candidate, since that is all I usually have a chance to do in the span of the interview. The following is a section from the code exercise that this candidate has completed: for (int i = 0; i &lt; sortedArrLst.Count; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;{&#xA;    if (sortedArrLst[i].Contains(escapeSrt[0]))&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (sortedArrLst[i].IndexOf(escapeSrt[0]) == 0)&#xA;        {&#xA;            sortedArrLst[i] = sortedArrLst[i].Remove(0, escapeSrt[0].Length&#x2B;1);&#xA;            escapeStrDic.Add(sortedArrLst[i], escapeSrt[0]);&#xA;        }&#xA;        &#xA;    }&#xA;    if (sortedArrLst[i].Contains(escapeSrt[1]))&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (sortedArrLst[i].IndexOf(escapeSrt[1]) == 0)&#xA;        {&#xA;            sortedArrLst[i] = sortedArrLst[i].Remove(0, escapeSrt[1].Length&#x2B;1);&#xA;            escapeStrDic.Add(sortedArrLst[i], escapeSrt[1]);&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Thank you, failure to use loops will get your disqualified from working at us.&#xA;Then there were the gems such as &#x201C;mutex is a kind of state machine&#x201D; and &#x201C;binary search trees are about recursion&#x201D; or the &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll use perfmon to solve a high CPU usage problem in production&#x201D;.&#xA;Then again, the next candidate after that was quite good. Only 4 &#x2013; 6 to go now.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It is that time again, we are looking for more developers. And this time I ended up so pissed after an interview I had to call a sick colleague just to vent. One candidate I ruled out early during the interview process. It was a somewhat sinking sensation in the pit of my stomach as I spoke with the candidate, and I couldn&#x2019;t get a single actually technical description about what the candidate is actually doing now. A lot of broad descriptions, and a lot of sweeping statements, but no real technical details. But the candidate did know jQuery mobile back &amp; forth, it appears. The decision was made final when I asked the candidate what web framework they were using. I asked whatever they were using ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET MVC or ASP.Net Web API. Note that from my perspective, it is a list in a ascending worth order, and you you are using something not on it, that is a plus (it means you aren&#x2019;t just using whatever is available, which is nice). So I was quite excited when the candidate said (confusedly) &#x201C;none of them&#x201D;. Then it took me putting on my investigative hat and asking a lot of questions about how they are actually doing things before it finally came out that they were doing ASPX. Not knowing the name of the environment in which you are working with for the past several years&#x2026; I am not sure what to call it. At least the candidate was able to let me know how they were using that in great detail. We do stuff in Page_Init, then we have&#xA0; a method that load the data from the database and put it in the ViewState or the Session, then we bind it to a grid, and most of the code is in the grid event handlers. I am sure that the candidate is a great web developer, but I would rather that this particular candidate be great at another location. The second candidate actually passed our phone screen and was invited to an interview. We have a fairly basic interview process. Some background information for both sides, then a few questions that you need to solve in Visual Studio (and yes, you have full MSDN &amp; Google access) and then a technical portion of the interview that include a system design and a more detailed set of technical knowledge questions. Now, I am sure that you have heard about interesting interview questions like sort a 100 GB file in a machine 32 bits with 512MB of memory. I admit that something like that would be challenging and interesting. I would probably quite enjoy seeing how people deal with that.  That is not the type of questions that we ask. I asked for a &#x201C;sort these strings&#x201D; and a &#x201C;calculate this tax&#x201D; programs. I gave the candidate about an hour and a half, alone in a room with VS and internet connection. I am not even asking to implement your own sort, just customize the comparison function and run the standard .NET sort. And do some basic math. The candidate was unable to finish either problem on the time allotted. Now, to be fair for the candidate, the way he solved the first problem was correct and much better than many other attempts that I have seen. Note that the issue was an IComparable&lt;string&gt; instead of IComparable&lt;Item&gt; that caused the issue. It is subtle and something that I would expect an newbie to catch. But this candidate came with full 6 years of experience.  Okay, I said to myself, it is natural to be nervous when doing interviews, let us see what the candidate knows beyond that. The CV mentioned that work with mutli threading. So I began with some questions about that. But it appears that &#x201C;I only know Thread and BackgroundWorker&#x201D;. But the absolute clincher was when I asked the candidate about what would cause a high CPU problem and how to diagnose that: &#x201C;Well, I think that there are special tools that will tell you which process is using the CPU&#x2026;&#x201D; Special tools? Well, I guess Task Manager can be called special, but I am not really sure that I would call it that .And if your experience in troubleshooting stuff never go to the point where you actually look at Task Manager to see what is going on&#x2026; it probably means that you don&#x2019;t have meaningful experience in actually troubleshooting stuff.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, I know that I have been critical about the LMDB codebase so far. But one thing that I really want to point out for it is that it was pretty easy to actually get things working on Windows. It wasn&#x2019;t smooth, in the sense that I had to muck around with the source a bit (hack endianess, remove a bunch of unix specific header files, etc). But that took less than an hour, and it was pretty much it. Since I am by no means an experienced C developer, I consider this a major win. Compare that to leveldb, which flat out won&#x2019;t run on Windows no matter how much time I spent trying, and it is a pleasure.  Also, stepping through the code I am starting to get a sense of how it works that is much different than the one I had when I just read the code. It is like one of those 3D images, you suddenly see something. The first thing that became obvious is that I totally missed the significance of the lock file. LMDB actually create two files:  lock.mdb data.mdb Lock.mdb is used to synchronized data between different readers. It seems to mostly be there if you want to have multiple writers using different processes. That is a very interesting model for an embedded database, I&#x2019;ve to admit. Not something that I think other embedded databases are offering. In order to do that, it create two named mutexes (one for read and one for write).  A side note on Windows support: LMDB supports Windows, but it is very much a 2nd class citizen. You can see it in things like path not found error turning into a no such process error (because it try to use GetLastError() codes as C codes), or when it doesn&#x2019;t create a directory even though not creating it would fail. I am currently debugging through the code and fixing such issues as I go along (but no, I am doing heavy handed magic fixes, just to get past this stage to the next one, otherwise I would have sent a pull request). Here is one such example. Here is the original code:  But ReadFile in Win32 will return false if the file is empty, so you actually need to write something like this to make the code work:  Past that hurdle, I think that I get a lot more about what is going on with the way LMDB works than before. Let us start with the way data.mdb works. It is important to note that for pretty much everything in LMDB we use the system page size. By default, that is 4KB.  The data file starts with 2 pages allocated. Those page contain the following information:  Looking back at how CouchDB did things, I am pretty sure that those two pages are going to be pretty important. I am guess that they would always contain the root of the data in the file. There is also the last transaction on them, which is what I imagine determine how something gets committed. I don&#x2019;t know yet, as I said, guessing based on how CouchDB works. I&#x2019;ll continue this review in another time. Next time, transactions&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, I now have a pretty rough idea about how the codebase actually works. I still think that the codebase is quite ugly. For example, take a look at this: The len parameter for CreateFile is whatever to open or create or just open (read only). But why is it in a parameter called len?  Probably because it was just there, and it would be a sin to create another local variable just for this, I guess (in a codebase where a method had &gt; 18 local variables!).&#xA0; To make things more interesting, in the rest of this method, this is actually a string len variable, sigh. At any rate, let us actually dig deeper now. The following structure is holding data about a db.  This is actually somewhat misleading, at least with regards to how I would think about a db. This is the entry point for all the pages that belong to a specific db. But a db in LMDB is not really the same thing as a db in SQL Server or RavenDB. It all reside in the same file, and you always have at least two. The first one is the free db, which is used to track all the free pages. The second one is the main db. Then you have additional, named databases.  This is used here:  This define the metadata for the entire environment. Note that we have the two dbs there in mm_dbs. The mm_txnid denotes the last committed transaction id. This value is what gives LMDB its MVCC support.&#xA0; The mm_last_pg value is the last used page, any transaction that wants to write will start writing at that value.  Let us see how we deal with pages here, shall we?  The first part find try to find a dirty page if we are in a read/write transaction and we haven&#x2019;t specify that we can write directly to memory. This is done by doing a binary search on the list of dirty pages.  Otherwise, we can just hand the user the actual page by accessing it directly. Next, let us look where this is actually used. Searching for a page with a specific key in it. This is done mostly in mdb_node_search.   This seems to be doing a binary search for the keys inside a specific page (in this case, the page that is at the top of the stack on the cursor). That leads to the conclusion that pages internally have data internally stored as sorted arrays. And this leads me to another pet peeve with this code base. Take a look at this line:  Sure, this is a well known trick to cheaply divide&#xA0; a number by half, but are you seriously telling me that the compiler isn&#x2019;t going to optimize&#xA0; (low &#x2B; high) / 2 ? To my knowledge, no C compiler updated in the last 10 &#x2013; 15 years managed to miss this optimization. So why write code that is going to be harder to read? Okay, so now we know how we search for a specific key inside a page, but how do we get to the actual page that we want to search on? This happens on mdb_page_search_root. Let me see if I can take it apart. When this method is called, the cursor is setup so the first page on the pages stack is the root page.&#xA0;  And&#x2026; that is enough for me. Up until now, I have been trying to just read the code. Not execute it, not debug through it, nothing .Just go over the code one line at a time and figure out what is going on. I actually think that I have a really good grasp about what is going on in there, but I think that this is pretty much all I can do at that point from just reading the code. So I am going to stop now and setup an debug environment so I can work with it, and report my finding from stepping through the code.</p>
