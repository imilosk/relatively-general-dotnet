            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;ve been using Lucene for the past six or seven years, and after my last post, I thought it would be a good idea to talk a bit about the kind of things that it isn&#x2019;t doing well. We&#x2019;ve been using it extensively in RavenDB for the past 5 years, and I think that I have a pretty good understanding of it. We used to have one of Lucene.NET committers working at Hibernating Rhinos, so I&#x2019;ve a high level of confidence that I&#x2019;m not just stupidly not using it properly, too. Probably the part that caused us the most pain with Lucene was the fact that it isn&#x2019;t transactional. That is, it is quite easy to get into situations where the indexes are corrupted. That make it&#x2026; challenging to use it in a database that needs to ensure consistency. The problem is that it is really not a use case that Lucene is well suited for. In order to ensure that data is saved, we have to commit often, the problem is that in order to ensure good performance, we want to commit less often, but then we will the changes if we crash. For that matter, Lucene doesn&#x2019;t do any attempt to actually flush the data properly, relying on the OS to do that, a system crash can cause you to lose data even though you &#x201C;committed&#x201D; it.  Fun times, I can tell you that. Next, we have the issue of what Lucene call updates. Updates in Lucene are actually just delete/add, and they don&#x2019;t maintain the same document id (more on that later). Because of that, you usually have to have an additional field in the index that would be your primary key, and you handle updates by first deleting then adding things. That is quite strange, to be fair, and it means that you can&#x2019;t &#x201C;extend&#x201D; an index entry, you have to build it from scratch every time. Speaking of this, let us talk a bit about deletes. Ignoring for the moment the absolutely horrendous decision to do deletes through the reader, let us talk about how they are actually done. Deletes are recorded in a separate file, and that means that the moment you have any deletes (or, as I mentioned, updates), all the internal statistics are wrong.&#xA0; We run into this quite often with RavenDB when we are doing things like facets or suggestions. For example, if you have request a suggestion for a user name, it will happily give you suggestions for deletes users, even though we deleted it in Lucene. It will go away eventually, when it is ready to optimize the index by merging all the files, but in the meantime, it makes&#xA0; for interesting bug reports.&#xA0; Speaking of merging, that is another common issue that you have to deal with. In order to ensure optimal performance, you have to be on top of the merge policy. This results in some interesting issues. For RavenDB&#x2019;s purposes, we do a writer commit after every indexing batch. That means that if you are writing to RavenDB slowly enough, we do a commit after every document write. That result in a lot of segments, and the merge policy would have to do a lot of merges. The problem here is that merges have two distinct costs associated with them. First, and obviously, you are going to need to write (again) all of the documents in all of the segments you are merging. That is very similar to doing merges in LevelDB ( indeed, in general Lucene&#x2019;s file format is remarkably similar to SST ). Next, and arguably more interesting / problematic from our point of view is the fact that it also kills all of the caches. Let me try to explain, Lucene uses a lot of caches to speed things up, in fact, most of the sorting is done by using the caches, for example.&#xA0; That works really well when we are querying normally, because segments are immutable, which makes for great caching. But on a merge, not only have we just invalidate all of our caches, we now need to read, again, all of the data that we just wrote, so we would be able to use it. That can be&#x2026; costly. And both things can introduce stalls into the system. The major problem externally with merges is that the document id changes, and that means that you cannot rely on them. It would be much easier if you could send an id out into the world, and get it back later and do something with it, but that isn&#x2019;t possible with Lucene. Next, and not really an operational issue like the rest, Lucene&#x2019;s multi threaded behavior is&#x2026; a hammer to an egg, in most cases. By that I mean code like this:  I mean, it is certainly functional, but it is pretty ugly.  Now, don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I think that Lucene is pretty neat. But there are some really dark corners there. For example, the actual searching, go ahead and try to find where that is done in Lucene. It is very easy to get lost between all of the different aspects: weights, sorters, queries and various enumerators. For fun, a lot of that runs at hard to figure out times, making the actual query run time interesting to try to figure out. As a good example, let us take the simplest possible query, TermQuery. Go ahead, try to find where it is actually doing the query for matching terms in this code: https://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/LUCENE_2_1/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/TermQuery.java That actually happens here: https://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/LUCENE_2_1/src/java/org/apache/lucene/search/TermScorer.java#L79, and it is effectively a side effect of calling reader.termDocs(term) that limit the matches only to those with the same term.&#xA0; Trying to track down where exactly things happen can be&#x2026; interesting. Anyway, this post is getting to long, and I want to get back to figuring out how Lucene does its thing without dwelling too much in the dark&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Lucene is a search engine library, which is great. But as it turns out, there is a lot going on there. After working with it for several years, I can say with confidence that it is a pretty awesome library. But surprisingly, a lot of the effort that went into it doesn&#x2019;t seem to be talked about / visible to people not trolling through the code. I think that this is a pretty good testament for how successful it is. That, and the fact that it is now the base line against which all other search libraries &amp; engines are compared.  What I wanted to talk about today was the kind of things that Lucene is doing that doesn&#x2019;t seem to get much publicity. I think that Spolsky said it best:  Back to that two page function. Yes, I know, it&#x27;s just a simple function to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and nobody knows why. Well, I&#x27;ll tell you why: those are bug fixes. One of them fixes that bug that Nancy had when she tried to install the thing on a computer that didn&#x27;t have Internet Explorer. Another one fixes that bug that occurs in low memory conditions. Another one fixes that bug that occurred when the file is on a floppy disk and the user yanks out the disk in the middle. That LoadLibrary call is ugly but it makes the code work on old versions of Windows 95. I remember just how much impact that article made on me at the time. And Lucene&#x2019;s codebase bear true for this words. Lucene is a search engine library, which basically means that it does:  Indexing Querying Maintenance One of the major areas of maturity in Lucene is how it optimized indexing. You can see it in the code. For example, Lucene goes to a great deal of trouble to avoid allocating memory willy nilly. Instead, pretty much everything there is done via object pools. This helps reduce the memory pressure when doing a lot of indexing and can save a lot of GC cycles.  Another is the concept of multiple threads for indexing .A lot of Lucene is build around this idea, it has a lot of per thread state that is meant to ensure that you don&#x2019;t have to deal with concurrency yourself. The idea is that you can take an IndexWriter and write to it concurrently, then call commit. A lot of the work to do with indexing is CPU intensive, so that makes a lot of sense, and Lucene nicely isolates you from all of that work. There is DocumentWriterPerThread, so you can see really nice scaling effects as you throw more threads &amp; hardware at the problem. Usually, when people start messing with Lucene, they do that by writing analyzers, and you are sort of exposed to the memory constraints by being encourage to use ReusableTokenStream, etc. It has also a nice pipeline architecture for doing the indexing work with filters. On the querying side, Lucene does a lot of work to ensure that things just works. It has a Boolean Model for searches, and Vector Space Model for ranking. Writing your own Query classes is pretty easy too, once you understand how things work, and again, this is another common place for people to extend Lucene. But there is a lot going on behind the scenes. Lucene does a lot of caching on a segment basis, and it is quite nice, since segments are immutable, it means that you can get pretty good usage out of that.  That give it a lot of its speed, and it means that over time, things are actually going to be faster, because more parts of the segments are in memory and cached.  Finally, we have all of the other work that Lucene does. In practice, it means things like merging segments (hopefully in the background), and keeping the overall system humming along. Unfortunately, that is also one of the places that are usually most common for people to start tinkering with when they run into perf problems. That is anything but trivial, and optimizing it is something that require a lot of expertise and understanding about the specific scenario you have. And on top of that, you have everything else that already works on top of Lucene. Which is quite a lot. As I said earlier, that is a very impressive piece of technology. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that it doesn&#x2019;t have its own set of problems, but that is something that I&#x2019;ll discuss in detail in my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I talked about the Lucene formula and how it calculate things using tf-idf for best matches. Now I want to talk about the actual sorting implementation. As it turned out, the default sorting (by relevancy) is really simple. All you need is to get the relevant score for a query, then you shove the results through a heap with a specified size. The heap will take care of maintain the top results. So far, that is pretty simple to understand. But the question is, how do you do sorting on a field value? The answer is, not easily.  GetStringIndex() does something very interesting. I returns&#xA0; a string index, which gives us:  A string array containing all the distinct (sorted) value for this index. A int array with all the documents in the index, with the position of the value of that field in the string value array Now we can compare fields by their field position on the field, which give us pretty good sorting. Unfortunately, this also require us to load all the values to memory. Let us see another example, which would probably be easier to follow: Sorting by an integer is done like this:  Get an array (whose size match the number of documents),&#xA0; We can then sort things easily because accessing the relevant field value only require us to have the document id to index into the array. The reason Lucene does this is that it uses an inverted index, and it has no easy way of going from the field values to the list documents it has. So it is easier to read all the values into memory and work with them there. I don&#x2019;t like it, but off hand, I can&#x2019;t think of a better way to handle this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Now that the conference is over ,and I am merely doing 3 back to back RavenDB courses in 3 cities and 2 continents, I can sit back and look at that. I was, in a word, a blast. We had eight speakers giving 14 talks, about topics that moved from date and time handling in RavenDB to operational concerns to architectural how to. But, to be honest, I think that I found the attendees to be the main attraction. It was really good to finally meet so many of the people we have been talking with over the past few years. And what people are building with RavenDB is flat out amazing, and just a little bit scary. It is a funny thing when I see people take our tool and put it to uses that we have never even imagined. Another great part was the hackaton. We had, in the space of a few hours, produced a major new feature for RavenDB (distributed counters), with everything wired up: Storage, Wire Protocol and even the UI. We still need to complete the replication bits, but those are coming. We have recorded the sessions, and we hope to have the edited videos soon. I wanted to take the time and thank the speakers and the attendees for such a great conference . We&#x2019;ll be seeing you again soon&#x2026; .</p>

This is now 01:30 AM for the next day, and I am still stoked.  I took this picture at around 8 AM, when people started to queue up to go into the conference:  For that matter, you can see a few other photos from the conference here. I&#x2019;ll do a retrospect about the conference when I have time to breath. But for now, I can report that the RavenDB Hackaton was quite a success, we have a cool new feature mostly implemented. You can see it here: https://github.com/ayende/ravendb/tree/duco And yes, I&#x2019;ll talk about that in the future as well. But right now, I&#x2019;m going to have a db capable of managing a 100 billion records tomorrow, live on stage, so I probably need to get some sleep done&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The basis of how Lucene work is tf&#x2013;idf, short for term frequency&#x2013;inverse document frequency. You can read about it here. It is pretty complex, but it is explained in detailed in the Lucene docs. It all fall down to:  For now, I want to look at the tf() function. The default implementation is in DefaultSimilarity.Tf, and is defined as:  That isn&#x2019;t really helpful, however. Not without knowing what freq is.&#xA0; And I&#x2019;m pretty sure that Sqrt isn&#x2019;t cheap, which probably explains this:  So it caches the score function, and it appears that the tf() is purely based on the count, not on anything else. Before I&#x2019;ll go and find out what is done with the score cache, let&#x2019;s look at the weight value. This is calculated here:  And idf stands for inverse document frequency.&#xA0; That is defined by default to be:  And the actual implementation as:  And the caller for that is:  So, we get the document doc frequency of a term, that is, in how many documents this term shows, and the number of all the documents, and that is how we calculate the idf. So far, so good. But how about that doc frequency? This is one of the things that we store in the terms info file. But how does that get calculated? I decided to test this with:  This should generate 3 terms, two with a frequency of 1 and one with a frequency of 2. Now, to figure out how this is calculated. That part is a real mess.  During indexing, there is a manually maintained hash table that contains information about each unique term, and when we move from one document to another, we write the number of times each term appeared in the document. For fun, this is written to what I think is an in memory buffer for safe keeping, but it is really hard to follow. Anyway, I now know enough about how that works for simple cases, where everything happens in a single segment. Now let us look what happens when we use multiple segments. It is actually quite trivial. We just need to sum the term frequency each term across all segments. This gets more interesting when we involve deletes. Because of the way Lucene handle deletes, it can&#x2019;t really handle this scenario, and deleting a document do not remove its frequency counts for the terms that it had. That is the case until the index does a merge, and fix everything that way. So now I have a pretty good idea about how it handled the overall term frequency. Note that this just gives you the number of times this term has been seen across all documents. What about another important quality, the number of times this term appears in a specific document? Those are stored in the frq file, and they are accessible during queries. This is then used in conjunction with the overall term frequency to generate the boost factor per result.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing my trip into the Lucene codebase, now I&#x2019;m looking into the process indexing are happening. Interestingly enough, that is something that we never really had to look at before. It is quite clear that Lucene is heavily meant for utilizing additional threads for improving overall indexing speed. You can see it in the number of per thread state that exist all over the indexing code. That is also meant to reduce memory consumption, as far as I can see.   The real stuff happens in the ProcessDocument() where we have a chain of DocFieldConsumerPerThread and TermsHashConsumerPerThread which actually do the work. Then the real work is happening on a per field level in DocInverterPerField, where the analyzer is actually called. The process in which the analyzers return values for the text is interesting. There are &#x201C;attributes&#x201D; that are added to the stream, per token, and they are used to get the relevant values. I assume that this allows to have different levels of analyzers.  This way, you can have analyzers that don&#x2019;t deal with offesets or positions, etc. And the actual processing of this is done in a chain that appears to be:  Freq Prox Term Vectors  But that isn&#x2019;t something that I really care about now. I want to see how Lucene writes the actual terms. This is being written in the TermsInfoWriter, which took some time to find.  Terms are stored in a prefix compressed mode (sorted, obviously), and there is the actual terms, and an index into the terms, which allows for faster seeking into the file. This is actually done here:  This is a single term written to the file. A lot of the stuff Lucene does (prefixes, VInt, etc) are done in the name of conserving space, and it reminds me greatly of LevelDB&#x2019;s SST. In fact, the way terms are stored is pretty much an SST, except that this happens to be on multiple files. Pretty much the entire behavior and all the implications are the same. It also means that searching on this is fast, because the data is sorted, but pretty complex. And it also explains a lot about the actual exposed API that it has. I think that I have a pretty good idea on how things work now. I want to now go back up and look at specific parts of how it works&#x2026; but that is going to be the next post.</p>
