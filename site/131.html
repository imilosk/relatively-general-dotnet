            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have a consultant that did some work for me. While the majority of our people are working in Israel and Poland, we actually have people working for us all over the map.The consultant submitted their invoice at the end of the month and we sent a wire transfer to the provided account. So far, pretty normal and business as usual. We do double verification of account details, to avoid common scams, by the way, so we know that the details we sent were correct. Except&#x2026; the money never arrived. When we inquired, it turned out that the money transfer was reversed. The reason why? This is the address that the consultant provided (not the actual address, mind, but has the same issue). Note that the Mr. Great Consultant1234 Cuba AvenueAlta Vista, Ottawa, K1G 1L7CanadaThe wire transfer was flagged as potential international sanctions violation and refused. That was&#x2026; very strange. It appears that someone saw Cuba in the address, decided that this is a problem and refuse the transfer.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m not sure if I would rather that this is the case of an over active Regex or a human not applying critical thinking.We are now on week two of trying to resolve that with the bank and it is quite annoying.Next port of call, buying Monero on the dark web&#x2026; .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">During benchmark run on a large dataset, I started to notice that longer benchmarks were showing decidedly worse numbers than short ones. In other words, a benchmark that is run for 1 minute is orders of magnitude higher latencies than a benchmark that is run for 30 seconds. And the longer the benchmark, the worst things off. That raised a lot of red flags, and spawn a pretty serious investigation. We take performance very seriously and the observed behavior was that we were getting slower over time. We suspected a leak, high number of GC calls, or memory fragmentation. The scenario under test was a web application using the RavenDB API to talk to RavenDB. We run both the web application and the server under profilers and found a few hot spots, but nothing really major. There was no smoking gun.Then we noticed that the load testing&#xA0; machine was sitting there with 100% CPU. I initially thought that this is us generating too much load for the machine, but that wasn&#x2019;t it. We are using wrk2, which is capable of handling million of requests per seconds. We were generating the requests dynamically using a Lua script, and in one of the scenarios under test, we have code like this:path = &quot;/orders/user/&quot; .. page * pageSize .. &quot;/&quot; .. pageSize .. &quot;/?userId=&quot; .. item.id .. &quot;&amp;deep=y&quot;That isn&#x2019;t the most optimal way to do things, I&#x2019;ll admit. We can do better by using something like table.concat(), but the problem was that regardless of how you build the string, this is supposed to be fairly cheap. The wrk2 project is using LuaJIT, which has a reputation as a really scripting system. I never really thought that this would be a problem. Sure, it is a little wasteful, but it isn&#x2019;t too bad, a few string temporaries and maybe some realloc() calls, but nothing major.Instead, this resulted in us getting far worse results over time. It took a while to actually figure out why, but the root cause is in the way LuaJIT handles string hashing. a = lj_getu32(str);h ^= lj_getu32(str&#x2B;len-4);&#xA;b = lj_getu32(str&#x2B;(len&gt;&gt;1)-2);&#xA;h ^= b; h -= lj_rol(b, 14);&#xA;b &#x2B;= lj_getu32(str&#x2B;(len&gt;&gt;2)-1);&#xA;Strings in Lua are interned, which means that there is just a single copy of a string per value. That means that hashing is important, but the way it does hashing is to take the first 4 bytes, the last 4 bytes and the 4 bytes in the middle and use that for a hash. And that is it.If you have a bunch of strings where those 3 locations match&#x2026; well, welcome to hash collisions. At which point, what is supposed to be a O(1) call becomes an O(N) call. And creating strings will turn the operations into an O(N^2) operation!Here is the reproduction code:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The actual bug is well known (5 or 6 years), but it was only recently fixed and not on the version that wrk2 is using. We had to toss out the entire benchmarking set and start over because of this. We were generating requests with random data, so some of them would hit this problem hard, and some would avoid it by magic. I was not expecting to debug hash collision in Lua code while trying to get some performance numbers from overloading RavenDB, quite random, literally.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Unless I get good feedback / questions on the other posts in the series, this is likely to be the last post on the topic. I was trying to show what kind of system and constraints you have to deal with if you wanted to build a social media platform without breaking the bank.I talked about the expected numbers that we have for the system, and then set out to explain each part of it independently. Along the way, I was pretty careful not to mention any one particular technological solution. We are going to need:CachingObject storage (S3 compatible API)Content Delivery NetworkKey/value storeQueuing and worker infrastructureNote that the whole thing is generic and there are very little constraints on the architecture. That is by design, because if your architecture can hit the lowest common denominator, you have a lot more freedom. Instead of tying yourself to a particular provider, you have a lot more freedom. For that matter, you can likely set things up so you can have multiple disparate providers without too much of a hassle. My goal with this system was to be able to accept 2,500 posts per second and to handle reads of 250,000 per second. This sounds like a lot, but a most of the load is meant to be handled by CDN and the infrastructure, not the core servers. Caching in a social network is somewhat problematic, since you&#x2019;ll have a lot of the work is obviously personalized. That said, there is still quite a lot that can be cached, especially the more popular posts and threads. If we&#x2019;ll assume that only about 10% of the reading load hits our servers, that is 25,000 reads per second. If we have just 25 servers for handling this (assuming five each in five separate data centers) we can accept the load at 1,000 requests per second. On the one hand, that is a lot, but on the other hand&#x2026;. most of the cost is supposed to be about authorization, minor logic, etc. We can also at this point add more application servers and scale linearly. Just to give some indication of costs, a dedicated server with 8 cores &amp; 32 GB disk will cost 100$ a month, and there is no charge for traffic. Assuming that I&#x2019;m running 25 of these, that will cost me 2,500 USD a month. I can safely double or triple that amount without much trouble, I think.Having to deal with 1,000 requests per server is something that requires paying attention to what you are doing, but it isn&#x2019;t really that hard, to be frank. RavenDB can handle more than a million queries a second, for example.One thing that I didn&#x2019;t touch on, however, which is quite important, is the notion of whales. In this case, a whale is a user that has a lot of followers. Let&#x2019;s take Mr. Beat as an example, he has 15 million followers and is a prolific poster. In our current implementation, we&#x2019;ll need to add to the timeline of all his followers every time that he posts something. Mrs. Bold, on the other hand, has 12 million followers. At one time Mr. Beat and Mrs. Bold got into a post fight. This looks like this:Mr. Beat: I think that Mrs. Bold has a Broccoli&#x2019;s bandana. Mrs. Bold: @mrBeat How dare you, you sniveling knaveMr. Beat: @boldMr2 I dare, you green teeth monsterMrs. Bold: @mrBeat You are a yellow belly deerMr. Beat: @boldMr2 Your momma is a dearThis incredibly witty post exchange happened during a three minute span. Let&#x2019;s consider what this will do, given the architecture that we outlined so far:Post #1 &#x2013; written to 15 million timelines.Post #2 - 5 &#x2013; written to the timelines of everyone that follows both of them (mention), let&#x2019;s call that 10 million.That is 55 million timeline writes to process within the span of a few minutes. If other whales also join in (and they might) the number of writes we&#x2019;ll have to process will sky rocket. Instead, we are going to take advantage of the fact that only a small number of accounts are actually followed by many people. We&#x2019;ll place the limit at 10,000 followers. At which point, we&#x2019;ll no longer process writes for such accounts. Instead, we&#x2019;ll place the burden at the client&#x2019;s side. The code for showing the timeline will then become something like this:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The benefit of doing it in this manner is that the high profile users tiimeline reads will have very high cache utilization.Given that the number of high profile people you&#x2019;ll follow are naturally limited, that can save quite a lot of work.The code above can be improved, of course, there are usually a lot of difference in the timeline posts, so we may have a high profile user that is off for a day or two, they shouldn&#x2019;t show up in the current timeline and can be removed entirely. You need to do a bit more work around the time frames as well, which means that timeline should also allow us to query itself by most recent post id, but that is also not too hard to implement. And with that, we are at the end. I think that I covered quite a few edge cases and interesting details, and hopefully that was interesting for you to read. As usual, I really appreciate any and all feedback.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A social media platform has to deal with the concept of now and its history. For the most part, most users are interacting with the current state of the system. Looking at their timeline, watching current posts, etc.&#xA0; At the same time, there is a wealth of information that you can get from looking at the past. It isn&#x2019;t out of the question that you&#x2019;ll have users diving into the history of posts of another user going as far back as possible. That can be a parent whose kids just left the house, looking at baby pictures or it can be a new friend, trying to learn some interesting tidbits before a party (when we still had those). It can also be automated processes, such as: &#x201C;5 years ago you posted&#x2026;&#x201D;The architecture that I presented in these posts is relatively agnostic for such a scenario. Given the timeline feature, going back in time means that you can fairly easily discriminate based on age. Older sections in the timeline can be moved to lower class storage tier (basically, move to HDD instead of NVMe, for example). They are still accessible, still available, but far cheaper to store. I don&#x2019;t believe that you can usually go with an archive tier level for the timelines, not unless you are willing to effectively be unable to access them if a user requests it, but a policy of moving old and rarely used timeline sections and posts to HDD is absolutely doable. Note that things like intelligent tiering is not a good solution for our needs. That would move items based on age and access, but while we want to move items by age, older items are still access, just far more rarely, so we don&#x2019;t want to move them back into hot storage if they are rarely accessed.That said, certain posts are likely to generate active for a long time. So we can&#x2019;t just send data to cold storage just based on age. Need to also take into account the recent access patterns. On the other hand, consider a post a few years ago that talks about Broccoli, when people still did that. Mr. Beat discovers that Mrs. Bold has such a post and blast it all over social media. Very quickly that old post become very active. That means that we should have a way to move data back to hot storage if there is enough access.Ideally, we can rely on the underlying storage to do that for us, but we have to know how it actually works behind the scenes and understand what is actually going on there. The nice thing about this is that unlike most of the details we discussed so far, that is something that we can punt down the road, we already have the architecture in place that will allow us to introduce this cost savings measure down the line, we don&#x2019;t have to have it figured out from day one. Given the fact that we have multi level caches, that means that we can probably just age out old information to cold storage and not usually have to think about it too much.When we have enough data that this is a serious concern, on the other hand&#x2026; we will have the time and resources to also handle it.</p>
