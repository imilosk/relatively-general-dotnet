        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rhino Security is an awesome little framework that provide security infrastructure for applications. I created that after having to rebuild a security infrastructure five times, due to changing requirements. It is implemented on top of NHibernate.  I would like to challenge you to implement Rhino Security in your data access strategy of choice. Here is the design, intro and implementation notes. And of course that the code itself is accessible here. If you think that your data access strategy is awesome, show me the code. Rhino Security is a non trivial example, but it is still quite small, about 1,700 lines of code. So that is quite doable.  Oh, and I would love to see implementations on non RDBMS platforms.  I don&#x27;t expect anyone to step up and do this, by the way. For the simple reason that I don&#x27;t think that this is possible. And yes, that is said in the vain hope that someone will actually show me one.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">You get to have really simple solutions. One of the reasons that I like NHibernate so much is that is allow me to use Object Oriented solutions to my problems. Case in point, we have the Rhino Security library, which provide a facility for asking security questions about your domain. Bart had an issue with Rhino Security, he wanted to extend the library to also contain a type. The original idea was to add a int field called AppSpecific, which will let each app define additional information on top of the existing domain model. That made me feel so Win32 that I had to go and sleep for a while. I suggested the following OO solution: public class BartOperation : Operation&#xA;{&#xA;      OperationType OperationIsStronglyTyped {get;set;}&#xA;&#xA;} &#xA;I mean, if you want to extend Operation, why not... extend operation?&#xA;The problem is, I think, that most people have been so brain washed by the impendence mismatch that this wouldn&#x27;t occur to them. Bart went away and implemented that suggestion, the whole exchange took less than a day.&#xA;Chose your tools carefully, and use them well, for they will reward you aplenty.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Kelly Stuard called me out with regards to the NH Prof user interface:  I&#x27;d just like to weigh in and say that I am completely against the WPF-murder of this application&#x27;s UI.&#xA0; There are several hundred reasons to go away from the OS&#x27;s colors and standard dialogs; I do not see a single one here. In choosing to shove your choices upon your users you are potentially alienating people who may need a particular color contrast or text size(color blind / low vision) or need to only use the keyboard (blind with reader). It looks very sexy, I will admit.&#xA0; However, it is a piece of software I want to *function* very sexy; that is its only job, in my mind.&#xA0; I want it to look just like every other application and respond to my OS changes just like every other application. There are a few reasons that we chose this particular look &amp; feel for the application. One was branding, I wanted the application to remind people of my blog*. The second was that this UI allows us to express a lot of things in a concise fashion while keeping it pretty. The third was that it allows us to create pretty UI. That may seem like an inconsequential point, but it is actually very important. UI sells, period. And good UI sells more than black on gray that is what going with the OS scheme would give us. I am building this application to sell it, and as such, anything that increase the sales count is a huge plus for me.  Now, am I alienating people that would prefer to have a different color scheme? Am I alienating people with screen readers?  Probably so, I am afraid to say. But that is, again, a conscious decision on my part.  There are ways that we can improve the situation for that scenario, such as providing an alternative color scheme or one that pick up the user&#x27;s system colors. WPF also contains the hooks to make applications friendly to screen readers, so that is possible as well. But that isn&#x27;t going to be in version 1.0. I am not sure that it will be in the product at all, for that matter. It is a very simple matter of considering the ROI. Doing something like that is going to take resources that I can invest in other features. In order to justify doing this, I need a big enough user base that require this functionality. At the end of the day, I need to be able to pay the bills. And considering the target audience of the NHibernate Profiler, I don&#x27;t think that this is a Must Have feature for v1.0, and it is a feature that will be triaged along with the others for vNext. * Funny how what seemed like a trivial decision four or five years ago, choosing color scheme for the site, turned out to have such huge implications for the rest of my software.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Fowler has a post about DSL, which contain the following:  The first is in language design. I was talking with a language designer who I have a lot of respect for, and he stressed that a key feature of languages was the ability to define new abstractions. With DSLs I don&#x27;t think this is the case. In most DSLs the DSL chooses the abstraction you work with, if you want different abstractions you use a different DSL (or maybe extend the DSL you&#x27;re using). Sometimes there&#x27;s a role for new abstractions, but those cases are the minority and when they do happen the abstractions are limited. Indeed I think the lack of ability to define new abstractions is one of the things that distinguishes DSLs from general purpose languages. I disagree with the statement that this is an exception. This is something that come up again and again in a DSL. You start with a given concept of what you want to do, and you give it to the users. Rinse &amp; repeat a couple of time and you have a language that the users can start play with. The main problem is that not giving the users that facilities for abstraction usually mean that they will work around your system, or that the DSL scripts that you will have will suffer from copy &amp; paste, unnecessary complexity, etc. A trivial example would be how to define customer roles. You want to be able to process orders based on customer role, and as such, it is important to be able to define how you choose a customer. Not only that, but even the customer selection criteria should be abstracted. Here are a few examples:  Bad customer:  Bad credit rating OR More than 5 returns last year OR More than 5 helpdesk calls last 6 months Silver Customer  More than 5 purchases Gold Customer  Total purchases over 5,000$ Preferred customer:  Not a bad customer Gold customer We want to define roles using other roles. Because that is how the business thinks about it. We naturally create abstractions for ourselves, because this is how we think. If we need to go back to the development team for each new abstraction, we have a heavy weight process that the users will work around. Most of my DSL contains some form of user define abstractions, usually in the form of: define bad_customer:&#xA;&#x9;customer.HasBadCredit or &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;customer.TotalReturnsIn(1.year) &gt; 5 or&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;customer.TotalHelpdeskCallsin(6.months) &gt; 5&#xA;&#xA;define silver_customer:&#xA;&#x9;customer.TotalPurchases &gt; 5&#xA;&#xA;define gold_customer:&#xA;&#x9;customer.TotalPurchasesAmount &gt; 5000&#xA;&#xA;define preferred_customer:&#xA;&#x9;gold_customer and not bad_customer&#xA;&#xA;This is usually user editable, and we plug this into the intellisense of the system. In one project, I even provided a refactoring support, Extract Business Term (bound to CTRL&#x2B;ALT&#x2B;V, go R#!)&#xA;Abstractions are important, and building them into the language is just as important. You want to empower the users to extend your language, even if it a language that is very limited in scope. Because you give them the option to take the language to realms that you never dreamed on.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My post about tests got the expected response, and I think that Denis&#x27;s comment is a good sample of the type of feedback that I got:  ...you won&#x27;t be able to ship periodically at sustainable costs and quality without relevant engineering practices like unit tests, refactoring and continuous integration... Despite several attempts in repeating that, it seems like many people missed the part that I explicitly stated: I wasn&#x27;t trying to say that tests are not valuable. I was trying to talk about the blind faith that people put in tests. Now, to Denis&#x27;s comment. Yes, I would be able to ship periodically without tests.  I am not talking in the air, I have the practical experience and two years of a running project to back me up on that. We had a CI process in place, which deploy the application to a staging server, and that was it. Refactoring... is not a subject that I can talk about in the context of this application without first explaining the architecture. I came to that project shortly after finishing up a project that was... problematic. And I was determined to avoid the same mistakes. One of the first thing that we did was to define the core parts of the system, and build just enough of that to serve us. So far, this is normal, except that we added a tiny twist.  We applied the Open Close Principle as a holistic view for the entire project. If we needed to change a line of existing code, that was a bug, and we had to refactor that area of the system to make sure that the next time we need to change this, we wouldn&#x27;t have to change existing code. Adding a new feature consisted entirely of adding new code. We didn&#x27;t touch existing code. Well, not very often, to be honest. This is the same project where I spent three months straight without even once going to the infrastructure directory, indeed, after three months we run into a problem, and it took me 10 minutes to remember that we are using a container in the app, and that the new class didn&#x27;t match our convention, so Binsor did not register it. A lot of my ideas about zero friction development came directly from this project. Because we always wrote new code, and each feature was isolated from all other features, we were able to keep a rapid pace of development for the lifetime of the project. I mentioned that we didn&#x27;t have automated tests, we didn&#x27;t feel the lack. Off the top of my head, I can&#x27;t recall any regression bugs that we had, except with infrastructure going bad (IT admins removing our shared storage, BizTalk changes we weren&#x27;t told about, stuff like that). I am pretty sure that there were some, but I can&#x27;t think of any, so that put them at a very low number. And some stats about the project. It is running for 2 years (I left after the first year, and the team continued to provide new features and releases after I left), currently at over 200,000 lines of code, is considered a major success from the business point of view and its scope has tripled since the original inception. And just to reiterate, I like tests. I think that they are important and that they have proven themselves in the field. BUT, They aren&#x27;t a silver bullet, having them wouldn&#x27;t make the project succeed. And not having tests wouldn&#x27;t make the project fail.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been quite on that front for a while, but not because we stopped working on that, but because we were quietly adding features and polishing what we have to reach a whole new level. Some of those features are not yet complete, but we have one feature that is good enough to show.  Analysis In this case, a picture is worth significantly more than a thousand words.  Here is one of the analysis modes that we support, showing you all the unique queries that you application perform.   But wait, there is more.
