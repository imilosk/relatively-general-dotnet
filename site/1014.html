            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">ThreadSafeQueue is a nice way to handle multi threading, but I needed something more.    I want to use this to speed up UI responsiveness, so this means that I need some way to test whatever an object exist in the queue without waiting (that would defeat the whole point, wouldn&#x27;t it?).    I wanted to be able to do something like:            object o;                        do                        {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; o = q.TryDequeue();                                    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; UpdateWaitUI();                                }while(o == null);                DisplayObject((StronglyTypedObject)o);    Here are my additions to the class:    Test:            #region TryDequeueWithWorkerThreadsReturnSameNumberOnItems                                &#xA0;                        [Test]                        public void TryDequeueWithWorkerThreadsReturnSameNumberOnItems()                        {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; int objectCount=0, createdObjects= 100;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; ThreadStart ts = new ThreadStart(TryDeuqueWorkerThread);                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Thread first = new Thread(ts),second = new Thread(ts);                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; first.Start();                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; second.Start();                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; createdObjects; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; q.Enqueue(new object());                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; }                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; runThread = false;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; first.Join();                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; second.Join();                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; while(q.TryDequeue()!=null)                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; objectCount&#x2B;&#x2B;;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Assert.AreEqual(createdObjects,objectCount,&quot;Got a different amount of objects than those created&quot;);                                                        }                                &#xA0;                        private void TryDeuqueWorkerThread()                        {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; object o;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; while(runThread)                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; o = q.TryDequeue();                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; if(o!=null)                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; itemsQueue.Enqueue(o);                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; }                        }                                &#xA0;                #endregion    Code:            /// &lt;summary&gt;                        /// Resets the event if needed.                        /// Only called when we have lock!

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, apperantly my last post about agile UI wasn&#x27;t breaking any new ground, here are some pointers regarding it:     Model View Presenter&#xA0;-&#xA0;    Matt Berther, Here is a good description, from the comments of the post             The difference between MVP and class MVC is that in MVC the Controller changes the Model or the View and the View gets data from the Model. The model also updates the view when data changes.                 Using MVP, the View only communicates with the Presenter. The presenter then communicates with both the View and the Model.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently noticed that my tests are taking quite a bit of time to run, this is partly because I&#x27;m on my laptop, with a slow HD, and partly (I guess, didn&#x27;t check it yet) because that in many tests I&#x27;m doing heavy stuff that I would only need to do once in the application, but I&#x27;m doing it for each test to keep them isolated. (Building AppDomains, and the like).    Currently I&#x27;ve only ~150 tests, and they take more than two minutes to run. I&#x27;m going to invest some time in it, I want to cut it to under a minute. I just checked the timing report, and I&#x27;ve got test cases there that are way out of bound.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, I&#x27;ve finished all the published books of&#xA0;The Sword of Truth, and I have to say that it was quite&#xA0;a good read. There are apperantely to be twelve books in this saga, and the last three books are a trilogy. It make for a rather weak ending of the ninth book, but I think that this is to be expected, since the &quot;trilogy&quot; is more likely to be one book too long to tell in a single cover.         &#xA0;&#xA0;    This book is about pacifism at its worst, and how to overcome it. I liked the end result, but I somehow begin to think that the books are loosing their edges, there aren&#x27;t as many thrilling moments, but those that are there are just as good as those in the previous books. For the first time, I felt the plot being weaved, which is not a good thing (this means that I notice other things than the story). I think that it&#x27;s a measure of the weak plot twists that appear in this books - an important letter is burned in an attack just before the crucial information is revealed, for instance. Or magical statues which just appear of nowhere, or the whole &quot;something aweful is happening, but we aren&#x27;t going to tell you because it might affect your decision&quot; attidute in the beginning of the book. Another thing that I didn&#x27;t like is the whole resolution of the poisioning of the main hero, he should have died, but magic suddenly saved him. This is just not credible, I expected much more from the book. The overall impression is good, but those thing really put a damper on my enthusiasm for the book.         This book begins with the main heroine vanishing, not only from the story, but from everyone&#x27;s memory. Except for the main hero, who everyone else thinks crazy. This book is far more credible and solid than the previous one, and I couldn&#x27;t find any real holes in the plot. It also has some amazing fighting scenes, where you can really feel the tension and the violence. The only problem, as I already said, is that this is a first part in a trilogy and that it cut rather suddenly in the middle of the story. This part solves the part about the credibility of the hero, and lies the foundations for solving this problem, but it&#x27;s ending is rather abrupt and leave much to be desired.     &#xA0;            Final impression:                 Overall, I found the books to be of high quality and entertaining (which is the most important quality), the 7th &amp; 8th books (The Pillars Of Creations&#xA0;and Naked Empire) weren&#x27;t as good as the rest of the books, but they are still very good compare to many others. The last book, however, more than compensate in the quality department. The only complaint I&#x27;ve about it is that it ends too soon. I think that since I read all of the first nine books one after the other, without having to wait, then it&#x27;s a cause for frustration when I now need to wait to read the completion of this saga.                 All in all, I most enjoyed Wizard&#x27;s First Rule (1th) and Faith of the Fallen (6th). The first because it&#x27;s such a good book, and breaks many expectations that I&#x27;d about the way the story would go. The second because of the brilliant description of marxist &amp; relegious society and the way the hero handle being thrown into such place without his customary advantage (sorry, but I do try to have no spoilers).                 All in all, I would really like to read the finish of those books (I expect that it would get to this point sometimes in 2009, but no matter, I can wait :-) ) and I highly recommend reading them, but beware of the length of the books and the fact that they&#xA0;are quite hard to put down.                 Still waiting for The Wheel of Time, however. Less than five months to the release of Knife Of Dreams. A friend of mine thinks that The Sword of Truth&#xA0;is better than The Wheel of Time, I disagree mainly because of the depth of the The Wheel of Time&#xA0;which is (in my opinion, at least) far more complex than The Sword of Truth, and contain more realistic world. The Sword of Truth, however, is far more entertaining.

At first, everything seems fine, but then Svn refuse to play any longer and seems to be sulking in silence. (No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.)    This occured both on my own server, and on Berlios&#x27;s server, so I don&#x27;t really knows what to think. I&#x27;m using the svn protocol (not the svn&#x2B;ssh), and it always seems to be happening after a couple of hours of running the CC.Net service.    Anyone has any ideas how do solve this? Currently I moved the repository to my server, and the CC.Net is using the file:// protocol to work with it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x27;m now deep inside The Sword of Truth saga, it was highly recommend by a friend of mine, and I must say it&#x27;s one of the more involved and complex books I&#x27;ve read.&#xA0;The cast of characters is small (which is a relief when compared to the Wheel of Time, which has hundreds of characters), likable and real.     I don&#x27;t know if I can easily explain it, but all the books contain very tightly woven plots, and capture the reader. Beware, I read the first seven books in the last week, and they are ~3,500 pages. The action is fast paced, thrilling, and highly enjoying.    I&#x27;ve heard it say that the novels are very violent, but I found it to be a reasonable level. It&#x27;s not a children story, and it&#x27;s not supposed to be one. It&#x27;s very good to read fantasy that is meant for adult, with adults as heroes, unlike most of the fantasy meant for teenagers, where the heroes are both young an immature. The books are far more complex than the normal fantasy books, and I liked that a lot.    Here are the current books, and their respective reviews. I&#x27;ll try to write my impression of the book, and not their plot, but there might be some spoilers.            When I think of these books, I have hard time to justify what exactly I like in them so much. Partly it is that from the first page to the last, the books are filled with action and drama. The story has epic proportions and is told in a way that is both convincing and heartfelt.                It&#x27;s not about perfect heroes, or valiant deeds. It&#x27;s about imperfect persons, fear and doubt; it&#x27;s about triumph of good versus evil, but it a way that you can believe. The books do not require you to suspend all faith in reason, rather they have an inner logic that is consistant and reasonable.                 Each book complement the others very well, and they can (as I had) be read as one long story, which is merely broken into books for ease of carrying. The plot sustains its high quality throughout the books, which is rarely so in other books. Each book pick up the plot just where the last one left it, and push it onward.                I started to suspect so only in the last few books, but the books seems to be mocking certain believes. Racism and other -isms (Blood of the Fold, and others, in regard to magic) and Man-Is-Evil and Communism (Faith fo the Fallen). It&#x27;s usually very light, but also very good.                Beyond that, there are the characters. The good characters are believable, they have doubts, they have fears, they get tired of the fight. They are very easy to identify with, and even easier to love. They are not entirely good (some of the best characters are torturer by profession, for example). The evil ones are just as good, meaning that they are not one dimentional &quot;I&#x27;m evil because it&#x27;s fun&quot;, but they have reasons for what they do, and they even manage to make sense, if you are willing to accept some base presumptions on their parts. Most of the evil characters are not evil to the core, but rather believe in what they are doing, and are willing to do what it takes to do it. (Some of the good characters are the same, and they are different only in their believes, and not their means.)                There are several Evil (with a capital E) characters, and they are deranged beasts, yet their portrayal is just as true. And the sense they evoke in the reader is just as strong, you are supposed to hate them. Or pity them, and you&#x27;ve no choice but to do so.             This is the first book, and it start out as many fantasy novels. A young man find a damsel in distress, with dark secrets burdening her, and discover that he is destined for a magic sword and to save the world from the dominion of a ruthless, evil tyrant, or risk the destruction of all.    That&#xA0;is how the book starts, like many other fantasy novels, but it quickly turns much more serious. Our hero is captured, tortured and broken. By this time, you&#x27;re already bonded with the hero, and Goodkind makes sure that you suffer as well as the hero. The inevitable escape turns out to be unlikely as well, since the evil overlord hands over the keys and ask the hero if he would like a horse for the escape.    This book is far more real than many others that I&#x27;ve read. It capture the heart and soul of the reader, and put them in place of the hero and heroine.         The second book start with drastic consequences of vanquishing the evil at the end of the first book. Our heroes are yanked from their soon-to-be-wedded bliss and are torn apart, each thinking the worst of the other. It&#x27;s hard to describe much of the going-on in the book without spoiling the plot, but we learn much more about the world and the abilities of the hero and heroine. For the first time, their love is put to the test, and much more background is unfolded. The most impressive thing that I found in this book was that despite the amount of story and details the story covers, the reader is not drowning in all the details.        In the third book, invasion threaten the land, from a force of righteous evil which seeks to destroy all magic in the world and free mankind from its interference. This is the first fantasy novel which actually describe the actions of a victorious army in conquered lands (hint, it&#x27;s not pretty). Some very fine scenes of battle, and even better scene of turbulent emotions and actions. &#xA0;    &#xA0;    &#xA0;Plague is released into the domain of our heroes, and in order to stop it, desperate actions need to be taken. The following sentence pretty much sumerise the book. But it doesn&#x27;t do it justice. The book is filled with action and emotions, with bloody battle and heroic scenes. Despicable evil and vile deeds. The end is climatic, touching, and as abrupt as anything.        Even more trouble follows, the heroes finally get to marry and lie with each other, with troubling results. The actions continue in a fast pace, and the ending is heart tearing. It&#x27;s a good book, but I had many a hard moment reading it. The emphaty Goodkind manage to evoke for some of the bad characters is painful. One of the characters is falling to evil (threatening and then killing a woman, for example) and I just couldn&#x27;t stand that he would do such a thing. He had such a potential for good that it hurt.        This is by far the best book, in my opinion. It talks about a country where man is thought evil by birth, and the only hope is absolution in the next life (sound familiar?). The hero is forced to take a trip to this land, and to live in despair in it. This land believe that it&#x27;s the duty of all man kind to help those in needs, and they enforce this policy with iron fist. It&#x27;s much live Soviet Russia would&#x27;ve liked to be (in ideals, if not in practice), and it suffer from much the same flaws. It&#x27;s a very good protrayal of a society where basic rules of economy are ignored. Those with means are Evil because they have means, the poor are novel because of their suffering and no evil action can be blamed of the aggressor, but is rather blamed on the circumstances that caused him to do so. It&#x27;s a beautiful work, and the end is very good. Hopeful, even.    &#xA0;    At first, I thought that I picked the wrong book by mistake, as it had nothing to do with the story so far. It didn&#x27;t degrade the quality of the story at all, but I sorely wanted to read about the familiar characters again. It&#x27;s a good book, but I couldn&#x27;t very well like it. I want my old characters back, not to read about new ones, and watch them develop all over again. Beyond that, the ending was the weakest point of the book. After spending ~650 pages about new characters, we are given a few chapters about the old characters, and then the book conclude, not in a thunder, as the other books, but in a rash, as if the author was in a hurry and couldn&#x27;t be held to his usual high standards. It&#x27;s a shame, because it ruins a book that could be very good otherwise.     &#xA0;&#xA0;    I&#x27;ve not read these two yet, I&#x27;m currently started Naked Empire, so I&#x27;ll post when I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;m hoping that they prove to be better than the 7th book.[Listening to: The Patterns of Amber - Mercedes Lackey - Freedom, Flight &amp; Fantasy(02:25)]</p>
