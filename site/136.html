            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Just had to trouble shoot a really strange problem in a production system. The situation is pretty simple. At one point in time, a machine had an issue and shortly afterward became utterly unable to reach the outside world. I was luckily able to SSH into the machine, but any outgoing connection would fail.Given that TCP worked (I was using it or SSH), how can that be? I can create a connection to the system and have bidirectional communication, but not initiate any calls to the outside world.Strange doesn&#x2019;t begin to cover how weird this is. The reason for the failure, by the way, was that the disk was absolutely full. The reason for the network outage was a mystery.It took a while to figure out that the error was that the disk was full, which caused an error is systemd-resolved, which failed to setup DNS properly. I was also unable to make connections via IP address, which was strange, but the problem went away after the disk was cleared.I have to say, network failure due to disk errors was not how I expected to start the day.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We are hiring again (this time for Junior C# Dev positions in Israel). That means that I go through CVs (quite a few, actually).&#xA0; I like going over the resumes directly, to get a feel for not just a particular candidate but what is, for lack of a better term, the state of the market. This time, I noticed a much higher percentage of resumes with a GitHub repository link. Anytime that I see such a link, I go and look at what they have there. That is often really interesting. Then again, you run into things like this:On the one hand, this is non production code, it is obviously a teaching project, which is awesome. On the other hand, I find such code painful to look at. In the past, I would rate highly anyone that would show a GitHub account in the CV, since I could expect to see some of their projects there, usually unique ones. This time? I&#x2019;m seeing a lot of basically homework assignments, and those aren&#x2019;t really that interesting to review or look at. Especially since a lot of the candidates apparently had the same courses, so I saw the same 5 projects repeated over and over again.In other words, just a GitHub account with some repositories are no longer that interesting or meaningful.Another thing that I noticed was that a lot of those candidates had profiles with profile pictures like:A small tip, if you expect people to visit your profile (and I assume you do, since you provided the link in the resume), it is worth it to put a (professional) picture of yourself there. The profiler readme on GitHub is also surprising attractive when looking at a candidate.Another tip, if you see a position for a C# Junior Developer, it is acceptable to apply if you don&#x2019;t have all the requirements, or if you exceed them. But if you are trying to find a new job as a lawyer specializing in family law, maybe don&#x2019;t try to apply to a tech company. And yes, I&#x2019;m using this post as a want to vent while going over so many CVs. Most CVs are dry, but one candidate just got bumped to the next stage based solely on the fact that in they had a &#x201C;Making awesome pancakes&#x201D; in the CV, which made me laugh.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We got an interesting modeling question from a customer: &#x201C;What is the optimal manner to represent time sensitive information in RavenDB?&#x201D; The initial thought was that they would use revisions and they asked about querying those. The issue is that this isn&#x2019;t really the purpose for revisions, they are great if you want to see what the state of the system at a particular point in time, but not so good if your business logic has meaning over time.The best scenario for temporal data that I&#x2019;m aware of is payroll. You have a lot of data that make sense only in the context of the time if was relevant for. For example, consider an employee that is hired at a given salary level, then given raises over time. The data in this case is divided into several layers.I&#x2019;m going to use paper documents as the model here, because it makes it much easier to consider the modeling implications than when talking about JSON or class structures. On the most basic model, we have the Payslip document, which represent the amount (work, deductions, taxes, etc) that was paid to an employee at a particular point in time. This is similar to this:Once created, such a document will not change. It represent an action that happened in the past and is immutable. From this you can figure out taxes, overall payments, etc.The Payslip is computed from the Timesheet document, which is similar to this one:A Timehseet document is updated during the Payroll Period whenever an employee signs in or out. At the end of the Payroll Period, a manager will sign off on the Timesheet and approve it for payment. At this point, all the relevant business rules are run and the final Payslip is generated for each employee. Once the Timesheet is signed off and paid, it is no longer mutable and will not change. This make sense, since it represent something that already happened. In some cases, you&#x2019;ll have new information, such as an employee that worked, but didn&#x2019;t report their hours. They will need to do so in a new Timesheet and a new Payslip will be generated.Using the real world analogy, the Timesheet document is stored at the head office, and you cannot go and update that once it was submitted.So far, we haven&#x2019;t seen anything related to things that change over time. In fact, the fact that we have separate documents for Payslips and Timesheets means that we can ignore a lot of the complexity that you&#x2019;ll usually have to deal with in temporal databases.We can&#x2019;t completely get away from it, however. We need to consider the employee&#x2019;s Contract, however. Usually when we think about the employment contract we think about something like this:The contract specify details such as the hourly rate, overtime payment, vacation time, etc. In payroll systems, contracts are actually more complex than that, because you have to take into account that they change.For example, consider the following scenario:1996 &#x2013; Hired as mailroom clerk &#x2013; 4.75$ / hour1998 &#x2013; Promoted to junior clerk &#x2013; 5.25$ / hour1999 &#x2013; Promoted to clerk &#x2013; 5.40$ / hour2002 &#x2013; Promoted to senior clerk &#x2013; 6.20$ / hourHow do you handle something like that, in terms of modeling?The answer depends quite heavily on how your business logic handles this. One way to handle this is to create revisions. Using the real world logic, we are talking about signing a new contract and expiring the old one. But in reality, that isn&#x2019;t how things are done. You&#x2019;ll usually just update the payment terms.How does this looks like in terms of the data modeling when using RavenDB,however? Well, there are two options. We can represent the data as simple values, like so:When the data changes, we update those values (which generates revisions for the old data). However, that isn&#x2019;t usually ideal, because business logic usually want to access the past values. For example, your contract may change mid payroll period, so your hourly rate is different depending if the hours worked on Monday or Thursday. In this case, you&#x2019;ll want to represent the values changing in the model directly, like so:In most cases, this is the best option for modeling data where the temporal aspects of the data needs to be directly exposed to the business logic.</p>
