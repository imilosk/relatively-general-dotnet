            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The actual problem has been fixed and it will be part of NH 2.1 Alpha 2. That is why we call them alphas, after all :-)  The actual bug is pretty convulsed mess, to be frank. And it is no wonder that it slipped by me. Yes, I am the one responsible for that, so I guess I am making excuses. Let me tell you about the actual scenario. When you are using NHibernate 2.1 Alpha 1 (it does not affect NHibernate 2.0 or 2.0.1) with a System.Transaction.Transaction, there is a slightly different code path that we have to go through, because the actual work that has to be done is no longer controlled by NHibernate, but by the DTC infrastructure.  So far, so good. The problem is that most of the time, this is done on the same thread as the application that we are running on. There are cases, specifically, when using a DTC with multiple durable enlistments, that the actual work is done on a worker thread. The problem is that if there is an error during that phase, for example, if we are trying to execute invalid command, or run into transaction deadlock, NHibernate wouldn&#x2019;t properly handle this error, and it would bubble up. The result of unhandled thread exception is, of course, an application crash.  That is considered to be a bad thing, I understand, so after being able to isolate the problem, I went ahead and fix this. You can get the trunk now and get the fix, or wait until Alpha 2 is released.  Who is impacted by this?   You have to use multiple different durable enlistments inside a distributed transaction for the error condition to even be applicable. The problem is that there is one very common scenario that will run into this every single time. The .NET Service Buses all wrap their processing in a TransactionScope, and then tend to have multiple durable enlistments (the DB and MSMQ). This means that if you are using NServiceBus, Rhino ServiceBus or MassTransit alongside with NHibernate 2.1 Alpha1, you are probably impacted by this issue.  As I mentioned, a fix has already been committed (r4149) and it will be part of NHibernate 2.1 Alpah2.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you have heard me speak, you are probably are aware that I tend to use this analogy a lot. Any 3rd party system that I have to integrate with was written by a drunken monkey typing with his feet.  So far, I am sad to say, that assumption has been quite accurate over a large range of projects.  You are probably already familiar with concepts of System Boundary and Anti Corruption Layer and how to apply them in order to keep the crazy monkey shtick away from your system, so I am not going to talk about those.  What I do want to talk about now is something slightly different, it is not related to the actual 3rd party system itself, it is related to its management.  One of the more annoying things about 3rd party stuff is that it is usually broken in&#x2026; interesting ways. So you really want to be able to test that thing during the integration phase, so you would know what to expect. That seems like a very simple concept, right? All you have to do is to hit the QA env. and have a ball. That bring us back to the system management, and the really big screw ups that are happening there.  Before we continue, I want to state that usually, when I am integrating with a 3rd party, I usually do so out of some business reason, so it tend to be the case that I want to give them money, customers, pay per operation, or something else that is to the benefit of that 3rd party! Making integration with your software hard has a direct affect on the number of people who are trying to give you money!&#xA0;     That is why I am so surprised by the amount of trouble that you have to go through in some organizations (I would say, the majority of the organization). Here is a partial list of things that I run into recently:     Having no QA env. &#x2013; We were told to basically just work off of the spec and push it to production. You can imagine how big a success that was.    Having a QA env. that was a different version than the one in production, don&#x2019;t tell the people that are integrating with you anything about that.    A variation of the above, have QA env. that is significantly different than production.    Having a QA env. that has real world effects. For example, if I am testing my bulk mail integration, I do not expect all those emails to be actually sent! Or, in another memorable case, if I am integrating with a merchant provider and testing authorization, I do not want to see those in my real credit report!    Having a QA env. that requires frequent human intervention. For example:         In order to validate that your integration has been successful, you have to call someone and wait until they verify that yes, the appropriate values are there in the appropriate system. Each and every time.      The integration is a one way operation (imagine something like CreateUser, which would fail if it already exists), and you cannot use any dummy values (imagine that you need to pass a valid credit card to that function), you have to have real ones. So every time you test the integration, you have to call someone and have them reset that information.       Having a QA env. that is down for two weeks just as we were suppose to test the integration.    That is why I am saying that the system management is such a crucial thing. And why I am so surprised and disappointed to see so many organizations get it wrong in ways that are so not funny.  If you are building a system that people will integrate with, consider, as soon as possible, the implications of not having a good testing environment for your system. As a matter of fact, I suggest building QA hooks from day one, so you can pass a flag to the system that would tell it &#x201C;this is only for tests&#x201D;, which would mean that any external action on the system would be omitted, but all the logic and behavior are retained.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Before I start, I wanted to explain that NHibernate fully support the identity generator, and you can work with it easily and without pain.  There are, however, implications of using the identity generator in your system. Tuna does a great job in detailing them. The most common issue that you&#x2019;ll run into is that identity breaks the notion of unit of work. When we use an identity, we have to insert the value to the database as soon as we get it, instead of deferring to a later time. It also render batching useless.  And, just to put some additional icing on the cake. On SQL 2005 and SQL 2008, identity is broken.  I know that &#x201C;select ain&#x2019;t broken&#x201D; most of the time, but this time, it appears it does :-)  We strongly recommend using some other generator strategy, such as guid.comb (similar to new sequential id) or HiLo (which also generates human readable values).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So far I posted quite a few of posts about building the document database. To be frank, the reason that I did this is because the idea has been bouncing in my head a lot recently, and sitting down and actually thinking about it has been great, especially since now I have the design dancing in my head, shiny &amp; beautiful. Here is the full list, in case you missed anything:      Schema-less databases     Designing a document database     Designing a document database: Storage     Designing a document database: Scale     Designing a document database: Authorization     Designing a document database: Concurrency     Designing a document database: Attachments     Designing a document database: Replication     Designing a document database: Views     Designing a document database: Aggregation     Challenge: C# Rewriting     Designing a document database: Aggregation Recalculating     Designing a document database: View syntax     Designing a document database: Remote API &amp; Public API    A few days ago I asked on twitter what do people think, do I have this written up yet or not. Opinions seems to be divided on this score. Let me try to set the record straight. I have a lot of scattered code around this, yes. But it is not a project, is is a lot of tiny experiments to prove that one approach or the other would work. This series of posts has required a lot of research. But I don&#x2019;t have anything that is even remotely close to a working system.  I am estimating that it would take a month or two to take this from the drawing board to something that I would be willing to use in production*. This if full time work, by the way. It is likely that I can get something usable faster than that, depending on your definition of usable :-). Most of the challenge is going to be in implementing the views, as I see it now. Everything else seems to be pretty straightforward.  That is somewhat of a problem. I don&#x2019;t really want to spend several months (and the associated support costs afterward) to build an open source project. The main issue is that while it is fun, there is simply no money in it, and I heard that eating is mandatory. On the other hand, I don&#x2019;t really see something like that selling as a commercial package. This is infrastructure, and infrastructure has been commoditized. The ideal solution from my point of view is what we tried to do with Linq to NHibernate. Getting a company, or several companies, to sponsor its development as an OSS project.  The motivation would be the same as usual, this is something that the aforementioned companies need, and are willing to pay for. It didn&#x2019;t end up the way I expected it with Linq for NHibernate, but it ended up very well after all, so I am happy about that.   Oh, and as an aside, if you want more posts in this series, do suggest a few topics that you want to hear about.   * Just to give you an idea about the complexity involved, I estimated Linq to NHibernate to be about 3 months.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the greatest challenges that we face when we try to design API is balancing power, flexibility, complexity, extensibility and version tolerance. There is a set of tradeoffs that we have to make in order to make sure that we design an API, and selecting the right tradeoffs impacts the way&#xA0; that users will work with the software.  One of the decisions that I made about the docs db is that it would be actually have two published API. The first would be the remote API, accessible for clients, and the second would be a public API, accessible for people who want to extend the db. I consider extending the db to be a very common operation, for doing things like adding more functions for the views, supplying the sharding function, etc. I am assuming that most people who would want to do this extension would be .Net devs, so I am just going to use my usual style here and expose some extension points so it will be possible to mix &amp; match things.  For the remote API, we need a way to add / remove documents, get a document and query a view. I would like that part of the API to be accessible from any language, even if I don&#x2019;t foresee it getting used much in other languages. The idea of being able to access it from JavaScript, and making the entire application hosted through the DB is actually a very interesting idea, see CouchApp for more details. Making it accessible for everyone is a pretty good idea, and I think that adopting&#x2019;s a REST API similar to the one that CouchDB is using would be a good choice. Something that I would be extremely interested on, as a matter of fact, would be to make use of Astoria&#x2019;s REST API, instead of having to write my own implementation. I think it bears some investigating, since on the minus side there is the problem that Astoria expects some sort of schema from the backend implementation, but it would be an interesting avenue for investigating.  Currently I am thinking about an API similar to:     POST or PUT to /docs[/id] &#x2013; to create/update a document    POST to /bulk_docs &#x2013; to create/update a batch of documents    POST or PUT to /views &#x2013; to create / update a view definition    GET from /docs/id to get a document    GET from /views/name &#x2013; to get all view docs of particular view    GET from /views/name?key=foo &#x2013; to get all view docs with matching key    GET from /views/name?start=foo&amp;end=bar &#x2013; to get all view docs within range   This seems to be a pretty simple proposition, and it seems pretty complete.  Thoughts?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was asked how we can handle more complex views scenarios. So let us take a look at how we can deal with them.  Joins  In a many to one scenario, (post &amp; comments), how can we get both on them in one call to the database? I am afraid that I am not doing anything new here, since the technique is actually described here. The answer to that is quite simple, you don&#x2019;t. What you can do, however, is generate a view that will allow you to get both of them at the same time. For example:     The key here is that views are always calculated in sort order, so what is actually happening here is that we sort by post id, then by IsPost. Since false is higher then true, the actual post is always the first item, with the comments directly following that. This means that we can query for all of them in one DB call.   Returning more than a single result per row  To be fair, I haven&#x2019;t considered this, but it seems like a pretty obvious that this is needed. Here is the original request:     Question: can a view contain more rows than the underlying document database? For example: assume an invoice database (each document is an invoice with buyer&#x27;s and seller&#x27;s Tax ID). I want to create index: Tax ID -&gt; #of invoices, where tax id can belong either to buyer or seller. In worst case scenario, unique tax IDs in every invoice, we&#x27;ll have index with 2N entries. How view syntax would look like?   If I understand the problem correctly, this can be resolve using the following view definition:     Thoughts?</p>
