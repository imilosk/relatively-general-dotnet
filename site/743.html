            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Before watching the show:  It is great that we are finally seeing signs of changes  Technologically, doesn&#x27;t sound much different than MonoRail  Politically, great news  Not sure why everyone is raving about the routing support During:  Things I haven&#x27;t heard in Microsoft talk so far:   Unit Testing  Mocking  Not using the designer  &#xA0;Separation of Concerns  Maintainable by default My stuff that are being mentioned:   Brail  Rhino Mocks Leaving holes for the community to plug.  Great things that shouldn&#x27;t have caused excitement:   Clean URL  Clean HTML  Not using post backs It shows some nice possibilities of C# 3.0, I think that this is showing some new API styles that we can use in C# 3.0  Things that are complete surprise:   Getting a test project that support NUnit, MbUnit, etc Key phrases:   Not forced  Mockable  Testable  We should look into it IHttpRequest, sweet!  There was a lot of time spent on routing  A moment of bliss:   &quot;If you know MonoRail, it is the logical equivalent to layout&quot; - I had to say the reverse too often Server controls for this framework are just renderers. This means that I can plug them into MonoRail. After:  I need to do more C# 3.0 stuff, I actually installed Beta 2 while I watched the movie.  Routing is nice, and I like the idea of having is centralized, but I still can&#x27;t figure out why is was such a big thing. &#xA0; Summary: The MVC framework is fairly standard, there was another one a short while ago, ProMesh.NET, which much of the same capabilities. That was not the important part of the presentation as far as I am concerned. The important part was (a) awareness and (b) willingness to cooperate with the community. And that was the best news I had from Microsoft in a long while.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rob Conery&#xA0;has an excellent post about Imploding Rails, which manage to hit a lot of my own thoughts about Rails. I believe that I have stated it before, I am thrilled by what is going on there, but I don&#x27;t see a good reason to move, since all the nice stuff are either already here or can be brought here. And yes, that include the Ruby&#x27;s magic.  James Avery has a broader look at this, which I agree to, but doesn&#x27;t negate&#x27;s Rob&#x27;s points. Rob&#x27;s comment on James&#x27; post had me LOLing:  Ruby is slow, I need to write an extension for it in C.Great, now you have two problems.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, since I have started thinking about using:  import file from anotherFile.boo It occurred to me that there are plenty of reasons to want to do similar things. And boo is flexible enough to make some interesting things with it. What about bringing in WSDL definition at compile time?  import webservice from &quot;http://localhost/who/is.there&quot; as WhoIsThereService And then writing a small compiler step that does all the rest. Usually the first twenty or so lines of my my Windsor.boo file are just import statements, they really make it harder to read, why not split them to another file?  import all from imports.boo I can probably think of a few other interesting things to do with it, as well.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">While a DSL can really cut down the amount of code that you need to write, putting everything in one file is not a good idea. But I like my DSLs to be script&#xA0; like, without the need for an explicit compilation step. I have thought about it for a while now, and yesterday ago Craig Neuwirt* asked how it can be done using Binsor.  My default language is Boo, obviously, which is a static, compiled language that pretends that it is dynamic and scriptish, giving the best of all worlds. One of the cool things about Boo is that you can reference an assembly by just doing this:  import System.Data.SqlClient from System.Data  This make it very easy to write scripts, because you just declare things and they will be automatically referenced, without needing to pass parameters to the script runner. Now, I wanted to have some way to handle file inclusion as well. But Boo doesn&#x27;t support this. This is not something that you can do in a method, or dynamic loading, you have to do this as part of the compilation process. In a normal language, I would be left with building pre-processors, or doing heuristics to find all the relevant files that I want, or write an XML file that would detail which file I want to include. But Boo is not a normal language, it is a Super Language. It let me do what I want. And I wanted to have file references. So I did. I love Boo, I really do. The initial sample I started with was this. This is actually on the examples, what do you know. Then I thought about how I wanted to it, and I figured out that I can do this:  import file from&#xA0;&#xA0;anotherFile.boo Boo allows me to modify the compiler object model (AST) at compilation, so I just detect all the imports for the namespace &quot;file&quot;, and then I compile and reference that file. I can even do this:  import file from&#xA0;&#xA0;&quot;~/config/anotherFile.boo&quot; Where ~ is translated to the AppDomain BaseDirectory.  You can find the code here, about 100 lines of code, out of which around 30 could be YAGNIed away. Wasn&#x27;t very hard, and make me love Boo all over again, for what it allows me to do. * Who doesn&#x27;t blog, and&#xA0;a search for &quot;Craig Neuwirt blog&quot; brings back my blog :-) (hint)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So today I practiced diplomacy. We need to integrate with an application that has reached its end of life. It was suggested that since both applications are written with .NET, we can just take the code and build on top of it. I said that I would need to see the code. They sent me the documentation and a link to the current site. I read it, I thought about all the things that I am not going to say. Here is what I did not say:  I found three SQL Injection attacks just by reading the documentation, I looked at the code and had to go and wash my hands. I am going to put that in the WWTT* folder, to look at dark moments, when I am frustrated and need the relief of: &quot;At least I not working on that.&quot; What I did say was:  I do not believe that we can reconcile the architecture of the existing application into our own applications, there are significant and unbridgeable gaps between the two. What we are going to do is to rebuild it using our own architecture and harvest the existing code base to the best of our ability. That is diplomacy. Being polite is another matter, in which you tell someone you hate their guts, but you smile when you do it, and say &quot;if you please&quot; at the end.  * As in What were they thinking?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is something that happens so often I go mad of it.  I had to leave the office at 12:00 to go to a customer, and I wanted to finish a feature first. I arrived early and started working on it. Three hours later, I didn&#x27;t even got started, I was busy fixing stupid assembly version errors, and tracking down dependencies that somehow got lost. Finally I resolved the issues with the abrupt manner of 5kg Hammer and went to fiddle with production databases. The idea is to move anxiety to other people. It worked, eventually, but I had to leave instructions to do a full DB backup and gave the neighbor&#x27;s phone. At 10:35, I got things started, and I soon had everything rolling out, until I got to JS issues with the wrong this reference. Found out how to do it in prototype, found out how to do it jQuery, made it work.&#xA0; Now I had another two hours to get it working, but I was already late. Urgh!  When I got to the customer, we manage to run through scenario &amp; features in a way that was so much more natural. We finished about two days work in 5 hours. I don&#x27;t mind deadlines that are in days / weeks. I like them (or I tell the customer that they are impossible and move on) usually. What I truly hate is a deadline in hours, even if it is not a &quot;deadline&quot; in the usual sense. I just hate knowing that I need to stop working at a certain hour. That seem to always cause me to get to that hour. When I don&#x27;t have that time limit, things go much smoother.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There is a difference between getting a scenario to working and actually finishing it. The first part is just making sure that the tech stuff work, that is generally easy, the hard part is getting all the stuff that you need to take care of taken care of. The biggest problem is that often you don&#x27;t really see those issues. Let us start with an example from today.  Let us have this user story:  As part of the nightly maintenance routines, two days before the event, the system will remind all the participants about the event using SMS. Simple &amp; easy, right?  Here is the code that we started with: [Occurances(OccureEvery.Day)]&#xA;public class SendSmsTwoDaysBeforeEventStart : ScheduledTask&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public override void Execute()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ICollection&lt;Event&gt; eventsInTwoDays = Repository&lt;Event&gt;.FindAll(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Event.ScheduledDate == DateTime.Today.AddDays(2) &amp;&amp;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Event.Participants.With(FetchMode.Join)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;foreach(Event e in eventsInTwoDays)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;SendNotificationSmsToAllParticipantsIn(e);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;Hm, that looks good, doesn&#x27;t it? 8 lines of code, very readable, nothing can go wrong here, right?&#xA;As it turns out, no, there are a few very bad bugs here. Can you spot the first awful bug?&#xA;&#xA;Hint: When does most scheduled tasks run? &#xA;So far, we didn&#x27;t care, so we assume that they would run at night, when no one is using the system. The problem, this way we actually sending the SMS at night. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I would be pissed off if someone sent me an SMS at 2:02 AM.&#xA;There are several ways to handle that, from queued SMS processes to scheduling another execution, etc. We decided that we aren&#x27;t interested in solving this and just added this:&#xA;&#xA;[Occurances(OccureEvery.Day, At = &quot;08:00&quot;)] &#xA;&#xA;So, that took care of the problem for now, at some point, we will add the ability to parse that to the scheduler. Now we can move on to the next story, right? &#xA;&#xA;Nitpicker corner : You probably want to say that I shouldn&#x27;t hard code the hour, but I don&#x27;t care about that, actually, if it become a problem, it will change, but this is the simplest thing that would make the problem go away.&#xA;Take a look at the code above, can you see another problem there? A big serious one? &#xA;&#xA;Hint; Saturday.&#xA;Here you need to understand something about Israel, Saturday is more than the rest day here. I&#x27;ll be short and probably convey the wrong impression, but it is considered, by the religious people, as a day where no fire can be lit, or electricity be used. This is highly inaccurate, but it would suffice for this post. You can read more about it here.&#xA;So, what this basically means is that if you send an SMS to someone on Saturday, it is considered a desecration of the Sabbath. And that actually translate well, surprisingly. Not all people feels like this, I don&#x27;t, for instance, but there are many who do. So, we absolutely must not send SMS on Saturday. &#xA;Okay, that is a simply fix, right?&#xA;public override void Execute() &#xA;{ &#xA;&#x9;if(DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Saturday)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return;&#xA;&#x9;// ...&#xA;Okay, we are done now, right?&#xA;Hm, no. I don&#x27;t really like this code, and we have a bigger problem. Can you see it?&#xA;&#xA;Hint:&#xA0; Holidays&#xA;In Israel, there are many holidays which have the same treatment as Sabbath, and some are even more strict than that. We just had Yom Kippur (day of forgiveness). The PR horror of sending an SMS to even a few hundreds people in Yom Kippur is quite huge. But other holidays should probably be considered as well, so we need to check for those as well. At that point, I said: &quot;I am not dealing with it right now&quot; and wrote the following:&#xA;&#xA;[Occurances(OccureEvery.Day, At = &quot;08:00&quot;, RunAtHolidays = false)] &#xA;Now it is someone&#x27;s else job to fix this so it would work correctly. Mine, probably, but at some later date.&#xA;Are we done yet? Not yet, I am afraid. So, what has gone wrong now?&#xA;&#xA;Hint: DateTime.Today.AddDays(2)&#xA;This does the calculation based on calendar days, but do we really want it to be this way? Considering that we are skipping holidays, we probably want to consider only business days. For that matter, at what time zone are those meeting being held?&#xA;In order to facilitate that, the ScheduledTask base class contains several properties that return the time at various interesting points. (InTwoWeek,InOneMonth, Tomorrow, etc).&#xA;That one is easy, we can just change the query to:&#xA;ICollection&lt;Event&gt; eventsInTwoDays = Repository&lt;Event&gt;.FindAll(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Event.ScheduledDate == InTwoDays &amp;&amp;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Event.Participants.With(FetchMode.Join)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;);&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;That is good, right? Except that here we need to take into account events that occurs during non business days. So we probably want the intersection of the events from the next two days on the calendar and the next two business days.&#xA;The final code now looks like this:&#xA;[Occurances(OccureEvery.Day, At = &quot;08:00&quot;, RunAtHolidays = false)]&#xA;public class SendSmsTwoDaysBeforeEventStart : ScheduledTask&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public override void Execute()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ICollection&lt;Event&gt; eventsInTwoDays = Repository&lt;Event&gt;.FindAll(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Event.ScheduledDate.Between(InTwoCalendarDays, InTwoDays) &amp;&amp; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Event.Participants.With(FetchMode.Join)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;foreach(Event e in eventsInTwoDays)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;SendNotificationSmsToAllParticipantsIn(e);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;Now, I am getting tired of this post, but I am going to leave you with a cliffhanger.&#xA;There is at least one other bug here, can you spot it?</p>
