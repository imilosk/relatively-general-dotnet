            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note, this post was written by Federico. This series relies heavily on the optimization work we did on the optimizing memory comparisons, if you haven&#x2019;t read it, I suggest you start there instead. If memory compare is the bread, memory copy is the butter in an storage engine. Sooner or later we will need to send the data to disk, in the case of Voron we use memory mapped files so we are doing the copy ourselves. Voron also uses a copy-on-write methodology to deal with tree changes, so there are plenty of copy commands around.   Differently from the memory compare case where an optimized version already existed. In the case of memory copy we relied on a p/invoke call to memcpy because we usually move lots of memory around and it is hard to compete in the general case with an assembler coded version.&#xA0; Scrap that, it is not hard, it is extremely hard!!! Don&#x2019;t underestimate the impact that SSE extensions and access to the prefetching operation can have on memcpy. [1]  However, usually not all memory copies are created equally and there is plenty opportunity to do some smart copy; our code wasn&#x2019;t exactly an exception to the rule. The first work involved isolating the places where the actual &#x201C;big copies&#x201D; happen, especially where the cost of actually doing a p/invoke call gets diluted by the sheer amount of data copied [2] in the statistically representative case. You guessed right, for that we used our FreeDB example and the results were very encouraging, there&#xA0; were a couple of instances of &#x201C;big copies&#x201D;. In those cases using the P/Invoke memcpy was not an option, but for the rest we had plenty of different alternatives to try.  The usual suspects to take over our P/Invoke implementation for small copies would be Buffer.BlockCopy, the MSIL cpblk operation and Buffer.Memcpy which is internal, but who cares, we can still clone it .  The general performance landscape for all our alternatives is:  What we can get from this is: Buffer.Memcpy should be the base for any optimization effort until we hit the 2048 bytes where all behave more or less in the same way. If&#xA0; we have to choose between Buffer.BlockCopy and memcpy though, we will select the latter because when running in 32 bits the former is pretty bad. [3]  Having said that, the real eye opener here is the for-loop which is always a bad bet against Buffer.Memcpy. Specially because that&#x2019;s usual strategy followed when copying less than 32 bytes.  There is also another interesting tidbit here, Buffer.Memcpy has some pretty nasty discontinuities around 16 bytes and 48 bytes.  Size: 14 Memcpy: 128 Stdlib: 362 BlockCopy: 223 ForLoop: 213&#xA;Size: 16 Memcpy: 126 Stdlib: 336 BlockCopy: 220 ForLoop: 235&#xA;Size: 18 Memcpy: 170 Stdlib: 369 BlockCopy: 262 ForLoop: 303&#xA;Size: 20 Memcpy: 160 Stdlib: 368 BlockCopy: 247 ForLoop: 304&#xA;Size: 22 Memcpy: 165 Stdlib: 399 BlockCopy: 245 ForLoop: 312&#xA; &#xA;Size: 44 Memcpy: 183 Stdlib: 499 BlockCopy: 257 ForLoop: 626&#xA;Size: 46 Memcpy: 181 Stdlib: 563 BlockCopy: 264 ForLoop: 565&#xA;Size: 48 Memcpy: 272 Stdlib: 391 BlockCopy: 257 ForLoop: 587&#xA;Size: 50 Memcpy: 342 Stdlib: 447 BlockCopy: 290 ForLoop: 674&#xA;Size: 52 Memcpy: 294 Stdlib: 561 BlockCopy: 269 ForLoop: 619&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;What would you do here?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;[1] With RyuJIT there are new vectorised operations (SIMD). We will certainly look for opportunities to implement a fully managed&#xA0; version of memcpy if possible.&#xA;[2] For a detailed analysis of the cost of P/Invoke and the Managed C&#x2B;&#x2B;/CLI Interface you can go the this article: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/253444/PInvoke-Performance&#xA;[3] For detailed metrics check: http://code4k.blogspot.com.ar/2010/10/high-performance-memcpy-gotchas-in-c.html</p>

This seems to be related to having multiple catch statements with the same exception name, but I can&#x2019;t reproduce this in isolation. And it seems that other people have run into it as well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5650868/net-exception-caught-is-unexpectedly-null Worked around it by changing the parameter name&#x2026; but still, really strange.</p>

Was all this trouble worthwhile?  If you remember from the first post in this series, based on our bulk insert scenario I said that each comparison in average takes us 97.5 nanoseconds. Now let&#x2019;s first define what that means.  The most important thing is to understand what are the typical characteristics of this scenarios.   All the inserts are in the same collection. Inserts are in batches and with sequential ids. Document keys share the first 10 bytes. (which is very bad for us but also explains why we have a cluster around 13 bytes). No map-reduce keys (which are scattered all over the place) No indexing happens.  In short, we gave ourselves a pretty bad deal.  We are dealing with a live database here, we can control the scenario, but it is insanely difficult to control the inner tasks as we do with micro-benchmarks. Therefore all percentage gains use call normalization which allows us to make an educated guess of what would have been the gain under the same scenario. The smaller the difference in calls, the less noise or jitter in the measurement.  So without further ado this is the comparison before-after with call normalization.  With our nightmare scenario we get a 10% improvement. We went from 97.5 nanoseconds per compare to 81.5 nanoseconds. Which is AWESOME if we realize we were optimizing an already very tight method.  What this means in context? Let&#x2019;s take a look at the top user on this workload, searching a page.  Before:  After:  It seems that we got better, but also there is something different. Why those gets are missing? In the first batch of optimizations we requested the compiler to aggressively inline those properties, now those properties are part of the call-site with optimized code. A bit off-topic but when optimizing first look for these before going in an optimization frenzy.  This is the search method after optimization.   Our 10% improvement on the Memory Compare gave us almost an extra 4% in the search when bulk inserting. Which for a method that is called in the billions range calls on real life workloads, is pretty damn good.  And this concludes the series about memory compare, hope you have enjoyed it.  PS: With all the information provided, where do you guess I will look afterwards for extra gains?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note, this post was written by Federico. In the previous post  after inspecting the decompiled source using ILSpy&#xA0; we were able to uncover potential things we could do. In the last post we found out that the housekeeping of our last loop is non negligible, but we also know it&#x2019;s execution is bounded by n. From our static analysis we know that n cannot be bigger than a word or 8 bytes.  To build an efficient loop what we can do is exploit our knowledge on how to &#x201C;hint&#x201D; the compiler to build a branch table and build customized code for each one of the cases.  We ended up paying some housekeeping because the code gets unwieldy pretty fast. We know we can still go that road if we need to.  The performance of this loop trades comparisons with branch tables and gets rid of the comparison of n (notice that we have an endless loop here). But to squeeze the latest few nanoseconds there is a very important tidbit that could easily pass inadvertent.  Mileage will vary in real workloads but let&#x2019;s do a couple of assumptions just for the purpose of illustrate the optimization.  Let&#x2019;s say that in half of the requests the memory blocks are equal and on the other half they are not. That means that half of our request will be our worst case scenario, good news is that we have optimized the hell out of it. But what about the other half? For simplicity we will assume that if 2 memory blocks are different there is an uniform probability of it to be different at position n.  That means:   If we are comparing 3 bytes memory blocks there is a chance of 1/3 that byte-1 is different and 2/3 that it&#x2019;s not. If byte-1 of the memory blocks are equal, then there is 1/3 of a chance that byte-2 will be different. &#xA0;And so on.  For the mathematically inclined, this looks like a geometric distribution (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution).  Or the probability distribution of the number X of Bernoulli trials needed to get a desired outcome, supported on the set { 1, 2, 3, ...}  So let&#x2019;s say that we have X compares to do in order to rule out equality of the memory blocks (our worst case scenario).  From Wikipedia:  In our example, the probability p = 0.66.&#xA0; Why? Because that is the probability of &#x201C;successes&#x201D; until we &#x201C;fail&#x201D; &#x2026; You will notice that success and fail are inverted in our case, because what matter to us is the failure. But mathematically speaking using the other probability would be wrong, it is just a matter of interpretation.   Now the important tidbit here is, no matter how long is the memory block (or lower the p-value), the cumulative distribution function will always grow pretty fast. To us, that means that the chances to find a difference in the first X bytes if the memory blocks are different is pretty high. In the context of Voron, let&#x2019;s say we are looking for a particular key out there in a tree. If the keys are spread apart we are going to be able to rule them out pretty fast until we are in the neighborhood of the key, where we will need to check more bytes to know for sure.  The code to achieve this optimization is quite simple, we already used it to optimize the last-loop.   So we just copy the switch block into the entrance of method. If the size of the memory block is 0 to 3, we will have a fast-return. In the case of bigger memory blocks, we will consume the first 4 bytes (32 bits) before starting to test with words.  If I were to modify the original implementation and just add this optimization. What&#x2019;s would the speed up be under this theoretical workload? (I will publish that in the comments section in a couple of days J so make your educated guess).     Ayende&#x2019;s note: That said, there is actually another thing to consider here. It is very common for us to have keys with shared prefixes. For example, &#x201C;users/1&#x201D;, &#x201C;users/2&#x201D;, etc. In fact, we are trying hard to optimize for that route because that gives us a better structure for the internal B&#x2B;Tree that we use in Voron.</p>

In the previous post on the topic after inspecting the decompiled source using ILSpy&#xA0; we were able to uncover potential things we could do. Do you remember the loop from a couple of posts behind?  This loop was the responsible to check for the last bytes; either because the words compare found a difference or we are at the end of the memory block and the last block is not 8 bytes wide. You may remember it easier because of the awful code it generated.  After optimization work that loop looked sensibly different:  And we can double-check that the optimization did create a packed MSIL.    Now let&#x2019;s look at the different operations involved. In red, blue and orange we have unavoidable instructions, as we need to do the comparison to be able to return the result.  13 instructions to do the work and 14 for the rest. Half of the operations are housekeeping in order to prepare for the next iteration.  The experienced developer would notice that if we would have done this on the JIT output each one of the increments and decrements can be implemented with a single assembler operation using specific addressing mode. However, we shouldn&#x2019;t underestimate the impact of memory loads and stores.  How would the following loop look in pseudo-assembler?   :START&#xA;Load address of lhs into register&#xA;Load address of R into raddr-inregister&#xA;Move value of lhs into R&#xA;Load byte into a 32 bits register (lhs-inregister)&#xA;Substract rhs-inregister, [raddr-inregister],&#xA;Load int32 from R into r-inregister&#xA;Jump :WEAREDONE if non zero r-inregister,&#xA;Load address of lhs into lhsaddr-register&#xA;Add 4 into [lhsaddr-register] (immediate-mode)&#xA;Load address of rhs into rhsaddr-register&#xA;Add 4 into [rhsaddr-register]   (immediate-mode)&#xA;Load address of n into naddr-register&#xA;Increment [naddr-register]&#xA; &#xA;Load content of n into n-register&#xA;Jump :START if bigger than zero n-register&#xA;Push 0&#xA;Return&#xA; &#xA;:WEAREDONE&#xA;Push r-inregister&#xA;Return&#xA;&#xA;As you can see the housekeeping keeps being a lot of operations.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Nowadays, notion of composition over inheritance is quite widely accepted. It basically means that when designing a software, you should prefer composition to inheritance, although you could use either one.&#xA; But what if several classes do have some common attributes? Do you need to extract a base class for them?&#xA; When inheritance is not an inheritance In OOP, inheritance stands for &quot;is-a&quot; relation. That is, a class A can be treated as a sub-class of a class B if A *is* a B in a way that makes sense for our particular domain.</p>

I urge you to come an join us. And if you can&#x2019;t make it to QCon, I&#x2019;ll be giving a free talk at Skills Matter on March 5. In this talk, I&#x2019;ll talk about the kind of performance optimizations work that went into RavenDB in the past few months, and what kind of things we had to do to get even more speed out of the system.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I often see developers saying that in most cases, use of IEnumerable breaks LSP. Does it? Let&#x2019;s find out.&#xA; This is the continuation of my article Read-Only Collections and LSP. It this post, I&#x2019;d like to discuss IEnumerable interface from a Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) perspective.&#xA; Liskov Substitution Principle and IEnumerable interface To answer the question whether or not use of IEnumerable breaks LSP, we should step back and see what it means to break LSP.</p>
