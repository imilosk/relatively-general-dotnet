            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Voron uses a fairly standard journaling system to ensure ACID compliance. Whenever you commit a transaction, we write the changed pages to the log. Let us take the simplest example, here is a very simple page:  Now we write the following code:  for(var i = 0; i&lt; 3; i&#x2B;&#x2B; ){   using(var tx = env.NewTransaction(TransactionFlags.ReadWrite))   {       var users = tx.ReadTree(&quot;users&quot;);       users.Add(&quot;Users/&quot; &#x2B; NextUserId(), GetUserData());       tx.Commit();   }}&#xA;After executing this code, the page is going to look like this:&#xA;&#xA;But what is going to happen in the log? We have to commit each transaction separately, so what we end up is the following journal file:&#xA;&#xA;The log contains 3 entries for the same page. Which make sense, because we changed that in 3 different transactions. Now, let us say that we have a crash, and we need to apply the journal. We are going to scan through the journal, and only write Page #23 from tx #43. For the most part, we don&#x2019;t care for the older version of the page. That is all well and good, until incremental backups comes into play.&#xA;The default incremental backup approach used by Voron is simplicity itself. Just create a stable copy of the journal files, and you are pretty much done, there isn&#x2019;t anything else that you need to do. Restoring involves applying those transactions in the order they appear in the journal, and rainbows and unicorns and peace on Earth.&#xA;However, in many cases, the journal files contain a lot of outdated data. I mean, we really don&#x2019;t care for the state of Page #23 in tx #42. This came into play when we started to consider how we&#x2019;ll create Raft snapshots on an ongoing basis for large datasets. Just using incremental backup was enough to give us a lot of promise, but it also expose the issue with the size of the journal becoming an issue.&#xA;That is when we introduced the notion of a minimal incremental backup. A minimal incremental backup is a lot more complex to create, but it actually restore in the exact same way as a normal incremental backup.&#xA;Conceptually, it is a very simple idea. Read the journals, but instead of just copying them as is, scan through them and find the latest version of all the pages that appear in the journal. In this case, we&#x2019;ll have a Page #23 from tx #43. And then we generate a single transaction for all the latest versions of all the pages in the transactions we read.&#xA;We tried it on the following code:&#xA;&#xA;for (int xi = 0; xi &lt; 100; xi&#x2B;&#x2B;){    using (var tx = envToSnapshot.NewTransaction(TransactionFlags.ReadWrite))    {        var tree = envToSnapshot.CreateTree(tx, &quot;test&quot;);        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)        {            tree.Add(&quot;users/&quot; &#x2B; i, &quot;john doe/&quot; &#x2B; i);        }        tx.Commit();    }}&#xA;This is an interesting experiment, because we are making modifications to the same keys (and hence, probably the same pages), multiple times. This also reflects a common scenario in which we have a high rate of updates.&#xA;Min incremental backup created an 8Kb file to restore this. While the standard incremental backup created a 67Kb file for the purpose.&#xA;That doesn&#x2019;t sounds much, until you realize that those are compressed files, and the uncompressed sizes were 80Kb for the minimal incremental backup, and 1.57Mb for the incremental backup. Restoring the min incremental backup is a lot more efficient. However, it ain&#x2019;t all roses.&#xA;An incremental backup will result in the ability to replay transactions one at a time. A min incremental backup will merge transactions, so you get the same end results, but you can&#x2019;t stop midway (for example, to do partial rollback). Taking a min incremental backup is also more expensive, instead of doing primarily file I/O, we have to read the journals, understand them and output the set of pages that we actually care about. &#xA;For performance and ease of use, we limit the size of a merged transaction generated by a min incremental backup to about 512 MB. So if you have made changes to over 512MB of your data since the last backup, we&#x2019;ll still generate a merged view of all the pages, but we&#x2019;ll actually apply that across multiple transactions. The idea is to avoid trying to apply a very big transaction and consume all resources from the system in this manner.&#xA;Note that this feature was developed specifically to enable better behavior when snapshotting state machines for use within the Raft protocol. Because Raft is using snapshots to avoid having an infinite log, and because the Voron journal is effectively the log of all the disk changes made in the system, that was something that we had to do. Otherwise we couldn&#x2019;t rely on incremental backups for snapshots (we would have just switched the Raft log with the Voron journal, probably we no save in space). That would have forced us to rely on full backups, and we don&#x2019;t want to take a multi GB backup very often if we can potentially avoid it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My previous few posts has talked about specific algorithms for gossip protocols, specifically: HyParView and Plumtrees. They dealt with the technical behavior of the system, the process in which we are sending data over the cluster to all the nodes. In this post, I want to talk a bit about what kind of messages we are going to send in such a system. The obvious one is to try to keep the entire state of the system up to date using gossip. So whenever we make a change, we gossip about it to the entire network, and we are able to get to an eventually consistent system in which all nodes have roughly the same data. There is one problem with that, you now have a lot of nodes with the same data on them. At some point, that stop making sense. Usually gossip is used when you have a large group of servers, and just keep all the data on all the nodes is not a good idea unless your data set is very small. So you don&#x2019;t do that.&#xA0; Gossip is usually used to disseminate a small data set, one that can fit comfortably inside a single machine (usually it is a very small data set, a few hundred MB at most). Let us consider a few types of messages that would fit in a gossip setting. The obvious example is the actual topology of the whole network. A node joining up the cluster will announce its presence, and that will percolate to the entire cluster, eventually. That can allow you to have an idea (note, this isn&#x2019;t a certainty) about what is the structure of the cluster, and maybe make decisions based on it. The system wide configuration data is also a good candidate for gossip, for example, you can use gossip as a distributed service locator in the cluster. Whenever a new SMTP server comes online, it announces itself via gossip to the cluster. It is added to the list of SMTP servers in all the nodes that heard about it, and then it get used. In this kind of system, you have to take into account that servers can be down for a long period of time, and miss up on messages. Gossip does not guarantee that the messages will arrive, after all. Oh, it is going to do its best, but you need to also build an anti entropy system. If a server finds that it missed up on too much, it can request one of its peers to send it a full snapshot of the current global state as that peer know it. Going in the same vein, nodes can gossip about the health state of the network. If I&#x2019;m trying to send an email via an SMTP server, and it is down, I&#x2019;m going to try another server, and let the network know that I&#x2019;ve failed to talk to that particular server. If enough nodes fail to communicate with the server, that become part of the state of the system, so nodes that learned about it can avoid that server for a period of time. Moving into a different direction, you can also do gossip queries, that can be done by sending a gossip message on the cluster with a specific query to it. A typical example might be &#x201C;which node has a free 10GB that I can use?&#x201D;. Such queries typically carry with them a timeout element. You send the query, and any matches are sent back to (either directly or also via gossip). After a predefined timeout, you can assume that you got all the replies that you are going to get, so you can operate on that. More interesting is when you want to query for the actual data held in each node. If we want to find all the users who logged in today, for example.  The problem with doing something like that is that you might have a large result set, and you&#x2019;ll need to have some way to work with that. You don&#x2019;t want to send it all to a single destination, and what would you do with it, anyway? For that reason, most of the time gossip queries are actually aggregation. We can use that to get an estimate of certain things in our cluster. If we wanted to get the number of users per country, that would be a good candidate for this, for example. Note that you won&#x2019;t necessarily get accurate results, if you have failures, so there are aggregation methods for getting a good probability of the actual value.  For fun, here is an interesting exercise. Look at trending topics in a large number of conversations. In this case, whenever you would get a new message, you would analyze the topics for this message, and periodically (every second, let us say), you&#x2019;ll gossip to your peers about this. In this case, we don&#x2019;t just blindly pass the gossip between nodes. Instead, we&#x2019;ll use a slightly different method. Each second, every node will contact its peers to send them the current trending topics in the node. Each time the trending topics change, a version number is incremented. In addition, the node also send its peer the node ids and versions of the messages it got from other nodes. The peer, in reply, will send a confirmation about all the node ids and versions that it has. So the origin node can fill in about any new information that it go, or ask to get updates for information that it doesn&#x2019;t have. This reduce the number of updates that flow throughout the cluster, while still maintain an eventually consistent model. We&#x2019;ll be able to tell, from each node, what are the current trending topics globally.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Unlike the previous two posts, this is going to be short. Primarily because what I wanted to talk about it what impresses me most with both HyParView and Plumtree. The really nice thing about them is that they are pretty simple, easy to understand and produce good results. But the fun part, and what make it impressive is that they manage to achieve that with a small set of simple rules, and without any attempt to create a global view. They operate just fine with potentially very small set of the data overall, but still manage to operate, self optimize and get to the correct result. In fact, I did some very minor attempts to play with this at large scale, and we see a pretty amazing emergent behavior. Without anyone knowing what is going on globally, we are able to get to the optimal number of interactions in the cluster to distribute information.  That is really pretty cool. And because this post is too short, I&#x2019;ll leave you with a question. Given that you have this kind of infrastructure, what would you do with it? What sort of information or operations would you try to send using this way?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post, I talked about the Hybrid Partial View protocol, and showed a visualization about how it actually works. Something that is important to note about this protocol, it is mostly meant to create a gossip topology that is resilient to failure. It is not meant to actually send messages, it is meant to serve as the backbone topology (the peer sampling service) for figuring out what are the nodes. The reason for that can be seen in the following 10 node cluster (after running heartbeat enough times to get to a stable state:   Let us assume that we want to disseminate a message across the cluster. We select node A as our root, and then send a message. The rules are as follow:  Each node send the message to all its active connections (except the sender, of course).  A node that got the same message twice will ignore the message. Based on those rules, and the topology above, we&#x2019;re going to have the following chain of messages:  F &#x2013; initial broadcast F -&gt; E, G, J E -&gt; G, I G -&gt; E, H J -&gt; I, H, J H -&gt; C, I C -&gt; B, A B -&gt; D, A A -&gt; B, D D -&gt; A The total number of messages passed is 20. Which is twice as much as the optimal solution would generate. What is worse, this is a very small network, and as the network grows, so will the number of redundant messages. This approach (called eager gossiping) has a major advantage, because it will traverse all paths in the graph, it will also traverse all the shortest paths. That means that the time to get a message from the origin to all nodes is the smallest, but the number of operations is high. The Plumtree paper (Epidemic Broadcast Trees) presents a solution to this problem. It tries to minimize the number of messages while still maintaining both reliability and optimizing the number of messages that are passed as well as the distance they have to pass. The way Plumtree works is explained in quite beautiful detail in the paper, but the underlying idea goes like this, we start using the same approach as the eager gossiping, but whenever we get a message that we already got, we will reply to the source and tell it to stop sending us further messages. This is done so the next time that a message will be sent, we can skip the known duplicate path, and reduce the number of overall messages that we have. So the first run is going to generate 20 messages on the network. The second is going to generate just 13, you can see the non traversed paths in the following image:  Note that we didn&#x2019;t pass any messages between I and J, or D and A. But a lot of the saving was achieved by avoiding duplicate notifications. So node I notified node H, but not vice versa. The next time we&#x2019;ll run this, we have exactly 10 messages passing:  Now, obviously this is pretty cool, but that is under a stable state. What happens when they are failures? Well, at that point, the notion of lazy vs. eager peers come into play. One of the things we did initially was to clear the duplicate paths in the network, so we can optimize the number of messages being passed. That is pretty cool, but it also leave us vulnerable to failures. For example, imagine that nod H is down. What happens then? There are two aspects of this that are interesting. Plumtrees only care about the notion of message passing. They don&#x2019;t deal with topology changes. In this case, the responsibility to join the different parts of the network lies with the peer sampling service, which is HyParView in this case. That would figure out the communication issue, and forge new connections with the remaining nodes. Plumtree will get notified about that, and the process continue. But let us leave that one aside, let us say that we have a static topology, how would Plumtree handle this? Well, at this point you have to realize that Plumtree doesn&#x2019;t just drop a connection when a node tell it that it already heard about a message. It just move it to a lazy state. Periodically, a node will contact other nodes which told it that it wasn&#x2019;t needed and tell them: &#x201C;Hi, I got messages with ids (43,41,81), do you have them?&#x201D;. In this way, a node whose contact point went down would become aware that there are missing messages. At that point, it start a timer, and if it didn&#x2019;t hear about those missing messages, it will ask the node that told it about those messages to send them over, and initiate an active link. The end result here is that we send additional messages, but those tend to be pretty small, just the message ids.   During steady state, we&#x2019;ll just ignore those messages, but if there is a failure, they can help us recover from errors by letting us know that there are messages that we are missing, and taking action to recover that. There is also another important aspect of this behavior, detecting and circumventing slow nodes. If a node is slow to distribute messages to its peers, other nodes will notify those peers that those messages exists, and if that is the case, we&#x2019;ll eventually move to a more efficient topology by routing around that slow node. You can see a full visualization of that (and admire my rapidly improving UI skills) here. The JavaScript implementation of the algorithm is here. Plumtree has a few weaknesses, mostly it is that it is optimized for a single source topology. In other words, the first node you start from will influence the optimization of the network, and if you start a broadcast from another node, it won&#x2019;t be an optimal operation. That said, there are a few ways to handle that. The actual topology remains the same, what influence Plumtree is the rejection replies from nodes that say that the information it transmitted was already received. We can keep track on not only the nodes that rejected us, but the root source of that rejection, so a message originating in E wouldn&#x2019;t stop us from propagating a message originating in J.  Because Plumtree is meant for very large clusters (the paper talks about testing this with 10,000 nodes), and you might have a message originate from any one of those, you probably want to limit the notion of &#x201C;origin&#x201D;, if you track the past three nodes it passed through, you get a reasonably small amount of data that you have to keep, and it is likely to be accurate enough to build multiple topologies that will optimize themselves based on actual conditions. That is it for this post, I&#x2019;ve got a couple more posts that I want to write about gossips, but that would be it for today.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Microsoft has released async/await feature in .Net 4.5. It&#x2019;s a really great stuff as it significantly simplifies one of the most painful areas - asynchronous programming. Before that, Task Parallel Library (TPL) and Parallel LINQ (PLINQ) were released in .Net 4.0. They address problems with parallel programming - another painful area in .Net.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I often see programmers struggling with a question when to use each of these features. Let&#x2019;s step back and recall what does it actually mean to be asynchronous or parallel.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Every once in a while, I like to sit down and read about what is going on outside my current immediate field of interest. This weekend, I chose to focus on efficient information dissemination with very large number of nodes.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The articles of interests for this weekend are HyParView and Epidemic Broadcast Trees (Plumtrees). There are a great read, and complement one another to a nice degree. HyParView is an algorithm that seeks to connect a set (of potentially very large number) of nodes together without trying to make each node connect to each other node. To simplify things, I&#x2019;m going to talk about clusters of several dozens nodes, the articles have both been tested to the 10,000 nodes and with failure rates of up to 95% of the network. This post is here so I can work out the details in my mind, it may be that I&#x2019;m wrong, so don&#x2019;t try to treat this as a definitive source.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Let us assume that we have a network with 15 nodes in it. And we want to add a new node. One way of doing that would be to maintain a list of all the nodes in the system (that are what admins are for, after all) and have the node connect to all the other nodes. In this way, we can communicate between all the nodes very easily. Of course, that means that the number of connections we have in a network of 16(15&#x2B; new) nodes is 120. And that utterly ignore the notion of failure. But let us continue with this path, to see what unhappy landscape it is going to land us on.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We have a 15 node cluster, and we add a new node (so we have to give it all the other nodes), and it connects to all the other nodes and register with them. So far, so good. Now, let us say that there is a state change that we want to send to all the nodes in the network. We can do that by connecting to a single node, and having it distribute this information to all the other nodes. Cost of this would be 16 (1 to talk to the first node, then 15 for it to talk to the rest). That is very efficient, and it is easy to prove that this is indeed the most optimal way to disseminate information over the network (each node is only contacted once).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In a 16 node network, maybe that is even feasible. It is a small cluster, after all. But that is a big maybe, and I wouldn&#x2019;t recommend it. If we grow the cluster size to a 100 node cluster, that gives us about 4,950(!) connections between all nodes, and the cost of sending a single piece of information is still the optimal N. But I think that this is easy to see that this isn&#x2019;t the way to go about it. Mostly because you can&#x2019;t do that, not even for the 16 node cluster. Usually when we talk about clusters we like to think about them as flat topologies, but that isn&#x2019;t actually how it goes. Let us look at a better approximation of a real topology:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Yes, this isn&#x2019;t quite right, but it is good enough for our purposes.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In this 16 node cluster, we have the green node, which is the one we initially contact to send some data to the entire cluster. What would happen if we tried to talk from that node to all the other nodes? Well, notice how much load it would place on the green&#x2019;s node router. Or the general cost for the network in the area of the green node. Because of that, just straight on direct connection for the entire cluster is no something that you really want to do.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;An alternative to do that, assuming that you have a fixed topology is to create a static tree structure, so you start with the green node, it then contacts three other nodes, who then each contact four other nodes. We still have the nice property so that each node is only getting the new information once. But we can parallelize the communication and reduce the load on a single segment of the network.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Which is great, if we have a static topology and zero failures. In practice, none of those is true, so we want something else, and hopefully something that would make this a lot easier to handle. This is where HyParView comes into play. I sat down and wrote a whole big description of how HyParView works, but it wasn&#x2019;t something that you couldn&#x2019;t get from the article. And one of the things that I did along the way was create a small implementation in JavaScript and plug this into a graph visualization, so I could follow what is going on there.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That means that I had to implement the HyParView protocol in JavaScript, but it turned out to be a great way to actually explore how the thing works, and it ended up with great visualization.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You can see it in action in this url, and you can read the actual ocde for the HyParView protocol here.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is the cluster at 5 nodes, just after we added E:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And here it is at 9 nodes, after it had a chance to be stable.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Note that we have the connections (active view) from each node to a up to 3 other nodes, but we also have other letters next to the node name, in []. That is the passive list, the list of nodes that we are not connected to, but will try if our connection to the one of the active list goes down.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In addition to just adding themselves to one of the nodes, the nodes will also attempt to learn the topology of the network in such a way that if there is a failure, they can recover from it. The JavaScript code I wrote is not a good JavaScript code, that isn&#x2019;t my forte, but it should be enough to follow what is going on there. We are able to do very little work to have a self organizing system of nodes that discover the network.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Note that in large networks, none of the nodes would have the full picture of the entire network, but each node will have a partial view of it, and that is enough to send a message through the entire network. But I&#x2019;m going to talk about this in another post.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In the meantime, go to&#xA0;this url&#xA0;and see it in action, (the actual ocde for the HyParView protocol&#xA0;here). Note that I&#x27;ve made the different action explicit, so you need to do heartbeats (and the algorithm relies on them for healing failures) to get proper behavior for the system. I&#x27;ve also created a predictable RNG, so we can always follow the same path in our iterations.</p>
