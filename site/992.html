            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x27;ve often spoke of how much I want an easy-to-use bug tracking software, but I never did much about it since no free package was able to&#xA0;satisfy everything that I needed. Specifically, free, open source and working with MySQL. A big plus would&#x27;ve been if it would&#x27;ve been written in C# or Boo.     Now, bug tracking is certainly not a hard problem, is mostly direct work against database, some reports and a lot of thinking about work flow. Beyond that, it&#x27;s mostly grunt work of adding features that are neccecary, but quite boring. (Prove me wrong, show me a feature of a bug tracking system that excites you.) Create a way to search bugs with enough flexibility is a must, for example, but it isn&#x27;t really interesting.    I&#x27;ve now found a package that I&#x27;m glad to be able to use: FlySpray&#xA0;is a free (LGPL) bug tracking software that has quite a bit of features that I consider neccecary, has a good UI (unlike some other systems) and seems to be capable. It has one big minus as far as I&#x27;m concerned, which is that it&#x27;s written in PHP. I don&#x27;t have anything against PHP*, but it does bring back the bad old days of ASP and the mess that can happen there.    Unline the&#xA0;usual, the longest part was not cutomizing the UI to integrate with the rest of the site (although it took quite some time). The long part was integrating with the bug tracking system (and vice versa). It had to do with writing shell scripts on a remote system which I only have shell access to. I&#x27;m not&#xA0;a unix guy, and shell scripts require some deep knowledge in the ability of the system in order to get them to work as expected. I couldn&#x27;t even get the script to execute properly and in the end I just used FlySpray&#x27; script as is. In addition: command line editing seems to require far too much knowledge.     Anyway, you can see the latest addition to my sites here: http://bugs.ayende.com    * I was able to understand enough that I could dig in the code and fix some problems without ever writing a single line of PHP code.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x27;ve a strange problem, I want to allow access to my blog using http://blog.ayende.com/ but the way that sub domains are implemented on my host gets in the way. The problem is that it&#x27;s possible to access sub domains by doing: http://www.ayende.com/blog/, so in essense I&#x27;ve two physical paths to the same place. Usually it means that I would&#x27;ve to take care for paths in the html, but here I&#x27;ve another problem.    The root site, http://www.ayende.com/ runs Cuyahoga&#xA0;and this require that the blog application (dasBlog) to remove several httpModules in its own web.config. That didn&#x27;t cause troubles so far, but now that I want to change the path, I&#x27;m getting very nasty error about the non existing httpModules that I&#x27;m removing.    So right now I can either:            Remove the entries from the web.config, which will enable blog.ayende.com but not www.ayende.com/blog                Keep the entries, which will kill www.ayende.com/blog&#xA0;but enable blog.ayende.com&#xA0;(and better seperation between the applications).    Any suggestions how to make it work? Currently I&#x27;m going with the second method so as not to break links.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just spent an hour tracking a bug in Dynamic Proxy, I solved it and was about to send a patch when I run svn update and got a few conflicts. Imagine my horror to discover that the bug has already been fixed (and in a better way), that will teach me to always update before doing work, I guess.    Anyway, there is a new version that fix a problem with overloaded indexers that you can use. Since all I did was merely to update the dynamic proxy dll, I edited the bulid script a little bit, just to feel better :-), this release also offer fix for calling virtual method in the constrcutor, which used to throw.    http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just read this post&#xA0;which isn&#x27;t really about college, but more about life choices.    I&#x27;ve to say that the way I understand the college system in the USA is that upon finishing high school a person is expect to go to college and get a degree in something, after which it&#x27;s possible to find a &quot;good&quot; job somewhere. The advantages are that it get the kids out of the home and hopefully teach some independance (and how to throw a party). It works quite differently here; upon finishing high school you get draft to the Army, which more or less takes care for teaching you how to rely on yourself and how to handle responsability.    I decided not to continue in the army for a very simple reason, even though I currently am in a position where I&#x27;ve a good job, with very good advancement path and the ability to plan for a very long range. Why, you (and most of the immediate family :-) ) ask? For a very simple reason, that is not what I want to do with my life. When I get up in the morning and I think &quot;Let&#x27;s just get through this day&quot; I know that I&#x27;m not enjoying myself. And that is not a way to live your life.    About the usefulness of college*, I know that the chief reason I want to go is to have solid theory that I can implement. I sometimes find myself struggling with things that should be simple if I can just get the idea, but to get that I need this, and for this I need just the one over there, etc. I probably can learn those subjects (compiler theory, math - with all the fields attached, advance algorithms, AI, etc) on my own, but it would be much harder and I probably would only learn the least that I need to do something, and that is not good. The moment I&#x27;ve a firm foundation, I could use that to built much more.    * Is there a difference between college and university? I don&#x27;t think so and in here we only have universities.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For the last week or so I read ~12 books, and I think that I&#x27;m starting to suffer from reading overload. The main problem is lack of motivation to read, which mean that the next book (Owlflight, currently) has better be good, otherwise I&#x27;ll have to take some rest.     I usually don&#x27;t have a problem with too much reading, but it&#x27;s been a while since I grokked three books a day, every day. I usually try to find a more balanced way between reading, computers and real life; but the vacation and the amazon&#x27;s package arrival date were just too fortunate to pass.    &quot;Justify my text? I&#x27;m sorry but it has no excuse.&quot; -- Tech Support Slogan    &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.&quot; -- Tech Support Slogan    &quot;You might have mail.&quot; -- Tech Support Slogan</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The Oathbound  Oathbreakers  Oathblood     These books cover a time frame of two generations from the current time, and they are quite different from each other. The first is an attempt to bind together several short stories in chronological order and turn them into a single entity, the second is a full fledged book on its own and the third is a collection of short stories.    I really liked Oathbreakers, it&#x27;s a powerful story which is told masterfully. What I had problem with is the first book; the stories are very good, and I certainly enjoyed reading them, but there were few problems in the translation from a collection of short stories to a book that made for some rough time. First, this book start after a short story that doesn&#x27;t appear in the book (strangely enough, it appears as the first short story in the third book; who said that logic has anything to do with it?) and while the story are following each other chronologically, they weren&#x27;t edited much to a book form.    The problem is that each short story contains some introduction that is not needed when it&#x27;s in a book format. It gets annoying to read the introduction for a character for the fifth time. But beyond that, the story themselves are really good. I especially liked the consecutive demon stories.    The third book is simply an anthology of short stories (sadly, some that appear in the first), I don&#x27;t really like short stories, especially when I read them all together, but those were really good. I&#x27;m used to anthologies of varying quality, but these were quite good.</p>

We are introduced to many more countries, and get a Karsite hero (Alberich doesn&#x27;t count, he defected) and a look at how those countries works.    Those books have a high level of intrigue and back stabbing going on that weren&#x27;t apperant in any of the previous books, and the focus seems to be different. If in the previous books the focus of the books was a small group (less than 5, usually) with a spesific task, then these books cover several dozens of characters and many sub plots.    Personally, I liked the previous books more; there isn&#x27;t enough action, even though there is a lot going on, it&#x27;s far more... sedate, I think. It&#x27;s still very important set of books, since it discuss quite a lot of the... theory behind the world of Valdamer.</p>
