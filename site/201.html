            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Before heading to the C&#x2B;&#x2B; implementation, I thought I would take the time to just walk through the FASTER codebase as it is performing a simple operation. The access violation error that I previously run into has been fixed, so I could run the benchmark. Here is my configuration:I got the following results, when running on a single thread.Total 142,603,719 ops done&#xA0; in 30 secs.This is about 4.7 million operations per second, which is certainly nice. I then decided to compare this to ConcurrentDictionary to see what kind of performance that would give me. I made the following changes, which I&#x2019;ll admit are pretty brute force way to go about it. But note that this is probably significantly less efficient then I could probably write it. Nevertheless, using ConcurrentDictionary with a single thread in the same benchmark gives me:Total 84,729,062 ops done&#xA0; in 30 secs.There isn&#x2019;t much call for using this on a single thread, though. My machine has 20 cores, so let&#x2019;s see what happens when I give FASTER its head, shall we?2,330,054,219 ops done&#xA0; in 30.021 secs.That is impressive, with about 77,668,473 operations per second. On the other hand, this is what happened when I run with 20 threads and ConcurrentDictionary:671,071,685 ops done&#xA0; in 30.024 secs.This gives us &#x201C;only&#x201D; 22,369,056 operations per second. It is clear that FASTER is much better, right? The problem is that it isn&#x2019;t much faster enough. What do I mean by this? I used idiomatic C# for the ConcurrentDictionary usage and got with 1/4 of FASTER&#x2019;s perf. The FATER codebase is doing native calls and unsafe manipulation, dedicated allocation, etc. I expect to get better perf at that point, but &#x201C;merely&#x201D; 400% improvement isn&#x2019;t enough for the kind of effort that was put into this. I run the concurrent dictionary in a sampling profiler, with 20 threads, and I got the following results. On the other hand, using FASTER for the same scenario gives:This is really interesting. You can see that the FASTER option spends all its time in either: InternalUpsert or inside the RunYcsb method (which is actually the store.Read() method that was inlined). What is more interesting is that there are no additional calls there. The InternalUpsert call is 219 lines of code, and the code uses [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)] quite aggressively (pun intended). On the other hand, the ConcurrentDictionary implementation has to make virtual method calls on each call. There are several ways to handle this, including using generic struct that can eliminate most of the virtual calls. This is effectively what FASTER is doing, without the generics. FASTER also benefits from pre-allocating everything upfront. If you&#x2019;ll look at the profiler results, you can see that these are the major source of &#x201C;slowness&#x201D; in the benchmark.Given the nature of the benchmark, I feel that it is unfair to compare FASTER to persistent data stores and it should be compared more closely to a concurrent hash map. Given that this is effectively what FASTER is doing in this showcase benchmark, that seems a lot more fair. I checked the literature and we have this paper talking about concurrent hash maps where we see (Figure 2.a) numbers that near to 300 millions ops/sec for pure writes and 600 millions ops/sec for reads.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last post commented on the FASTER paper, now I&#x2019;m getting to reading the code. This is a pleasant change of scenery for me, since FASTER is written in C# (there is a C&#x2B;&#x2B; port that I&#x2019;ll also be going through later). As someone who spend most of their time in C#, that make it much easier to go through the code. On the other hand, this was clearly written by someone who spent most of their time in C&#x2B;&#x2B;. This means that naming conventions and the general approach to writing the code sometimes directly contradict C# conventions. Some of that really bugs me.The first thing I did was to try to run the benchmark on my own machine, to get relative numbers. It died with an AccessViolationException, which was a disappointment. I&#x2019;m going to ignore that and just read through the code. One thing that I did noticed when reading through the benchmark code is that this piece:This maps closely to some of the things they mentioned in the paper, where each thread refresh every 256 ops and complete pending operations every 65536 ops. The reason I call this out is that having this done in what effectively is a client code is a bad idea in term of design. The benchmark code is operating under continuous stream of operations and can afford to amortize such things. However, real code need to deal with client code that isn&#x2019;t well behaving and you can&#x2019;t assume that you&#x2019;ll be operating in this kind of environment.Based on the semantics discussed in the paper and what the code is showing me, I would assume that the general model for actually using this is to spawn off a bunch of threads and then listen to some data source. For example, a socket. On each network read, the thread would apply a batch of operations. Note that this means that you have to deal with threads that may be arbitrarily delayed. I would expect that under such a scenario, you&#x2019;ll see a very different performance profile. You won&#x2019;t have all threads working in tandem and staying close to one another. When getting to the code itself, I started with the native portions, trying to figure out what FASTER is doing with the lowest level of the system. It is mostly advanced file operations (things like telling the OS to don&#x2019;t defrag files, allow to allocate disk space without zeroing it first, etc). As far as I can see, this isn&#x2019;t actually being called from the current code, but I assume that they at least tested out this approach. Another native code they have is related to calling __rdtsc(), which they use in the HiResTimer class. This can be replaced completely by the .NET Stopwatch class and I believe that dropping the adv-file-ops and readtsc native projects is possible and straightforward, allowing for a fully managed FASTER impl. Note that it is still using a lot of interop calls, it seems, but at least so far, I think that most of them are not necessary. To be fair, given the way the code is structured, a lot of the native code is about I/O with pointers, which until the Great Spanification in .NET Core was PITA to deal with.In general, by the way, the code reads more as a proof of concept than a production codebase. I notice this in particular with the general approach for errors handling. Here are two examples:This is from the native code, from which it is a PITA to return errors. However, writing to the console from a library is not an error reporting strategy. What really bugged me was this code, from the MallocFixedPageSize code:If there is any error in the process of pinning memory, just ignore it? Leave the memory pinned? Here is another example that made me cringe:Moving on to the CodeGen directory, it gets interesting. The paper talks about dynamic code generation, but I didn&#x2019;t expect to see such wide usage of this. In particular, large sections of the code (13 files, to be exact, over 6000 lines of code) are dynamically loaded, transformed and compiled on the fly when you create the hashtable. I understand the reasoning for this, you want to get the JIT to compile the best possible code that it can for the specific operations you execute. However, this make it pretty hard to follow what is going on there. In particular, code generating code make it harder to follow what end up actually going on. There are also better ways to do it. Either through generic struct parameters to specialize the code or only generating the dedicated connecting methods as needed and not recompiling large portions on the fly. The Device directory isn&#x2019;t really interesting. Mostly pretty trivial I/O operations, so I&#x2019;m not going to discuss it in depth.Next, getting to the Epoch, which was really interesting to read in the paper. The actual implementation raise a few questions. The Epoch value in an 32 bits integer, that means that it will wrap fairly quickly. It looks like the Epoch is bumped every time you need a new page. Given the operations rate that are reported, I would expect it to happen on a regular basis (this is also required for the system to progress properly and sync up). My reading is that wrapping of the Epoch counter will result in Bad Things Going On.There there is this:Size, in this case, is always set to 128. The size of Entry is 64 bytes, this means that this call will allocate 8,320 bytes in Gen0, immediately pin it and never let it go. This is going to result in memory fragmentation. It would be better to allocate this on the Large Object Heap and avoid the issue. In fact, the same issue can be seen in the memory allocation, where the code does:In This case, PageSize is 65,536, however, and given any value except a byte, this will automatically go to the Large Object Heap anyway. I&#x2019;m going to be a bit ungenerous here, but I&#x2019;m not sure if this was intentional or not.I&#x2019;m firmly convinced that this is pure POC code, here is the snippet that finally did it for me, from the BumpCurrentEpoch() code. Note that I don&#x2019;t mind the Thread.Sleep() here, it make sense in context, but the Console.WriteLine cinched the deal for me. This is not something that you can take a use, but something to look at as you implement this properly.I have to say that I find it very hard to go through the code, mostly because it&#x2019;s in C# and there are certain expectations that I have from the code which are routinely violated. I think that I&#x2019;m going to stop reading the C# codebase and switch over to the C&#x2B;&#x2B; implementation. I expect this to be more idiomatic, both because it is the second time this was written and because the people writing the code are clearly more using to writing in C&#x2B;&#x2B;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The FASTER is a fast key-value store from Microsoft. It&#x2019;s paper was published a while ago and now that the source is available, I thought that I would take a peek. You might say that I have a professional interest in such a project .I decided to read the paper first before reading the code, because I want to figure out what isn&#x2019;t in the paper. The implementation details beyond the abstract are what I find most interesting, to be honest. But if I&#x2019;m going to read the paper, I&#x2019;m also going to add some comments on it. Please note that the comments are probably not going to make much sense unless you read the paper.The Epoch Basic section explains how they use a global epoch counter with a thread local value and a shared table that marks what epochs are visible to each thread. They use this to provide synchronization points, I assume (don&#x2019;t know yet). This resonates very strongly with how LMDB&#x2019;s global transaction table operates. I like the concept of the drain list which is executed whenever an epoch become safe. I would assume that they use that to let the clients know that their operation was accepted and what was its state.I wasn&#x2019;t able to figure out what they use the tag for in the hash bucket entry. I think that the way it works is that you have K hash buckets and then use the first K bits to find the appropriate bucket, then scan for a match on the last 15 bits. I&#x2019;m not really sure how that work with collisions, though. I assume that this will be clearer when I get to the code. I like the two phase scan approach to ensure that you have no conflicts when updating an entry. The paper keeps repeating the speed numbers of 160 millions ops/sec and talking about 20 millions ops / sec as being &#x201C;merely&#x201D;. Just based on my reading so far, I don&#x2019;t see how this can happen. What is interesting to me is what is the definition of ops. Is it something like incrementing the same (small) set of counters? If that is the case, than the perf numbers both make more sense and are of less interest. Typically when talking about ops / sec in such scenarios we talk about inserts / updates to individual documents / rows / objects. Again, I don&#x2019;t know yet, but that is my thinking so far.One thing that I find sad is that this isn&#x2019;t a durable store. A failure in the middle of operations would cause some data to be completely lost. It seems like they have support for checkpoints, so you don&#x2019;t lose everything. However, I&#x2019;m not sure how often that happens and the benchmarks they are talking about were run without it. Interestingly enough, the benchmarks were run without garbage collection. I haven&#x2019;t gotten to the discussion on that yet, so I&#x2019;m not exactly what that means Another missing feature here is that there is no support for atomicity. You cannot ensure that two separate operations will run as a single atomic step. The benchmark machine is 28 cores with 256GB RAM and 3.2 TB NVMe drive. This is a really nice machine, but from the get go I can tell that this is not going to be a fair comparison to&#xA0; most other storage engines. Faster is explicitly designed to work mostly in memory and with high degree of parallelism. This is great, but it gives us some important features (atomic batches and durability, also known as transactions). The data size they tested are:250 million records with 8 bytes keys &amp; 8 bytes values &#x2013; Just under 4GB in total.250 million records with 8 bytes keys &amp; 100 bytes values &#x2013; Just under 32GB in total.I&#x2019;m not sure why they think that this is going to provide larger than memory setup. In particular, they mention a memory budget of 2GB, but I assume that this is just internal configuration. There is also going to be quite a lot of memory cached in the OS&#x2019; page cache, for example, and I don&#x2019;t see anything controlling that. Maybe I&#x2019;ll when I&#x2019;ll go through the code, though.Okay, the garbage collection they refer to is related to how they compact the log. They use an interesting approach where they just discard it at a some point, and any pointer to the removed section is considered to be deleted automatically. That is likely to be very efficient, assuming that you don&#x2019;t care about older data. All in all, I feel that I have a vague understanding on how Faster works and a lot better grasp on what it does and how it is utilized. I&#x2019;m looking forward to diving into the code.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Just asked a candidate to do a task that requires an O(1) retrieval semantics.&#xA0; Off the top of his head, he answered that he would us a Trie.&#xA0; That is an exciting new development in phone interviews, since this data structure doesn&#x2019;t come up all too often.I asked him to explain why he didn&#x2019;t chose a dictionary as the underlying data structure. His answer was&#x2026; illuminating.He explained (in detail, and correctly) how hash maps work, that they rely on probability to ensure their O(1) guarantees and that he didn&#x2019;t feel that he could select such a data structure for O(1) performance before analyzing the distribution of the data and figuring out if there are too many expected collisions in the data set.All pretty much text book correct. In fact, if one is writing their own hash map (don&#x2019;t do that) that is a concern you need to take into account. But in the real world, this is usually a solved problem. There are certain malicious inputs that can get you into trouble and there are certain things you need to take into account if you are writing your own hash function. But for the vast majority of cases and scenarios, you don&#x2019;t need to worry about this at all.The candidate is a student in the last stages of his degree and it shows. He gave a wonderful answer, if this was a test. It was just so wonderfully wrong.</p>

The thread started with DHH calling out this job posting:I&#x2019;ve marked the important piece. You can read the twitter thread for the gory details. Based on the job posting and the interaction of the CEO on twitter, I&#x2019;m going to assume that this job pay six to nine times more than the average developer can make, because otherwise I can&#x2019;t really figure out why anyone would work in such a place. I have had two (or three) separate burnouts before I was thirty. I was single, no kids, and I worked crazy hours. I was productive and I burned out. Mid 2009 was a fun time for me, I was physically nauseous every time I sat in front of a computer&#xA0; and seriously considered a career shift to construction. A large number of life decisions were made as a result of that. And while I admit that being young and discovering things is its own reward, this isn&#x2019;t really something new. Workplace productivity is not an unexplored subject and I would expect anyone in either HR or management position (and certainly a CEO in a company that is busy hiring people) to be at least peripherally aware of them.&#xA0; You might sometime need to work crazy hours, I fully understand crunch time and &#x201C;OMG, production is DOWN&#x201D;. But if you do that, you need to understand that this is done with eyes open.&#xA0; Such scenarios should be rare and you should be aware that any temporary increase in productivity will need to be paid off by reduced productivity down the line. Again, this isn&#x2019;t new. You can go to Ford in the early years on the last century to read more about how to increase productivity. So asking for 60 hours per week on an ongoing basis is pretty&#x2026; crazy.Let&#x2019;s assume that this is for five days a week position, shall we? Based on the job posting on the CEO&#x2019;s behavior on Twitter, I assume that it isn&#x2019;t the case, but humor me.This means, Monday to Friday, you start working at 9 AM and finish at 9 PM. If you have kids, this means never reading them a bed time story, not being able to see them perform, never coming to PTA meeting. If you have a spouse, it means a relationship that is mostly around texts, because you ain&#x2019;t going to see them.&#xA0; If you don&#x2019;t have a significant other, good luck finding one with the time allotted.&#xA0; But 12 hours days are probably not going to cut it. So let&#x2019;s say that you work only 10 hours a day, but we&#x2019;ll include Sunday as well, to make up for the &#x201C;lost time&#x201D;. You still log in at 9AM, but now you get to leave at 7 PM. Oh, and if you better not be sick, or have to drive your mom to the airport or need to visit the DMV. Nobody got any time for that. On a more serious note. This kind of environment will make you sick. It can take a lot of time to recover from that, both mentally and physically. I can&#x2019;t imagine anyone who would be signing up for something like that. Actually, I can, quite easily. There are plenty of professions where this is normal. To pick examples off the top of my head, lawyers, nurses and doctors all work crazy hours, or at least, that is the impression I have. Let&#x2019;s check, shall we? The following results are pretty much the first result of googling the question.Lawyers, for example, can expect to work 60&#x2B; hours a week on average. Nurses, on the other hand, are considered full time if they work about 36 &#x2013; 40 hours a week.Doctors, vary wildly, with 40 - 80 hours, depending on the type of specialty and where they are in their career. The key here, for both lawyers and doctors, is that typically after a pretty harsh initial period, you can expect to gain a lot for your work. In other words, there is a high probability that there is going to be a good return on this investment.&#xA0; For this job posting, again based solely on the text and the CEO&#x2019;s behavior, I&#x2019;m assuming there is no such upside. Whenever we sent job acceptance letter, I used to put in a statement about Hibernating Rhinos being a place where you didn&#x2019;t have to leave the office at 9 PM. Since then we grew a bit and got a few people who are a night owls, so they come later to the office. That somewhat spoils this statement, but I can still state that no one works crazy hours. By the way, that is not because some of the devs haven&#x2019;t tried. I&#x2019;m very familiar with the excitement of being almost there. At the cusp of figuring out this bug or completing that feature. It sometimes make sense to keep going and complete just this one task and getting there. And this is fine, if you pace yourself. But with some people, I had to tell them that if they keep staying so much in the office, I&#x2019;m going to start charging them rent. That seemed to do the trick. When I founded Hibernating Rhinos, I wanted to create a place that I would like which would give me interesting things to work on . In the decade that Hibernating Rhinos has been around, I don&#x2019;t believe that we ever had a crunch time that didn&#x2019;t directly relate to a customer problem (and these tend to be rare) . Whenever I had to make the choice, slipping the release date has always been the better option in my eyes rather than sacrificing quality or keeping people at their desk to try to get more done. This includes the last three years in which our team basically rebuilt a distributed database from the ground up and gotten a minimum of 10x performance improvement across the board. This was without anyone expected to put in sunrise to sundown shifts. Given that I think that this is about creating a marketing/sales platform. I&#x2019;m&#x2026; not impressed by that. In fact, I&#x2019;m pretty sure that if they start out with planning to squeeze their own people dry from the get go they have the same level of cluelessness in other aspects of the business. On the other hand, assuming that they actually manage to get a viable product out, someone is going to have a field day threading through all the holes that tired, listless and demotivated developers have left in the system. I think that I can summarize all of this post in a single word: BEWARE!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After we built the SQL Migration Wizard for RavenDB 4.1, we started to field questions about assistance in migrating from more databases. As a result of this, we have introduced a support for MongoDB and CosmosDB migration.I&#x2019;m going to walk you through how this works. First, you&#x2019;ll need to download the Release Candidate of RavenDB 4.1. In addition to the zip package, you&#x2019;ll need to download the Tools zip file as well. Next, run RavenDB and create a new database, then go to Settings &gt; Import Data and select From other. Here is what this will look like:I went to shodan.io and found a publicly available MongoDB server to test this out. The process completed successfully and gave me a single document:I guess someone already got to this instance. More seriously, I scanned literally the first page in this listing and was able to connect and retrieve real documents from a few of them. That included what looked like users (hashed) passwords, among other details. I deleted the dataAt any rate, you can use this wizard to pull data from a MongoDB instance to your RavenDB database. RavenDB will handle all the details of the transfer for you. There is even the option to use a transformation script to shape the data as it goes into RavenDB.You can do the same for CosmosDB, as you can see below:These credentials I got from doing a GitHub search. On the one hand, I&#x2019;m really happy that the feature works. On the other hand, I&#x2019;m pretty much in a state of despair from the state of security in general.We are looking into other databases that our users want to migrate from. If you have such a need, please let us know.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last Friday, without much of a fanfare, we released the Release Candidate of RavenDB 4.1. This release concludes about six months of work to bring some new and awesome features to the table:Cluster wide transactionsJavaScript indexesSQL Migration WizardDistributed CountersRavenDB Embedded (for .Net, Python, etc)MongoDB &amp; CosmosDB migrationResults highlightingSubscription includesExplain query planExplain query executionQuery timingBetter setup wizard and reducing deployment frictionAnd these are just the first dozen big features. We made a lot of improvements, supporting wild card certificate generation in the setup process, better spatial units support and a plenty of other stuff that isn&#x2019;t sexy or attractive on its own but adds up to a major jump in what you can do with RavenDB.</p>
