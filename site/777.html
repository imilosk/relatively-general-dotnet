            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My main pain point with R# is very simple, when it generates properties or methods, it doesn&#x27;t generate virtual ones. Since I tend to generate quite a few properties at one go, it is a pain to have to go and add it to all of them.    Currently the issue is marked as &quot;Not for 3.0&quot;, which is something that I would like to change, please visit the issue and vote for it: http://www.jetbrains.net/jira/browse/RSRP-26697</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I would preface by saying that I am using Web Forms at my current project because the client insisted. They are paying, they get to make the decisions, end of story. This is a rant, plain and simple. I don&#x27;t do those often, but I have too much annoyances lately to not do it. I have several years of working with Web Forms, in projects of various sizes, I have committed my Sins Against the GridView, and have memorized the page lifecycle, I have walked the path of Page.ProcessRequest, and learnt at a distant monastery about the mysteries of the ViewState, I have studied the intricate play of control&#x27;s events and the secrets of Data Binding. I get Web Forms. I know how they work.  I have detailed elsewhere what I don&#x27;t like about WebForms (trying to be stateful, complex, lying, etc). Today it had gotten to the point when I have given up on trying anymore.&#xA0;This was after we have been hitting, repeatedly, obstacle after obstacle with using Web Forms. Today we had no less than three such incidents, all of them related to various intricate ways that the whole messy pipeline is working together to create a results that is more complex than the sum of all its parts and the legacy systems on the next door. Today was far from being an exception. We didn&#x27;t even try to do anything complex. Take a bunch of objects, bind them to a GridView, rinse-repeat.&#xA0;There was a set of pages that were almost literally forms over data, exactly the use case for WebForms, or so I have thought. In a set of about a dozen pages, with really minor differences between one another, we had at least one serious problem at each page. Invariably it was related to some weird way WebForms expected me to work.  In order to get the data from the request, I need to bind the data again in page load, and in a later event, I need to process it, after the Web Forms engine had magically filled the values from the request. And woe upon you if you dare to mix a data source with a call to this.DataBind(); for you are heretic and deserve to lose the user&#x27;s input without warning, and only by the grace of the good lord will you be saved. At one point today I resorted to an http handler and a set of calls to Response.Writer(), because that was easier than trying to get the functionality from the WebForms engine. At this point, I feel like I am trying to build on top of a house of cards, with the slightest movement will send everything crumbling down. I found a bug that was totally my fault today, and we had about five minutes of hilarity about finally finding something that we could easily fix. While this is a very instructive in terms of knowing how the internals of the WebForms engine works, it is a complete waste of time otherwise. When I need to be absolutely aware, at all times, about all the implications of what is going on all around me, I can&#x27;t really do anything at all. I have learned my lessons from past projects, thou shall not try to be smart with the WebForms framework, it will be smart right back at you and bit you in the ass. I am not trying to do anything smart here. I am literally scaling down everything that I do on the UI layer to the set of what is wholly approved and blessed by Microsoft. I am not even trying to workaround technical limitation, I am just trying to build working software. At this point, I am more willing to debug Dynamic Proxy&#x27;s IL generation engine than my pages, because at least with Dynamic Proxy, I have some control over what is going on, hard as it may be. The WebForms engine gives the illusion of control, but it does things in completely arbitrary ways, contrary to the principal of least surprised and common sense.  I am sick of it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Dan Simmons&#xA0;is talking about persistence ignorance in the Entity Framework. It looks like Microsoft is going to make an effort to make the EF support at least some level of PI in V1, and pure PI in following versions. This is a Good Thing. I would like to talk about some of the details in his post:  There&#x27;s no question, though, that complete persistence ignorance comes at a price--both in the performance of applications built with &quot;pure POCO&quot;, persistence ignorant domain models and as a result in the complexity of the entity framework which enables them. There is a question, actually. I can&#x27;t speak of the complexity of the EF, but I can speak about the framework requirements from OR/M solution that wants to support persistence ignorance.&#xA0;From the rest of the post, it looks like trying to do PI in the EF is going to have some issues with the existing infrastructure. Dan is bringing up two issues:  They must store a copy of an EntityKey. Proposed solution: Choosing not to store EntityKeys on the entities, for instance, means that navigating from an entity to the ObjectStateEntry&#xA0;which matches it either requires a brute-force search of the ObjectStateManager or for the ObjectStateManager to maintain a dictionary mapping from CLR reference to ObjectStateEntry which is a significnat expense.My reaction: You are going to need to keep track of loaded objects anyway, because you need to do identity resolution, this almost guarantees that you are already keeping track of this somewhere, why not utilize it for the same purpose?Also, what is the significant expense in keeping a dictionary of &lt;EntityKey, Entity&gt; ?  They must provide change tracking notifications through a prescriptive interface.Proposed solution: Not supporting the change tracking mechanism means that the ObjectStateManager must cache a copy of the original values for each entity (all original values and they must be cache whether or not the entity is modified).My reaction: The way you do it now is basically the same, only they are not in the state manager, but in the entity itself, what is the big difference? There is a case here because of value types copy semantics (entities are usually composed of values types and strings), but I don&#x27;t think that it is a big issue, in most cases, the lifetime of both entities and the session cache is short.If it bothers you, you can implement change tracking by interception, and add only the modified values to the ObjectStateManager. One thing that is really encouraging is the suggestion that users of the EF will be able to use custom collections. They are extremely helpful in a number of scenarios. I already mentioned the temporal aware collections that hooked into NHibernate in order to give us much better domain model. The last I have heard, it was not supported in the EF. So it is good to hear that they are thinking about it. One thing that I haven&#x27;t heard anything about is the extensibility mechanisms that are exposed. Specifically, custom types, persistence&#xA0;approaches, etc.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Again, a story from class. We are currently building a sample app together, and I get to see just how painful it is to try to build domain driven applications on the naked CLR. A lot of the stuff that makes DDD possible (rich object graphs, for instance) is entirely too hard to do without tool support. The end result is a transaction script pattern, where there is a chain of method calls that ends up with a call to the DB, usually to a stored procedure. I thought about keeping the SQL in the application layer, but to do it correctly, I would need a real data layer, and that basically means that I crack opens Fowler&#x27;s Patterns Of Enterprise Applications and start implementing Unit Of Work and Identity Map, etc. Horrendous amount of work, frankly. Assuming that you have no access to tooling, and you don&#x27;t have the resources to built NHibernate-sque framework, how would you approach building a Domain Driven application on the naked CLR? Is it even possible?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently got this email, and the author has kindly given me permission to post the email and my response to it:  At this moment, I&#xA0;will be&#xA0;suggesting to&#xA0;my project team in my company to use ORM, hopefully to make our software development faster especially on the data layer side. We use LLBLGen (the old one), and we really have plenty of stored procedures which were hard to maintain.  I also noticed about subsonic today. I watched&#xA0;the videos and were impressed about it.  1)&#xA0; However I am not too clear about the difference between subsonic and nhibernate. It looks so alike, furthermore both of them have so much similarities with LINQ. What is your view on this? Most people mentioned that nhibernate was bloated.. something like that which I wasn&#x27;t clear about it.  2)&#xA0;&#xA0;When LINQ release, I should scrap off either subsonic or nhibernate for this platform. As LINQ is built into the language itself, it is easier to extend. I am aware that there is something like LINQ for NHibernate. Are these 2 the same technology or ???  3) Is nhibernate ready to be used in real enterprise commercial projects? Will there be any payment to it? Or it is completely free?  4)&#xA0;Last but not least, I am not too sure whether nhibernate does code generation like subsonic. But I did heard that nhibernate relied on codesmith, which you needed to purchase codesmith. Well, obviously I prefer NHibernate, that has absolutely nothing to do with anything about SubSonic, I am simply strongly biased toward NHibernate. That said, let me try to summarize what I think the difference between the two are. NHibernate and SubSonic takes two different approaches toward OR/M, NHibernate has the &quot;objects is all you see&quot; approach, while SubSonic is much closer to the way that the database view of the world. You still deals with some of the stuff from ADO.Net directly, but SubSonic takes most (all?) of the pain from that. From going over the docs, it looks like SubSonic has a fairly complete support for object view of the world. Both are valid approaches, and choosing between them is a matter of what you are more comfortable with, and what do you want to accomplish. If you are trying to build a Domain Driven application, NHibernate is the preferred approach, if you are building on an existing database, with existing stored procedures, you should probably see if SubSonic would be right for you.  I would probably not choose that, but I am biased, as I said. I should mention that NHibernate is supplying the OR/M bits only, SubSonic seems to do more than that, code generation, integration with EntLib, WebForms controls, etc. Now let me try to answer the questions themselves.  1/ There is a difference between Linq and the OR/M that are built on Linq (Microsoft &amp; Naming again). Linq is a set of extensions to the language, which opens up interesting approaches for set based logic in imperative language. In other words, it is wonderful syntactic sugar, and I am looking forward to be able to making use of that in creative ways. Linq for Sql is an OR/M whose query language is Linq queries, as far as I can see, this is a good approach from Microsoft, but it is limited to SQL Server only, and lacks some of the essentials features that I, as an advance user of OR/M needs. For most basic scenarios, I believe it should suffice. NHibernate bloated... I haven&#x27;t heard this before, and I would be interested to know by what criteria. 2/ No, you certainly should not. As I explained, Linq and the Linq for Sql product are two different things. From the way Microsoft is positioning Linq for Sql, I would assume that it would be harder to extend. Linq for NHibernate is a way to query NHibernate using Linq, that is all. You get the nice Linq syntax and the power from NHibernate. I would assume that SubSonic would have similar features (if it doesn&#x27;t have it already). 3/ NHibernate is more than ready. It is the backbone for quite a lot of enterprise commercial projects right now. It is completely free, and require no payment. Commercial support can be had from JBoss or my company. 4/ NHibernate doesn&#x27;t do code generation, that is outside the scope of the OR/M. There are several code generators that will output NHibernate mapping and classes, including free ones. CodeSmith certainly has some good templates for NHibernate, but it is not the only one by far. At the end, it comes done to evaluating whatever you can be effective with the tool in the approach that you prefer. You mentioned that you are currently suffering from pain as a result of hard to maintain stored procedures. Take NHibernate for a spin on your database, see if you are productive, then take SubSonic and do the same. That are numerous sources of information about both, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem to get started. Either way, have fun, and remember to choose by what will make your life easier, both now and in the long run.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am a bit late with this one, but here is a new version for NHibernate 1.2 GA.&#xA0;This also supports Castle Active Record, hopefully in a version neutral way. You can get it here, or admire the UI here:   As an aside, I am thinking about adding Criteria Query functionality, since this is something that I use a lot. I am not sure yet what form this would take, at any rate it would involve runtime code generation, so that is complex (and sort of fun/pain). I am opened to ideas. Have fun...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Alex* has posted a piece of code that will solve my issue with Window Live Writer and spell checking. The problem is that this is clearly working around a technical limitation in the software, as a non English speaker, I am obviously required to use Windows Live Writer Team Edition, which will (in the next version only, mind you) support English spell checking for non-English speakers. I am expecting the Cease &amp; Desist to come at any moment, and Alex is currently expecting an attack from the Tean Ninja Lawyers teams. Nice hack Alex, now off to prison with you. * Sorry to pick on you, but that was too good an example not to use.</p>
