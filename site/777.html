            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Aaron has a post&#xA0;about some wild ideas about OR/M fetching, specifically, auto-learning fetching strategies. The idea has merit, and the required technicalities are already inside NHibernate, I can imagine a proxy that talks to to fetching strategy to inform it about accessed properties, which would give it the information needed for the next time the same query is made. But, how do you correlate queries? I have &quot;Repository&lt;Salary&gt;.FindAll(Where.Salary.Employee == CurrentEmployee);&quot; in several places, in the &quot;list employee salaries page&quot; and in the &quot;calculate tax&quot; service. Each requires a different fetching strategy. Worse, I have this hiding in a method call GetEmployeeSalaries(Employee), so now we can&#x27;t even use the callsite information to do our smarts. We can try to do something with stack traces, but I am not sure that this is something that you would really want to do, as this has performance implications of its own.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jay Kimble&#xA0;posted in response to Sam Gentile post about Microsoft&#x27;s future direction. The part that I didn&#x27;t like was: Honestly while I understand the whole MVC pattern and why everyone is all gaga... it&#x27;s not always necessary to go to that extreme.&#xA0; My understanding has been that MVC is great for web sites that have high traffic... And short afterward, we have this gem: I could probably give a number of the DailyWTF entries based on examples from this site I had the chance of working in systems of exploding complexity, what I have found is that shortchanging the best practices even in the small has a high cost on many levels, testability, maintainability, complexity, etc. The problem is that you start small, thinking you can just hack it done, but when change is required,&#xA0;which is inevitable, you are in for a world of hurt. This kind of thing leads to awkward technical solutions&#xA0;that doesn&#x27;t solve the root issue, are much more complex than they should, and obfuscate the solution entirely. Here is the secret about these kind of best practices, done right, they are less costly than the just throwing code at the problem. If you are building non-throwaway code, then I would always suggest to use the best practices, even if you start small. Jay&#x27;s point about MVC being applicable only to web sites with high traffic is not correct, MVC is about splitting responsabilities in the application in a consistent manner. It is as application in a toy applications as in a highly scalable ones. There are a set of patterns that you want to use if you are building truly highly scalable applications, but they really make your life harder for smaller scale applications (the vast majority). But, and this is important, in a properly designed application, it is usually not hard to make significant changes to the application as a whole, and add the best practices that fit your specific scenario.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Let me start out by saying that I know of a lot of people that are doing MVC with WebForms, I am doing it myself right now, which put me in the position to talk about the pain that it brings.&#xA0; Let us consider the traditional MVC pattern:          Now, in such a pattern, who is supposed to be in control? To drive the application? If you have guessed that the &quot;Controller&quot; is the one that is supposed to be in control, you got the jackpot, but missed the boat (am I mixing methapors here?) as far as WebForms-based MVC platforms are concerned.    The WebForm model, a PageController with complex life cycle, has a direct affect on the structure of the rest of the application. After trying to get true MVC working on WebForms, I now believe it to be impossible to get it to work in a way that would satisfy me. My view on views is that they are:            Stupid            Presentation logic only            Do not affect the rest of the application    For the purpose of this dicussion, I am going to ignore the differences between MVC, MVP, Passive View, etc. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the view doing data binding, UI logic, etc. The problem is that there are only three models that can be used with WebForms &amp; MVC:            Front Controller that later invokes the Page - Basically, the way that MonoRail integrates the WebForm view engine. The problem with that is that ASPX isn&#x27;t really that smart about stuff, so you end up having to do a lot of stuff in the code behind, which means that you usually need to call the controller for stuff.        This gives you wierd state issues, where the controller method has run, but then it is called again to get more information that the view is needed.        The main issue is with this are stuff like pressing a button, which is very hard to do in a web-nice way with WebForms, neccesiating to catch the event in the view and then call to the controller again. Ugly.        This is probably the best approach, but unless you are doing it with MonoRail, it is also the most expensive one in terms of time and investment. JB has some thoughts about this subject, from using MonoRail &amp; WebForms.        Even when you are using MonoRail, this is awkward.            The Page is calling the Controller&#x27;s methods. This is what I am using currently, but I find that this introduce the same state based issues that I am trying to avoid (orderring of method calls, etc) and it still gives too much responsability to the view.        It basically make the view a semi controller, because it is what drives the controller. The most painful parts are stuf like GetPolicies(), GetUsers(), etc, which are called directly on the controller by the view to get the data it needs.        I could do it the other way around, FillData(IView), I suppose, but that gives me awkward model for the state changes that is required in most complex screens. Basically, the FillData() would need to get the purpose for this, so I would have FillDataForDefaultCustomer, FillDataForChangedCustomer, etc.        Another issue is that my controllers are inherintly multi-views capable. That is mostly because of the architecture of WebForms &amp; Atlas, this requires me to put some of the stuff that should respond to an Ajax call in a web service or HttpHandler. Those are all going to the same controller (same use case), but there have very different needs.            Registering to the view events in the controller. This seems to be a fairly favoraite pattern for MVP in ASP.Net. I have issues with that because we now has strong ties from the view&#x27;s behavior to the controller behavior. I think that methods like: &quot;void OnLoad(object sender, EventArgs e)&quot; are code smell, and they don&#x27;t give me much separation from the view. In fact, they are Code Behind done right, without dealing with the UI at all.    To be clear, all three methods give me a few things very important that it is very hard to get from naked WebForms, namely: Separation of Concerns &amp; Testability.    The most problamatic&#xA0;part in this is that it is very hard to get view-ignorance capabilities using the WebForm approach, it is much harder than it should, and the page lifecycle issue is paramount in both view and controller.    My current approach in WebForms MVC is the second approach, but it is very easy to add additonal concerns to the view without noticing, and my controllers looks more like a service class than a true controller.    As you can guess from the title, I don&#x27;t think that this is somethig that can be solved when using the WebForms framework. The view is so centric to the very idea of WebForms that it is impossible to work without its influence.    I am probably going to do another screen cast on this, but at this point I am giving up. I am fed up with approximations. If you want to do MVC in ASP.Net, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the real thing with WebForms.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am one of those fellows that tend to run on the trunk. What does it mean?&#xA0; It means that I am using the latest version of the source for my projects. So, I am on the trunk for Boo, NHibernate and Castle (which can be tricky, since Castle isn&#x27;t on NHibernate trunk). This has significant advantages for an active OSS project, NHibernate&#x27;s trunk has the multi criteria support, MonoRail&#x27;s trunk has the testing support, and since stuff is moving in response to the needs of the users, it is evolving fast. Sean Chambers was impressed by how fast this can happen in many cases. (In others, it is a slower process, but still mostly visible.) There are some disadvantages, people (recently it was mostly me, sadly) can break the trunk, or commit functionality that breaks your code. In general, I have not found this to be the case for the projects that I am working on. A lot of the committers are running on the trunk as well, and there is a big pressure to make sure that the trunk is stable (ready to ship) because I, at least, do ship from it. The&#xA0;major disadvantage here, from my point of view,&#xA0;is using a piece of code that is still under development or review. The recent case was Criteria cloning in NHibernate, which has gone through some modifications to get to its current form. Personally, I don&#x27;t find it onerous to do so, and those are usually rare. The big advantage is that you get continiously improvements. I does reviews of the changes every now again (now limited to scanning the logs and looking at what has changed) and it keep amaze me how much good stuff is going in there.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In an eerily similar timing, Fowler manages to hit a lot of the stuff that I am feeling, and he is doing it much better than I could. This paragraph has certainly hit a note:  The attitude to open-source is a large part of this problem. When Java appeared there were yawning gaps in its portfolio, and worse some dreadful standard tools in its API (visions of Entity Beans spring to mind). Those gaps and bad ideas were fixed by the open-source community. Ant gave us a build tool, EJB was displaced by Spring and Hibernate. .NET has also got its gaps, and again the open source community has stepped up to fill them. Yet Microsoft refuses to collaborate with these efforts, even seems to go out of its way to undermine them. I was particularly sickened by Microsoft&#x27;s reaction to NUnit - an excellent XUnit testing tool, elements of whose design were lauded by Anders Hejlsberg at OOPSLA. Microsoft ended not just bringing out a competitive library, but deliberately making it incompatible. That&#x27;s not the kind of reaction that encourages people to invest their time in the platform. That is one of the more frustratinng points in working in the Microsoft space, Microsoft is actively competing against its own community, and that diminishes the entire community (and Microsoft as well).</p>
