        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For a while, I was absolutely against this, in fact, I refused to implement this several times when asked, because it is complicate to do and indicate design problems in your domain model. During a course today, I found out that I might want to refuse, but the feature is actually in the product for the last two&#x2B; years, we just didn&#x2019;t know about this. But what are tertiary includes in the first place? Let us imagine that we have something like this:  Now, I want to load an order, but also show its Customer and Products. Those are secondary includes, and are very easy to do with RavenDB: var orders = session.Query&lt;Order&gt;()                  .Include(&quot;Customer&quot;)&#xA;                  .Include(&quot;Lines,Product&quot;)&#xA;                  .ToList();&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;There is also a strongly typed option for this, of course. &#xA;What this does is instruct RavenDB to load into the session the Customer and the associated Products into the session, so when you do something like this:&#xA;var cust = session.Load&lt;Customer&gt;(order.Customer);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The value will be loaded from the session cache, without going to the sever. As I said, this is a feature that we have had for quite a while, and it is a really nice one, because it drastically reduce the number of queries that you have to make.&#xA;The problem is that some people want to take it one step further, they want to be able to search on an Order, but also load the Location of a Product. I don&#x2019;t really like this, and as I said, when asked for this feature, I consistently said that it isn&#x2019;t there because it represent a remnant of relational thinking in your design.&#xA;But as it turned out, we do support this, although quite by accident.&#xA;The reason is quite simple, we evaluate Includes only after we evaluate the TranformResults function. Which means that the TranformResults function gets to choose whatever you want to include. Here is how it works:&#xA;TranformResults  = (database, results) =&gt;&#xA;   from result in results&#xA;   select new &#xA;   {&#xA;     Order = result,&#xA;     Locations = result.SelectMany(x=&gt;x.Lines).Select(x=&gt;database.Load&lt;Product&gt;(x.Product).Location)&#xA;   }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And then, you can just ask to Include(&#x201C;Locations&#x201D;), and you are pretty much set.&#xA;Except, that this is a really awkward thing to do, and I don&#x2019;t really like it at all.&#xA;Sure, I don&#x2019;t like this feature, but people will use it, and if it already there, we might as well make it elegant. Therefor, we now have the option of doing:&#xA;TranformResults  = (database, results) =&gt;&#xA;   from result in results&#xA;   let _ = database.Include(result.SelectMany(x=&gt;x.Lines).Select(x=&gt;x.Product))&#xA;   select result;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I think you&#x2019;ll agree that this is much nicer all around, this tells the server to include the data, without us needing to explicitly ask this from the client.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Having just finished giving three courses (2 on RavenDB and 1 on NHibernate), you might want to say that I have a lot of data stuff on my mind. Teaching is always a pleasure to me, and one of the major reasons for that is that I get to actually learn a lot whenever I teach. In this case, in all three courses, we run into an issue with modeling associations. For the sake of the example, let us talk about employees and paychecks. You can see the model below:  Do you note the blue lines? Those represent Employee reference, but while they are both referencing the same employee, they are actually quite different associations. The Manager association is a Current Association. It is just a pointer to the managing employee. What does this means? Let us say that the manager of a certain employee changed her name. In that scenario, when we look at the current employee record, we should see the updated employee manager name. In this case, we are always interested in the current status. On the other hand when looking at the paycheck PaidTo reference to an employee, we have something all together different. We have a reference no to the current employee record, but to the employee record as it was at a certain point in time. If the employee in question change his name, that paycheck was issued to Mr. Version One, not to Mr. Version Two, even though the name has been changed. when dealing with associations, it is important to distinguish between the two options, as each require different way of working with the association.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In 99.9% of the cases, if you see this, it is a mistake:  But I recently came into a place where this is actually a viable solution to a problem. The issue occurs deep inside RavenDB. And it boils down to a managed application not really having any way of actually assessing how much memory it is using.  What I would really like to be able to do is to specify a heap (using HeapCreate) and then say: &#x201C;The following objects should be created on this heap&#x201D;, which would allow to me to control exactly how much memory I am using for a particular task. In practice, that isn&#x2019;t really possible (if you know how, please let me know). What we do instead is to use as much memory as we can, based on the workload that we have. At certain point, we may hit an Out of Memory condition, which we take to mean, not that there is no more memory, but the system&#x2019;s way of telling us to calm down. By the time we reached the exception handler, we already lost all of the current workload, that means that now there is a LOT of garbage around for the GC. Before, when it tried to cleanup, we were actually holding to a lot of that memory, but not anymore. Once an OOME happened, we can adjust our own behavior, to know that we are consuming too much memory and should be more conservative about our operations. We basically reset the clock back and become twice as conservative about using more memory. And if we get another OOME? We become twice as conservative again , and so on. Eventually, even under high workloads and small amount of memory, we complete the task, and we can be sure that we make effective use of the system&#x2019;s resources available to us.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Demand for RavenDB training has been going up, and we are actually running around (pretty much world wide) trying to catch up. After completing a course in Stockholm a couple of weeks ago, we have a new course in Stockholm in October, which you can register to using the following link. I&#x2019;ll also be doing a course in Munich, Germany, early next month. You can register to that here. And, of course, we have the already scheduled courses, I mean, just take a look:  RavenDB 2 day workshop with Oren Eini - Munich, Germany - Tuesday, 03 July 2012 Sharding &amp; Scaling with RavenDB - Berlin, Germany - Wednesday, 04 July 2012 RavenDB 2 day workshop in the Hibernating Rhinos&#x27; offices - Hadera, Israel - Wednesday, 11 July 2012 RavenDB 2 day workshop with Itamar Syn-Hershko - New York, USA - Tuesday, 21 August 2012 RavenDB at Philly.NET user group - Malvern, PA, USA - Monday, 27 August 2012 RavenDB Meetup in Washington DC - Washington DC, USA - Tuesday, 28 August 2012 RavenDB 1-day bootcamp with Itamar Syn-Hershko - Chicago, IL, USA - Thursday, 30 August 2012 RavenDB 2-day workshop - Austin, TX - Wednesday, 05 September 2012 RavenDB 2 day workshop with Itamar Syn-Hershko - London, UK - Wednesday, 12 September 2012 RavenDB 2 day workshop with Oren Eini - Stockholm, Sweden - Thursday, 04 October 2012 And on top of that, we have been doing some really cool stuff that I can&#x2019;t hardly wait to talk about this, as part of our upcoming 1.2 release for RavenDB.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a reply to a post by Frans Bouma, in which he asks for:  &#x2026;loud vendors should offer simply one VM to me. On that VM I run the websites, store my DB and my files. As it&#x27;s a virtual machine, how this machine is actually ran on physical hardware (e.g. partitioned), I don&#x27;t care, as that&#x27;s the problem for the cloud vendor to solve. If I need more resources, e.g. I have more traffic to my server, way more visitors per day, the VM stretches, like I bought a bigger box. This frees me from the problem which comes with multiple VMs: I don&#x27;t have any refactoring to do at all: I can simply build my website as if it runs on my local hardware server, upload it to the VM offered by the cloud vendor, install it on the VM and I&#x27;m done. Um&#x2026; no.  Go ahead and read the whole post, it is interesting. But the underlying premise that is rely on is flawed. It is like starting out with assuming that since TCP/IP contains no built in prohibition to send data faster than light, the cloud providers can and should create networks that can send data faster than light. After all, I can show a clear business case for the reduced ping time, and that is certainly something that can be abstracted from my application. What aren&#x2019;t those bozos doing that? Well, the answer to that is that it just ain&#x2019;t possible. There are several minor problems along the way. The CAP theorem, to start with, but even if we ignore that aspect of the problem, there are also the fallacies of distributed computing. According to Frans&#x2019; premise, we can have a single VM that can scale up to as many machines as is needed, without any change required to the system. Let us start with Frans&#x2019; answer to the actual scope of the problem:  But what about memory replication and other problems? This environment isn&#x27;t simple, at least not for the cloud vendor. But it is simple for the customer who wants to run his sites in that cloud: no work needed. No refactoring needed of existing code. Upload it, run it. Um.. no.  Let us take a look at a few pieces of code, and see what is going to happen to then in Frans&#x2019; cloud environment. For example, let us take a look at this: var tax = 0;&#xA;foreach(var item in order.Items)&#xA;{&#xA;  tax &#x2B;= item.CalculateTax();   &#xA;}&#xA;order.Tax = tax;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Problem, because of the elasticity of the VM, we actually spread things around so each of the items in the order collection is located in another physical machine. This is, of course, completely transparent to the code. But that means that each loop iteration is actually doing a network call behind the scene.&#xA;OR/M users are familiar with this as the SELECT N&#x2B;1 problem, but in this case, you have a potential problem on every memory access. Network attached memory isn&#x2019;t new, you can read about it in OS books and it is a nice theoretical idea, but it is just isn&#x2019;t going to work, because you actually care about the speed of accessing the data.&#xA;In fact, we have many algorithms that were changed specifically to be able to take advantage of cache lines, L1 &amp; L2 cache, etc. Because that has a major increase in the system performance, and that is only on a single machine. Trying to imagine a transparent network memory is futile, you actually care about memory access speed, a lot.&#xA;But let us talk about another aspect, I want to make have an always incrementing order id number. So I do:&#xA;&#xA;Interlocked.Increment(ref lastOrderId);&#xA;All well and good when running on a single machine, but how should the VM make it work when running on multiple machines? &#xA;And remember, this call actually translate to a purpose built assembly instruction (XADD or one of its friends). In this case, you need to do this across the network, and touch as many machines as your system currently runs on.&#xA;But the whole point here is to allow us to rapidly generate a new number. This has now turned into a total mess in terms of performance.&#xA;What about parallel computing, for that matter?&#xA;var results = new Result[items.Length];&#xA;Parallel.For(items, (item, i) =&gt; &#xA;{&#xA;    results[i] = item.Calculate();&#xA;});&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I have many items, and I want to be able to compute the result in parallel, so I run this fairly standard code. But we are actually going to execute this on multiple threads, so this get scheduled on several different machines. But now you have to copy the results buffer to all of those machines, as well as any related state that they have, then copy it back out when it is done, then somehow merge the different changes made by different systems into a coherent whole.&#xA;Good luck with that.&#xA;I could go on, but I think that you get the point by now.&#xA;And we haven&#x2019;t talked about the error condition yet. What happen if my system is running on 3 machines, and one of them goes down (power outage, hardware failure, etc)? 3rd of my memory, ongoing work and a lot of stuff just got lost. For that matter, I might have (actually, probably have) dangling references to memory that used to be on the failed machines, so the other two systems are likely to hit this inaccessible memory and fail themselves.&#xA;So.. no, this idea is a pipe dream, it isn&#x2019;t going to work, not because of some evil plot by dastardly folks conspiring to make your life harder, but for the simple reason that it is easier to fly by flapping your arms.</p>
