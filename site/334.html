            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB replication had a load balancing mode for quite some time, using round robin balancing between all the nodes. With RavenDB 3.5, we have added support for Service Level Agreements with the load balancing. You can configure it like so:  What this does is instruct the client to define a policy, and if a server starts responding too slowly for the provided policy, we are going to reduce the number of requests that we are going to send its way. For example, let us say that we use the default 100ms per request, with three nodes.  We start with all read requests being spread across all three servers. All of them respond pretty much the same, so we have no reason to change the load allocation. Now, and administrator is running a full backup on one of the nodes, which can consume quite a lot of I/O, so requests from this node suffer and become slower. The moment that those requests start going over the 100ms limit, RavenDB wakes up, and say: &quot;It isn&#x27;t nice to violate the SLA, maybe I won&#x27;t visit as often&quot;, and start changing the request allocation away from this server. Note that we aren&#x27;t going to stop talking to it directly, the RavenDB client will just fewer requests its way, until either the server is able to keep up with the load in the given SLA. As long as it can&#x27;t keep up with the SLA, we will further reduce the number of requests. This whole approach uses decaying semantics, so new responses are more important than old responses, which means that as soon as the backup operation completes and we have free I/O, RavenDB will detect that and ramp up the number of requests until we are balanced again. We actually have two modes here. One of them (shown above) talks only to the primary, and if the SLA is violated, it will then start directing queries to other servers. The second mode is to spread the load along all servers, and only use the servers that are under the provided SLA. I think that the second mode is more interesting, but the first one is easier to reason about, because it is a simple overflow model. As a reminder, we have the RavenDB Conference in Texas in a few months, which would be an excellent opportunity to see RavenDB 3.5 in all its glory.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We have got pretty much everything working, and all tests are passing on Windows. We&#x2019;ll test it tomorrow on Linux, but it is looking good. I&#x2019;m really excited about this. To start with, just moving to RC2 looks like it dropped about 20% of our test suite runtime. But it also removed a blocking issue that prevented us from getting a core feature up and running (dynamic code generation, which is required for user defined indexes). Now we can get started on that .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Map/Reduce is a core part of RavenDB, one of the earliest features that we implemented and something that we have worked to improve many times. You can read my original blog post about them. In the current codebase, Map/Reduce is also one of the scariest pieces of code, and one of the most fragile. The good thing is that we have a really high number of tests around it. The sad thing is that it takes a long time to make any modification there to stick without breaking something else. It is a complex topic from the get go, and having a performant version of that was not trivial, so put all together, this is one of the more complex pieces of code in RavenDB. I&#x2019;m not going to go into the details on how this works now, it is that complex. That complexity really bugged me. This is an area of the code that only a few of us had approached, and usually with various levels of dread. We spent so much time simplifying things in RavenDB 4.0 that I couldn&#x2019;t really abide the concept of having to bring this complexity over and having to live with it. But we couldn&#x2019;t find a better way to do it.  Until I realized that I was thinking about this in totally the wrong level. The way to handle that was to reduce the level of abstraction down, way down. Again, being able to control the storage at a very low level helps a lot. I have talked before about B&#x2B;Trees, and this time, we are going to use their structure directly. Here is how it works. Let us assume that we have the following map/reduce index: &#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Now, for the actual implementation. We first run the map function over a set of orders, giving us the mapped results, which we&#x2019;ll store in a B&#x2B;Tree.&#xA0; A B&#x2B;Tree is a key/value structure, and previously we used composite keys using the reduced key, the document key, and a whole bunch of other stuff. That led to a whole lot of complications. Now, we are going to have a separate key per reduce key. Confusing? Lets see if I can explain. Each reduce key (a reduce key is the thing that you group by, in this case, that is the product id) is going to have its own dedicated tree. And the content of that tree is going to be the document id as the key to the tree, and the mapped result for that particular reduce key as the value. So far, that isn&#x2019;t really impressive. We changed things around, instead of having a single tree for all mapped results, we are going to have a tree per reduce key. But here is where it gets interesting. B&#x2B;Tree are&#x2026; well, trees. That means that they are hierarchical in nature. What we did was ask the tree to let us know about all the changed pages. Consider the image below, which shows the status of the database after indexing a few orders, which have line items for products/17 and products/10.   We are now going to update orders/2. So the next thing that we need to do, is to run the map over the updated order, giving us new entries for products/17 and products/10. Each of them in a different tree. Because we can ask the tree what pages have changed, we can now do the following:  For each changed page:  calculate the new value of the page. mark the parent page as changed Repeat until there are no changed pages. Let us see this in detail, in Page 14, which is the (small) tree for products/10, we don&#x2019;t really have much to do. We just need to run the reduce over all the entries in the page, and we have the final result. Things are more interesting with products/17.  Here, we updated Page 31 during the map process. When we get to the reduce, we discover that, and that means that we need to re-reduce Page 31. But that isn&#x2019;t the end. Now we need to also update things upward. In our case, we need to update Page 13. You might have noticed the list on the side, there is the computed reduce value per each page there. And when we are done updating Page 31, we go to its parent, Page 13. We get the computed values for pages 31,44, 32 and reduce those, giving us the final value for Page 13. In which point, we go up yet again, and reduce Page 13 and Page 33 together, resulting in the final value. All in all, this is pretty simple to explain, was very easy to implement and is going to handle the complexities of map/reduce in dramatically better fashion.  In the example above, I&#x2019;m showing it working with very few entries per page. In practice, we are usually talking about roughly 200 entries per page, so a reduce key has more than 200 entries, we start going with the multiple steps. Our go-to example for map reduce was the US census. 310 million people, more or less, and we want to build a count of how many people per state. That gives us California, with roughly 40 million people in it. Adding a new person to California using this system will result in a B&#x2B;Tree that have a depth of 5, and re-reducing after an update will take less than a thousand operations to re-compute it. And that is for an update / delete operation. If we have a new value, we can skip the whole thing, and re-update the map/reduce in about 6 operations. And the entire codebase is easy to read, and we expect it to be much faster as well.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB 3.5 has been in development for over two years, and we finally get to see it taking its first steps out the gate. You can read about all the goodies in this blog post series, and we have more features being unveiled each day, until the RavenDB Conference next week. You can get build 35100 right now, and start playing with the bits.  What does this mean? Beta means just that, the software is pretty much ready, we have all the features we want, and while there are still a bunch of pending tasks (mostly in the UI and outer layers), the software is ready for actual use.  We expect the beta period to last about six to eight weeks, during which we&#x2019;ll finish the remaining work and run it though the usual wringer (longevity, performance, stabilization, etc) before going with RC and finally RTM. We are currently expecting RTM release in July/August time frame.  I&#x2019;ll be talking about this release a lot in the RavenDB Conference.  We&#x2019;ll be updating the website and the documentation for the next few weeks, as part of the release cycle, but I wanted to get the bits into your hands as soon as possible.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The indexing process in RavenDB is not trivial, it is composed of many small steps that need to happen and coordinate with one another to reach the end goal.  A lot of the complexity involved is related to concurrent usage, parallelization of I/O and computation and a whole bunch of other stuff like that. In RavenDB 3.0 we added support for visualizing all of that, so you can see what is going on, and can tell what is taking so long. With RavenDB 3.5, we extended that from just looking at the indexing documents to looking into the other parts of the indexing process.  In this image, you can see the green rectangles representing prefetching cycles of documents from the disk, happening alongside indexing cycles (representing as the color rectangles, with visible concurrent work and separate stages. The good thing about this is that it make it easy to see whatever there is any waste in the indexing process, if there is a gap, we can see it and investigate why that happens. Another change we made was automatic detection of corrupted Lucene indexes (typical case, if you run out of disk space, it is possible that the Lucene index will be corrupted, and after disk space is restored, it is often not recoverable by Lucene), so we now can automatically detect that scenario and apply the right action (trying to recover from a previous instance, or resetting the index). As a reminder, we have the RavenDB Conference in Texas in a few months, which would be an excellent opportunity to see RavenDB 3.5 in all its glory.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my last post on the topic, I discussed physically separating documents of different collections. This post is about the same concept, but applied at a much higher level. In RavenDB, along with the actual indexing data, we also need to keep track of quite a few details. What did we last index, what is our current state, any errors that happened, keep track of referenced documents, etc. For map/reduce indexes, we have quite a bit more data that we need to work with, all the intermediate results of the map/reduce process, along with bookkeeping information about how to efficiently reduce additional values, etc. All of that information is stored in the same set of files as the documents themselves. As far as the user is concerned, this is mostly relevant when we need to delete an index. Because on large databases the deletion of a big index can take a while, this was an operational issue. In RavenDB 3.0 we changed things so index deletion would be async, which improved matters significantly. But on large databases with many indexes, that still got us into problems. Because all the indexes were using the same underlying storage, that meant that the number of values that we had to track was high. And it was proportional to the number of indexes and the amount of documents they indexed. That means that in a particular database with a hundred million documents, and three map/reduce indexes, we had to keep track of over half a billion entries. B&#x2B;Trees are really amazing creatures, but one of their downsides is that once they get to a certain size, they slow down as the cost of traversing the tree become very high. In relational terms, we put all the indexing data into a single table, and had a IndexId column to distinguish between the different records. And once the table got big enough, we had issues. One of the design decisions we made in the build up to RavenDB 4.0 was to remove multi threaded behavior inside Voron, so that led to an interesting problem with having everything in the same Voron storage. We wouldn&#x2019;t be able to index and accept new documents at the same time (I&#x2019;ll have another post about this design decision).  The single threaded nature and the problems with index deletion has led us toward an interesting decision. A RavenDB database isn&#x2019;t actually composed from a single Voron storage. It is composed of multiple of those, each of them operating independently of one another.  The first one, obviously, is for the documents. But each of the indexes now have its own Voron storage. That means that they are totally independent from one another, which leads to a few interesting implications:  Deleting an index is as simple as shutting down the indexing for this index and then deleting the Voron directory from the file system. Each index has its own independent data structures, so having multiple big indexes isn&#x2019;t going to cause us to pay the price of all of them together. Because each index has a dedicated thread, we aren&#x2019;t going to see any complex coordination between multiple actors needing to use the same Voron storage. This is important, because in RavenDB 4.0, we are also storing the actual Lucene index inside the Voron storage, so the amount of work that we now require it to deal with is much higher. By splitting it along each index line, we have saved ourselves a whole bunch of headache on how to manage them properly. As a reminder, we have the RavenDB Conference in Texas shortly, which would be an excellent opportunity to discuss RavenDB 4.0 and see what we already have done.</p>
