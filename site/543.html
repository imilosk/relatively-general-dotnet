        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The absolutely hardest thing in most projects is to (and I am going to be blunt), to get the customer to shut up and let the team start working. I have been in several projects where the actual move from blah blah talking to actual doing was a painful and drawn out process. In one particular example, I was brought on as a team lead for a team that had 4 months to produce a system. I was stunned to discover that the last two years were spent in meetings on top of meetings on top of meetings. At some point I flat out abandoned the spec, forced got management approval to talk directly with the users and started supplying them what they wanted. I still consider this to be a horrible project, but at least we shipped. I found several approach that can facilitate the move from talking to doing. The first one, and the one that I prefer, is to actually start building the software. Now, I don&#x27;t refer to building the actual production software, but to building a spike of how things are supposed to work. Show it in the next meeting, and I can almost guarantee that the discussion is going to shift radically. When you put something in front of people, especially since in spike mode you can get things done really fact (no code quality, no error handling, pure nasty coding). In several past projects, I have used this approach to leap over the &quot;let us just get started&quot; hurdle. The main issue is that the business would like to really understand what they want to do, before asking the developers to do so. But since many things are fixed already, that is, the general concepts are already known, and the devil is in the details, we can start painting the outline of the system in broad strokes and fine tune it later. The idea is to push the business into that mode. And spikes get us there quickly. Another method that I have started to use lately (which is even easier than spikes) is the use of UI mock up. Using a tool like Balsamiq Mockups, this is ridiculously easy. It also serve as a great spur to actually starting to do things. Instead of getting mired in details, I can get a pretty good picture of a vertical slice of the application, and go away and actually implement that. Here is a mock up for the landing page for the NHibernate Profiler web site:   You can see the real thing here. As you can see, it isn&#x27;t the same at all, but I think that we can all agree that there are marked similarities between them. This mock up took about 3 minutes to build, and we did that while on the phone and with screen sharing. But it meant that we talked about something concrete.  When you are starting to talk in concrete terms, you have already much closer to getting starting doing something real. Those are just a few example of initiating actions, actions that can get you to move from the talk talk talk phase into the get things done phase. It is important to make this move as soon as possible, for several reasons. Not least of them is that we value working software over comprehensive documentation and lengthy discourse.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Another implication of not using explicit transactions with NHibernate is related ot the use of the second level cache.  NHibernate goes to great lengths in order to ensure that the 2nd level cache shows a consistent view of the database. In order to do that it is defering all 2nd level cache updates to the transaction commit. In that way, we can be sure that the data in the 2nd level cache is the one committed to the database.  Forgoing the use of explicit transactions has the effect of nulling the 2nd level cache. Here is an example that would make this clear:  using(var session = sessionFactory.OpenSession()) &#xA;{ &#xA;&#x9;var post = session.Get&lt;Post&gt;(1);&#xA;&#x9;// do something with post&#xA;} &#xA;Even if the 2nd level cache is enabled for Post, it is still not going to be cached in the 2nd level cache. The reason is that until we commit a transaction, NHibernate will not update the cache with the values for the loaded entities. &#xA;This code, however, does make use of the 2nd level cache:&#xA;using(var session = sessionFactory.OpenSession()) &#xA;using(var tx = session.BeginTransaction()) &#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;var post = session.Get&lt;Post&gt;(1);&#xA;&#x9;// do something with post&#xA;&#x9;tx.Commit();&#xA;}</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, I said it is not there yet, but I got annoyed by the lack of this feature, and I really had to make this work. That one was a pretty tough one. It required me to make some minor modifications to NHiberante, as a result, this feature works with NHbierante r3976 or up only. What this means is that if you want to use this feature, you have to get it from the trunk. This is the only feature in NH Prof that requires the trunk. In this feature, we can see that we detect a cached query, and are able to display it properly.:   I am not sure how I should treat this for the purpose of analysis. Should this be grouped with the actual query? Should this be a separate entry? Anyway, just for kicks, here is the test for the feature: [TestFixture]&#xA;public class CachingTestFixture : IntegrationTestBase&#xA;{&#xA;    [Test]&#xA;    public void CanDetectCachedQueries()&#xA;    {&#xA;        ExecuteScenarioInDifferentAppDomain&lt;UsingCacheQueries&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;    &#x9;var array = observer.Model.Sessions[2].Statements.OfType&lt;StatementModel&gt;()&#xA;    &#x9;&#x9;.ToArray();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Assert.AreEqual(@&quot;Cached query: &#xA;SELECT this_.Id             as Id7_0_,&#xA;   this_.Title          as Title7_0_,&#xA;   this_.Subtitle       as Subtitle7_0_,&#xA;   this_.AllowsComments as AllowsCo4_7_0_,&#xA;   this_.CreatedAt      as CreatedAt7_0_&#xA;FROM   Blogs this_&#xA;WHERE  this_.Title = &#x27;The lazy blog&#x27; /* @p0 */&#xA;   and this_.Id = 1 /* @p1 */&#xA;&quot;, array[0].Text);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Assert.AreEqual(@&quot;Cached query: &#xA;select blog0_.Id             as Id7_,&#xA;   blog0_.Title          as Title7_,&#xA;   blog0_.Subtitle       as Subtitle7_,&#xA;   blog0_.AllowsComments as AllowsCo4_7_,&#xA;   blog0_.CreatedAt      as CreatedAt7_&#xA;from   Blogs blog0_&#xA;where  ( blog0_.Title = &#x27;The lazy blog&#x27; /* @p0 */ )&#xA;   and ( blog0_.Id = 1 /* @p1 */ )&#xA;&quot;, array[2].Text);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;As an aside, do you think that posting the tests is good? Should I just do the screen shots?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I don&#x27;t do this often, but this is an exception. My apologies to the people who just want to read about tech, I&#x27;ll soon resume the regular topics.&#xA; &#xA;Oh, and just to clear the records, I served for 4 years in the IDF, and I am still a reservist. I haven&#x27;t been activated, and this post contain my own thoughts about the current situation. I assume that this post is going to be a hot topic. I am going to keep comments open until someone invoke Godwin&#x27;s law, at which point the discuss will end.&#xA;&#xA;There is a term that was a big buzzword several years ago (yes, even outside the tech world there are buzzwords). It is called low intensity conflict. Low intensity conflict is also sometimes called 4th generate warfare. And yes, I am probably making some military history buffs cringe in pain, deal with it.&#xA;It describe a situation in which regular army forces find it difficult to utilize their forces due to non military concerns. In many cases, it is political, media or humanitarian concerns that limit the ability to apply force. A common scenario is shooting at someone from a crowd. The fact that the shooter is in a crowd make the utilization of fire arms against the shooter a problem, because it is likely that other people, presumably innocent, are going to get hurt.&#xA;Israel has quite a history with such conflicts, I am sadden to say.&#xA;Low intensity conflicts are a good way to neutralize the ability of an army to respond appropriately. I think that the best way of explaining the problem in low intensity conflict is with this (extremely famous) picture.&#xA; &#xA;I don&#x27;t think that we need to go into the actual historical background of this picture, it doesn&#x27;t really matter for the discussion at hand.&#xA;This is a very powerful picture, and it capture the sense of disparity in forces that exists.&#xA;What is doesn&#x27;t capture is that a tank vs. kid is not what is going on. The tank cannot realistically do anything to this kid. Any response at all is unthinkable. As a result, we have a situation in which the kid may act with imputiny.&#xA;Now take this picture and zoom it out. Let us see what we have in southern Israel and Gaza at the last three years.&#xA;We have a densely populated area which contains about 1.4 million people. The vast majority of them, I want to remind you, are people who want to live their lives just like anyone else. They bloody well deserve to live their live in peace, freedom and prosperity.&#xA;In 2006, in democratic elections, Hamas has won the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. That caused quite a problem for a lot of people, since Hamas is a terrorist organization, and is recognized as such by the EU, US and the rest of the gang. In case you are not aware of this, let me give some of the highlights from the Hamas&#x27; charter.&#xA;&#xA;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.&#xA;&#xA;And how do they intend to &quot;obliterate Israel&quot; ? &#xA;&#xA;There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.&#xA;&#xA;Notice the part about all talk being a waste of time. We can move on to the next bit of prose. Article 7 of the Hamas Covenant states the following:  &#xA;&#xA;The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (the Cedar tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.&#xA;&#xA;As I said, following a democratic elections in which the Hamas won, the world had a problem. &#xA;Several months before that, Israel has unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza, moving all forces and all citizens out of Gaza. The people of Gaza had the chance they wanted, to manage their own lives. This was a highly contentious act in Israel, those who spoke against it warned that disengaging from Gaza will bring disaster, that the terrorist organizations inside will seize the chance to arm themselves and attack Israel. Those who spoke for it said that this way Israel could give the people of Gaza the freedom that they wanted, and the chance to build a place of their own. &#xA;It didn&#x27;t quite work that way, I am afraid. As I mentioned, Hamas took over the PNA, and the situation, from the point of view of Israel, has gotten worse. Let me give you some idea about the numbers. &#xA;In 2006, 1121 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel.  &#xA;In 2007, 2313 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel. &#xA;in 2008, 1713 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel. &#xA;From 2003 - 2008, 8827 rockets and mortars were fired at Israel. &#xA;On Jun 17th, 2008, there was an informal truce between Hamas and Israel, lasting until Dec 23th, 2008. During this period there were several violations of the truce on both sides, for reasons that don&#x27;t really matter in the grand scheme of things.  &#xA;On Dec 24th, 2008, 70 rockets were launched against Israel. And in the previous weeks regular barrages of rockets were fired on the southern part of Israel. &#xA;Moving on to another topic all together.&#xA0; Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations states: &#xA;&#xA;Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations&#xA;&#xA;This is also called the Principle of Self Defense. This principle is recognized in just about any legal system. &#xA;Going back a week and a half ago. They are shooting at us. They are explicitly targeting civilian targets. &#xA;This is were low intensity conflict come into play. The usual, ineffective, response from Israel would have been within the boundaries of low intensity conflict. A raid, an air attack against rocket teams, something in this order. &#xA;Hamas was perfectly willing to continue playing by those rules. After all, it is to their advantage to keep the conflict in low intensity. &#xA;This time, however, Israel didn&#x27;t respond in the usual ineffective manner. Instead, Israel has started a full scale operation with a single goal. To stop the bombardment on the citizens of Israel. &#xA;There is a lot of cry from people saying that there is no possibility of this being a moral action, and trying to point at the numbers of dead &amp; wounded on both sides as proof of that. &#xA;There are a lot more dead and wounded in Gaza than in Israel.  &#xA;The problem, however, is that morality isn&#x27;t math. You don&#x27;t get to play around with numbers and come up with an answer. &#xA;The situation is quite simple. Hamas had been firing rockets on Israel for years. A truce attempt has failed. Hamas has not only continue to fire rockets on Israel, but has stepped up the number and the range. Hundreds of thousands of the citizens of Israel are at risk.&#xA0; Israel has chosen to act to defend its citizens.  &#xA;I am sadden by the loss of civilian life in Gaza, but my people&#x27;s safety is my main concern. &#xA;Any situation in which rockets are fired on Israel is not acceptable. Any attempt to equate dead count is not acceptable, because it in there is the hidden assumption that Israel should let its own people die before it is allowed to act. &#xA;There is a lot of history and motivation behind all the actions that are going on here. There have been books written about it, and I can&#x27;t do it justice even if I tried. But the plain facts are quite simple. &#xA;Hamas is shooting at the people of Israel. Israel is acting to stop this shooting.  &#xA;I can already predict people trying to bring justifications for why Hamas is shooting at Israel. There can be no reason, to put it plainly. I do not accept any reason that justify shooting at my people.  &#xA;The current situation could have been avoided quite easily. All Hamas had to do was not to shoot at Israel, and talk. There are channels of communications and there are things to talk about. Hamas has followed its charter, of terror and destruction, and fired at Israel. &#xA;Now Israel is acting to stop this from happening again. &#xA;If you want to dispute Israel&#x27;s current actions. You have to start from Dec 24th, with Hamas shooting at Israel, and any act that you make must end with no rockets fired at Israel. &#xA;I intentionally limit the discussion, because attempts to bring history or justifications to the mix are not really relevant. This is the situation that we have to deal with. &#xA;Israel cannot accept its citizens being fired upon, full stop.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One word of warning first, this feature is currently for entities only, NH Prof cannot (currently) inspect cached queries. That said, I am working on it, but this is something that is going to require some changes to NHibernate, so it is a feature that will be available on NHibernate 2.1 only. That said, you can see the profiling result of this piece of code: public class LoadEntityByIdFromSecondLevelCache : IScenario&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public void Execute(ISessionFactory factory)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;int id;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;using (ISession s = factory.OpenSession())&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;using(ITransaction tx = s.BeginTransaction())&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;id = s.CreateCriteria(typeof(Blog))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;.SetMaxResults(1)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;.UniqueResult&lt;Blog&gt;().Id;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;tx.Commit();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;using (ISession s = factory.OpenSession())&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;var blog = s.Load&lt;Blog&gt;(id);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Console.WriteLine(blog.Title);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;And, the actual profiler output:&#xA; &#xA;We can clearly see that we loaded this entity from the second level cache, and that we didn&#x27;t hit the database.&#xA;This is awesome, even if I say so myself.&#xA;Update: Here is the test for this feature:&#xA;[TestFixture]&#xA;public class CanDetect2ndLevelCaching : IntegrationTestBase&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;[Test]&#xA;&#x9;public void Will_detect_entity_load()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ExecuteScenarioInDifferentAppDomain&lt;LoadEntityByIdFromSecondLevelCache&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;var first = observer.Model.Sessions[2]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;.Statements.OfType&lt;StatementModel&gt;().First();&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Assert.AreEqual(&quot;2nd level cache load Blog (1 /* id */)&quot;, first.Text);&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;You might notice that this looks like it is traversing the UI. You are almost correct, it is traversing the View Model, which is an extremely rich model that allow us to do things like on the fly updates to all parts of the UI, Linq reporting and other nice stuff.&#xA;Among the most important benefits that it has is the fact that this is an end to end test of the system. From another app domain executing NHibernate code to the view model being updated by the profiler.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">From the get go, I decided that I wanted NH Prof to work without having an explicit dependency on a particular version of NHibernate. I had trouble with that when I built the NHibernate Query Analyzer, and I had enough of that. This is especially true since I am one of the target audience of NH Prof, and I would hate having to manage NH Prof &lt;---&gt; NHibernate version mapping. So I set out to make NH Prof version tolerant. My explicit goal was to be able to work with NHibernate 2.0 and up. Along the way, I did something that is pretty surprising. NH Prof also work with NHibernate 1.2, which I never even tried to test with. When I say works, I mean that most of the things work as usual, but some of the fine points are missing (for example, I know that showing entity identifiers are not working in 1.2). That is quite encouraging, and probably means that I can support 1.2 fully without too much hassle. But,  It also means that going forward, I am going to have a much easier time with adding new features to NH Prof as they appear in NHibernate. Overall, I am pretty happy about this.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I keep adding new features and fixing strange bugs in NH Prof. Most of those aren&#x27;t really interesting things. &#xA;Does anyone really care about sort order in a particular query? Those are things that are important for the overall UX, but they are not things that I can honestly call them features.&#xA;This thing, however, is a full blown feature. Even if it takes just a tiny bit of screen real estate.&#xA; &#xA;And integrating it into the analysis section of NH Prof as well:&#xA; &#xA;And in the views by method report:&#xA; &#xA;And something that is important to remember, the moment that I have a piece of information, I can start making use of it in alerts and rules. I haven&#x27;t decided yet if I want to do so for the v1.0 release, but I have a feeling that this is going to be a very useful base for additional features.</p>
