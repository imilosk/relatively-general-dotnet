            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here is another post in my series on using Distributed Hash Tables (DHT).  The previous ones are:           Distributed in memory cache / storage            Patterns for using distributed hash tables: Groups            Patterns for using distributed hash tables: Locking      Now I want to talk about locality, and why it is important. First, the idea of locality is very simple. Put related items together, so getting them from the DHT can be done in a single call.  Let us say that we have the following objects in our application: User, Shopping Cart and Session. We can just put them in the DHT, and they may land wherever they want, but that is not the most optimized way to treat them. A DHT call is cheap, but it is still a remote call, and we really want to minimize that. Assuming that we understand the data access patterns in the application, we can do a bit better than making three remote calls to the DHT.  Just about any DHT will support the idea of multi key get, so we can ask the following:     GET &#x27;User #1&#x27;, &#x27;User #1: Session&#x27;, &#x27;User #1: Shopping Cart&#x27;   We need to ensure that when we are writing to the DHT, we will understand that the meaningful key name for node selection is the part that comes before the colon. And the same for reading.  Now, reading all three items, is a single remote call. And that has significant performance implications. Note that you shouldn&#x27;t rely on that too much, otherwise all your data will end up in a single node, but it is a good model to use in many cases, just don&#x27;t go overboard with this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing on the multi tenancy theme. We have the following problem, I now want to focus on the data model, and how you can create an extensible data model.&#xA;In particular, I am thinking about the ability to define something like a base line Customer entity, and allow a tenant to extend that with new fields and behavior. Note that we are talking about both data and behavior here, not on just extending the data. But let us try to take a look at that as well, just to see what solutions we can come up with.&#xA;The scenario that we have is that the tenant would like to define a new set of properties on the customer, such as non smoking preferences and the mother tongue. Let us see how we can deal with it. We will start by focusing solely on the underlying data model, without considering the actual entities.&#xA;Non RDBMS store&#xA;The main problem of storing additional properties in an entity is that we usually map that to an DB, and those really would like to know, upfront, about all the columns and what is the type of each and every column, Going with a non RDBMS store frees us from this limitation, because we can choose a back end store that is can accept any format. A document store like Lucene is a good example, or Google&#x27;s BigTable or a few others that are out there. This means that you can very easily store tuples in the data store, without requiring fixed schema. Extending teh schema for a customer just means giving them the UI to do so (more on that in a future post).&#xA;The ExtraData Column&#xA;Since there are a lot of benefits for a database, we really want to try to deal with hat problem in this context as well. The easiest solution, probably, is having ExternalData XML (or NVARCHAR(MAX) column in all the tables, into which we can tack the specific tenant data. This has the advantage of being very simple to implement, but it has a lot of issues with regards to the resulting data model, being able to query on the data, that the user has added (and is presumedly important. Therefor, we need to consider other options.&#xA;The ExtraInt1, ExtraInt2, ExtraDate1,ExtraDate2, ExrtraStr1, ExtraStr2 Columns&#xA;With this approach you define a few extra columns at the end of each entity&#x27;s table. And allow the user to map his own concepts to those extra columns. This is really nice from the simple perspective of fixed data model, but is a really bad idea from the perspective o understanding what the hell is going on with the system. Because on tenant used ExtraInt1 to store a language Id and another for storing customer weight, trying to understand what this means is extremely hard. Understanding queries, or optimizing them, building meaningful reports, all are going to be very hard to do.&#xA;The Key Value Table&#xA;Using this approach, we have an AdditionalValues table, with the following structure (EntityId, ValueTypeId, StrValue, IntValue, DateValue) as well as ValuesDefinitions table (ValueTypeId, EntityType, Name, DataType). Using this, we can &quot;extend&quot; the data model for an entity by simply defining a ValueDefinition and writing the values. It does tend to make things quite a bit more complicated from the querying side, and reporting on top of this mode is hard, to say the least. Beyond that, it is very flexible, and the last solution that keep us with a fixed schema.&#xA;Extending the customer table&#xA;By this I mean that if we want an additional value, we can simply add the new column to the table, and we are done. It has some complexity with regards to how you intend to manage that (must allow safe changes only, etc), but from the point of view of usage, that is extremely easy. Querying and reporting are a snap, and the only problem looming in the horizon is the next version.&#xA;Let us say that a customer has defined the NaturalLanguage extended column, and marked it as int, with values (2,3,6,8), which are how they represent the values in the rest of the organization. The next version of the product also have NaturalLanguage column, and it is a string with the language code. Problem.&#xA;The Customer_Extended table&#xA;We can deal with this issue by separating the customizations into a separate table, which we will give us a good place to put the new columns, with the same benefits of extending the actual table, but without the versioning issues.&#xA;For myself, I tend to favor the last one, extended data model using either an extension table or the actual table. It is the easiest to manage &amp; grasp, and it has major benefits for the simplicity of the system on the long term.&#xA;So far we have talked only about the actual data model, not how we can extend this with behaviors. I think that I&#x27;ll leave that one for a later post, and only say tat the storage options that you have will affect your ability to get a clean model at the application layer.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing on the multi tenancy theme, let us talk about the actual physical structure of the data store. In general, you have two basic options.&#xA;&#xA;  The TenantId column and separated data stores. The TenantId is simply adding a column to all the columns, showing what tenant the row belongs to.&#xA;&#xA;  The separate data store calls for a much higher level of separation, where there is no shared storage for the tenants.&#xA;&#xA;There are variation on those, such as having separation in the schema level instead of DB level, etc, but they all end up being down to one of those choices.&#xA;The TenantId approach allows you to use a single DB for the entire application, potentially reducing costs for managing the environment. It is also the easiest to explain, we just filter by TenantId and that is it!&#xA;It comes with a whole set of problems that is related to that decision, however:&#xA;&#xA;  Isolation - You have to actively do filtering all the time. This has major issues on your code. And now, tacking TenantId = @CurrentTenant at each query is not going to be sufficient. Consider the case of joins in such an environment, you are likely to get a filter only on the end result, after it was joined already. And that is just one example.&#xA;&#xA;  Backup - The backup strategy that you have for this scenario sucks. Basically, you have to roll your own.&#xA;&#xA;  Customer copy of the data - Going back to the backup strategy? You can&#x27;t just hand the customer the backup. You have to dump the data out, and write something that writes it back in, and it has to be fast.&#xA;&#xA;  Security - you have to let all tenants access the data, security is in the app logic level.&#xA;&#xA;  Extensibility - in a shared environment it is hard to do a lot of extensibility in the data, because each client is stepping on each other toes.&#xA;&#xA;As you probably gathered, I strongly suggest going with the separate model. Now our management strategy is dealing with the connection string. Isolation is built in and doesn&#x27;t require any , for backup you have the vendor tools, and giving the customer its own data is trivial, just send him the backup file. Security is easy, a tenant can access only their DB, and extending this is much easier, because each tenant has their own walled garden to play with.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note: the last time I did even an off the cuff review of a Microsoft application, the whole CAB argument was born. I am writing this statement before looking at the code, mind you, so I have no idea what the review will be.   For a change, let us start by talking about the documentation, which I am reading while the code is downloading.   Multi-Tenant Data Architecture is a very interesting read, I agree to most of what they are saying there, just not with the way they are pushing things and the conclusions they are trying to draw. In particular, we have this graph, showing the economic difference between shared vs. isolated approaches.     I have no idea where they go that data from, or what it is based on. From what I have seen, it is more like this:     And I didn&#x27;t include a whole bunch of stuff that makes shared approach a really bad idea, like the required security audits, risks on data dependencies in shared data, etc.  On to the application itself. This time, I started from the UI, moving inward. In the BasePage, the master page is set according to the tenant alias. There is also the tenant id, but it is very rarely used.  Item of interest, ISitkaSoapService, which is a WCF service that is used for such things as CRUD, will happily accept SQL from the user. I&#x27;ll not even try to talk about the validations that they have there, accepting SQL from the client is a mistake unless you are an DB Server. And that is at the architecture level.  I went a little bit deeper, but at some point (around 03:30 AM) I decided that I am not getting to get anything new from this, and there isn&#x27;t much of a point in posting a code review for that.  Oh, and just to make things more interesting, LitwareHR is not a multi tenant application by my definition. It is an application that can handle data from several clients, and it have skinning, but that about it. Yes, it has the idea of tacking fields to an entity, that is about as close as it gets to what I would consider multi tenancy.  What it is, in my eyes, is just a normal application, with a need for dynamic fields, that is. Show me different behavior across tenants, different entities. And by that I don&#x27;t mean just Customer &#x2B; Comtoso.FriendlyName, I am talking about something that actually does something with the extra data, rather than just display it.     Note: After reading this post, I had seriously considered not publishing it, see the CAB episode for reference on why. I decided to publish it anyway, see CAB episode for why.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The question just came up in the NHibernate dev list, and I wanted to be as clear about this as possible.&#xA;If you can at all avoid it, do so. The use of SQL in NHibernate should be strongly discouraged. It is there to give you the ability to use the proprietary features of your database, and as a way to avoid the abstraction if you really need that.&#xA;The problem is when people are using that for things that they really shouldn&#x27;t, like complex queries that they know how to express in SQL but not using NHibernate, so they drop to that. This is not what it is for, and it will bite you later.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Wikipedia defines Multi Tenancy as:&#xA;&#xA;  Multitenancy refers to the architectural principle, where a single instance of the software runs on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendor&#x27;s servers, serving multiple client organizations (tenants). Multitenancy is contrasted with a multi-instance architecture where separate software instances (or hardware systems) are set up for different client organizations. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration so that each client organization works with a customized virtual application instance.&#xA;&#xA;My definition of multi tenant includes a single instance service multiple tenants and multiple instances, one for each tenant. In fact, it would also include the idea of a product line as well. Or, like I like to think about it, perhaps it is product lines that are used in multi tenant scenarios.&#xA;Let us start from the beginning. We have a need for building an application that can handle several tenant. A typical example would be Invoicing System that we can sell to different clients. Note that I explicitly don&#x27;t care in this scenario how the application is deployed. It may be at the client site, hosted in as multi instance or single instance. The only thing that is important in this scenario is that the application is the same for all tenants.&#xA;That is, they have no, or very little, customizations options. By customizations I don&#x27;t mean having the ability to change the logo or the skin, but true customization. Changing the way the system behaves, extending the domain, adding more UI, adding more behavior, editing existing behavior, etc.&#xA;If you don&#x27;t have customization, then you really have very little issue, you can take a standard application and deal with the tenants as purely infrastructure concern (yes, I know that you need a bit more control than that, but bear with me).&#xA;If you do need this customization behavior, then it doesn&#x27;t matter what your deployment strategy is, the important issue is that you have to support multiple parallel customizations to your application, including the ability to extend the model and override the application behavior. And that is applicable for product lines as well as multi tenant applications.&#xA;As it turn out, there isn&#x27;t a lot of actual challenge in making such an application once you have an IoC in place, you can trivially change services and model without any issues. The problems are with the extension strategy, customization management, tenant management and conventions emplacement and enforcements.&#xA;I am going to talk some more about this in the future, but that will go down into the gory details and will be a real zoo.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">No, I am not going to talk about how to design a system, I am going to take it as granted that you are aware on all the traditional checklists for good design and are actively applying them. What I wold like to talk about are the parts that a lot of people tend to forget until they find out about it after the system is already at the hands of the users.&#xA;I am going to talk about Rhino Security as an example to that. The predecessor for Rhino Security was a proprietary piece of software that worked on top of some incredibly confusing set of business rules. (You may not see a product vNext if you have a contract for vPrev in the last year over some dollar value, as an example). Rhino Security&#x27;s design was heavily influenced by that project, including the inclusion, as a first level concept, of the &quot;explain the reasons for this security decision&quot;. The hours I spent debugging the security system only to find out that it was absolutely correct has thought me that much, if nothing else.&#xA;So the hooks for make the system understandable are built in, they are explicit and the design and are a major advantage when it comes the time to implement, experiment and deploy the system.&#xA;Another important concern is handling errors, logging, tracing and alerts are all important concepts. Do you have a backup procedure? Do it have a way to SHOUT that the backup have failed? Do you have scheduled jobs? Do you get NOTIFIED when they do? (A lot of the problem in software occur when a scheduled job hasn&#x27;t been running for three months straight)&#xA;You ask the system to do some operation. In any sort of non trivial system, figuring out why it reached this decision is as important, if not more so, than the decision / operation made. Do you plan for that? Logging isn&#x27;t it. I am talking about planing for that at the infrastructure and operation levels, exposing this as a first level ability/feature in the user interface and making this visible. Give the user control over what the system is doing. You&#x27;ll find that the level of understanding that they gain from it will enable them to get a far higher productivity.&#xA;As an aside, it is extremely helpful in troubleshooting, but that is beside the point.&#xA;Is your system stable? Stable in the sense that new features don&#x27;t break old ones, that deploying a new version is a straightforward process. Stable in the sense that the approaches you take in the beginning of the project are stable enough to last the lifetime of the project (another way of putting this, avoid hacks in the infrastructure).&#xA;The development environment. Have you given it any thought? Do you have a well defined process for developing new functionality? (Well defined process == you have thought it out, not documented it in excruciating details). Did you consider the source control story? Did you consider the ability to split the system into independent parts?&#xA;Versioning concerns - do you need to run in a multi version environment? Do you need to support just upgrade from old version?&#xA;Tracing / auditing - this is BAM, but I don&#x27;t like the term. Do you have the ability to see what the system is doing?&#xA;As you can see, we have a few separate grouping here. One is visibility and transparency of the system, second is operational issues, and last is the developer environment story. I find that all too often people are ignoring those issues completely, in favor of complete focus on architecture and application design. Those are important, but they are only part of the story.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">That was the first thing out of my mouth when I saw a diagram the day before yesterday. The diagram was of a domain model and included four entities.&#xA;No, I can&#x27;t see the future and extrapolate from customer/order/order lines whatever the system is going to scale or not. I wasn&#x27;t talking about the system scalability at all. I was thinking of using the diagram as the main means for expressing concepts. A single diagram is just not a good solution for showing any sort of a complex concept. At that particular case, the diagram is a view on top of a model, so the issue wasn&#x27;t really relevant,&#xA;It did, however, made me think about my use of scalable. I make the word work for its living, because for me, it means:&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable traditional - can we make the system handle more operations&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable complexity - when we increase the complexity of the problem, do we need to increase the complexity of the solution by the same amount, by doubling or tripling the complexity?&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable maintainability - how much work do I need to do in order to maintain this application? Is the work required going to rapidly increase over time?&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable size - as the project grow, do I have the facilities for it? That means, can I split the work between developers / teams? Will VS become extremely slow with huge amount of projects? Do I have an SCM strategy planned.&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable management - as the project grow, how are we going to manage that?&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable IT - as the project grows, do we have the tooling in place to actually understand the application in production. Remote Debugging doesn&#x27;t work.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got an assistance request for Rhino Mocks directly to my email about forty minutes go. As usual, and as outlined here, I asked that the question be sent to the relevant mailing list. I get a lot of such requests, and that it my standard response for most of them, when they are on the list, other people have a shot at that, and the answer is a searchable record. If you want to something more, we can discuss my rates.  Anyway, I am getting of lot of such requests, and I am perfectly fine with redirecting them to the mailing list. But twenty minutes after I replied to the first email, another one got into my inbox. Same guy, same question.    He got the same reply, as you can see.  Just to make this clear, I welcome questions and discussions, I currently (as in, today) carry ~7 of them from people who just thought they could ask me a question. But I might as well decide that I am not interested in having a discussion in private email, and ask to turn that to the relevant mailing list. It mostly depends on how interesting is the question. So feel free to contact me if you have something you want to talk about, but do consider that the mailing lists are usually a better place for that and I might turn you that way anyway.   And no, I don&#x27;t intend to make a habit of putting annoying people on the blog. And yes, it took me longer to write this blog post than it would have to answer the question.</p>
