            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a small part from a larger benchmark that we run:  &#xA0; The index in question is using a DateTime field, and as you can see, quite a lot of time is spent in translating that. 50% of our time, in fact. That is&#x2026; not so nice.  The question now is why we do it? Well, let us look at the code:   Here we can see several things, first, there is the small issue with us allocating the string to check if it is a date, but that isn&#x2019;t where the money is. That is located in the TryParseExact. This method is actually quite impressive. Given a pattern, it parses the pattern, then it parse the provided string. And if we weren&#x2019;t calling it hundreds of thousands of times, I&#x2019;m sure that it wouldn&#x2019;t be an issue.&#xA0; But we are, so we are left with writing our own routine to do this in a hard coded manner. I built the following benchmark to test this out:  As you can see, this is pretty much identical to our code, and should tell us how good we are. Here are the benchmark results:     Method  Platform  Jit  Toolchain  Runtime  Median  StdDev   ParseDateTime  X64  RyuJit  Host  Host  2,458.2915 ns  102.7071 ns   ParseDateTime  X86  Host  Clr  Clr  2,506.7353 ns  142.7946 ns   ParseDateTime  X86  LegacyJit  Host  Host  2,443.4806 ns  51.4903 ns In my next post, I&#x2019;ll show what I came up with that can beat this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">System administrators like to see graphs with server utilizations sitting at the very low end of the scale. That means that they don&#x2019;t need to worry about spikes, capacity or anything much, they are way over provisioned, and that means less waking up at night. That works very well, until you hit a real spike, hit some sort of limit, and then have to scramble to upgrade your system while under fire, so to speak. [I have plenty of issues with the production team behavior as described in this post, but that isn&#x2019;t the topic for this post.] So one of the things that we regularly test is a system being asked to do something that is beyond its limits. For example, have 6 indexes running at the same time, indexing at different speeds, a dataset that is 57GB in size. The idea is that we will force the system to do a lot of work that it could typically avoid by having everything in memory. Instead, we&#x2019;ll be forced to page data, and we need to see how we behave under such a scenario. Here is what this looks like from the global system behavior.  If you&#x2019;ll show this to most admins, they will feel faint. That usually means Something Is About To Break Badly.  But things are slightly better when we look at the details:   So what do we have here? We have a process that (at the time of running it, has mapped about 67 GB of files, and has allocated 8.5 GB of RAM). However, only about 4.5 GB of that is actively used, and the rest of the working set is actually the memory mapped files. That lead to an interesting observation, if most of your work is local and transient (so you scan through sections of the file, like we do during indexing), the operating system will load those pages from disk, and keep them around until there is memory pressure, at which point it will look at all of those nice pages that are just sitting them, unmodified and with a source on disk.  That means that the operating can immediately discard them without having to page them out. So that means that they are very cheap. Oh, we&#x2019;ll still need to load the data from disk into them, but we&#x2019;ll have to do that anyway, since we can&#x2019;t fit the entire dataset into memory. So that means that our allocation strategy basically goes something like this:  Ignore the actually free space the operating system report. Instead, take into account the private working set and compare it to the actual working set. The private working set is what goes into the page file, it mostly consists of managed memory and whatever unmanaged allocations we have to do during the indexing. So by comparing the two, we can tell how much of the used memory is actually used by memory mapped files. We are careful to ensure that we leave about 25% of the system memory to the memory mapped files (otherwise we&#x2019;ll do a lot of paging), but that still gives us leave to use quite a lot of memory to speed things up, and we can negotiate between the threads to see who is faster (and thus deserve more memory).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my preview post, I mentioned that removing artificial batch limits has caused us to double our performance. But what are those artificial batch limits? Well, anything that doesn&#x2019;t involve actual system resources. For example, limit batch size by time or by document count is artificial. We used to have to do that as a correlation to the amount of managed memory we use, and because it allowed us to parallelize I/O and computation work. Now, each index is actually working on its own, so if one index is stalling because it need to fetch data, other indexes will use the available core, and every one will be happy.  Effectively, an indexing batch stopped being a global database event that we had to fetch data for specifically and became something much smaller. That fact alone gave us leeway to remove drastic amounts of code to handle things like prefetching, I/O / memory / time / CPU balancing and a whole bunch of really crazy stuff that we had to do. So all of that went away, and we learned that anything that would artificially reduce a batch size is bad, that we should make the batch size as big as possible to benefit from economy of scale effects. But wait, what about non artificial limits? For example, running an indexing batch take some memory. We can now track it much better, and most of it is in unmanaged memory anyway, so we don&#x2019;t worry about keeping it around for a long time. We do worry about running out of it, though. If we have six indexes all running at the same time, each trying to use as much of the system resources as it possible could. Of course, if we actually let them to that they would allocate enough memory to push us into the page file, resulting in all our beautiful code spending all its time just paging in and out from disk, and our performance looking like it was hit in the face repeatedly with the hard disk needle. So we have a budget. In fact, we have a pretty complete heuristics system in place.  Start by giving each index 16 MB to run. Whenever the index exceed that budget, allow it to complete the current operation (typically a single document, so pretty small) Check if there is enough memory available* that we can still use, and if so, increase the budget by another 16 MB * Enough memory available is actually a really complex idea, enough so that I&#x2019;ll dedicate the next post to it. So that leads us to all indexes competing with one another to get more memory, until we hit the predefined limit (which is supposed to allow us memory to do other work as well). At that point, we hit a real limit, and we stop the batch, complete our work and carry on. After the batch is completed, we could release all of that memory and start from scratch, but that would probably be a waste, we already know that we haven&#x2019;t gone too badly over budget, so why release all that precious memory just to immediately require it again? So that is what we did, and we run our benchmarks again. And the performance was not nice to us. It took a while to figure out what happened, but you can see this on the following graph.  We started allocating memory, and as you can see, we have some indexes that have high memory requirement. At some point, we have hit the memory ceiling we specified, and started completing batches so we won&#x2019;t use too much memory. All well and good. Except that the act of completing the batch will also (sometimes) release memory. This is typically done because we have found the ideal sizes we need for processing, so we discard everything that is too small. But the allocator is free to release memory if it thinks that this is the best for the system. Unfortunately, we didn&#x2019;t adjust the budget in this case. Consider the case of indexes C &amp; F, both of which released significant amount of memory after the batch was completed. Index B, which was forced to make do with whatever memory it managed to grab, suddenly finds itself in a position to grab more memory, and it will slowly increase its budgets and allocations. At the same time, indexes C &amp; F are also going to allocate more memory, after all, they are well within their budget, since we didn&#x2019;t account for the released memory that was gobbled up by index B. The fact that this starts happening only about 45 minutes into the batch, and it actually shows up as higher memory utilization about 4 hours after that is really quite annoying when you need to debug it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We&#x2019;ve been running all sort of benchmarks on RavenDB, ranging from micro optimizations to a single heavily used routine that focused on re-ordering the instructions so the CPU can execute them in parallel to large scale load testing and data processing. This tale is about the later. We have defined 6 indexes over a data set of over 18 million documents with a total size of 57GB. We then run it on a system that had 16GB of RAM (and typically had a lot less actually available). When we started, we very quickly run out of memory, in fact, our allocations exceeded the database size (so we allocated over 60 GB) before we decided to focus on fixing that. The problem was the scope of the batch, it was too long, and we didn&#x2019;t reuse the memory inside the same batch. Once that was fixed, we were able to run the performance test successfully. Total time to run it? Over 9 hours. Granted, this is talking about 6 indexes each needing to go over the entire dataset, so we expect it to take a while, and it is much faster than in previous versions, but that is still far too much. I should probably explain that the whole point of doing something like that is to see the interference effects. What happen when you have a bunch of competing indexes over the same resources (CPU, memory, disk)? Turn out, there is a lot going there, and you can&#x2019;t really get good profiling results from this kind of run&#xA0; (to start with, the profiling overhead would push this into a multi day effort), and while we captured some profiling run of shorter stats, we weren&#x2019;t really able to pinpoint the blame.  So we added the tooling we needed to figure it out, and then put that in the studio. The end result was&#x2026; not so good.  Yes, that is the studio trying to display the debug information for that benchmark. It&#x2026; did not go so well for us. In other words, before we could fix the benchmark, we had to optimize the code that would tell us where we are spending all that time in the benchmark . As it turned out, the problem was that our code was optimizing for problems we no loner had. Basically, in RavenDB 3.x we have to take into account our memory usage, and pretty much all of it is managed memory. That lead to some interesting problems, to whit, we don&#x2019;t know how much memory we use. The fact that a document is size so and so when serialized to disk means exactly squat with regards to how much it is actually going to take in memory. And because too much allocations lead to higher GC costs down the road, we put term limits on the size of the indexing batches we&#x2019;ll process. Effectively, we will take a certain amount of documents to process in a batch, and then complete the batch. All the memory we used in the batch will go away, and hopefully we didn&#x2019;t push too much of it into higher generations. But the real costs that we have in RavenDB 4.x are very different. To start with, we use a lot less managed operations, and we use Voron for pretty much everything. That means that our costs has now shifted, instead of worrying about releasing the memory as quickly as possible, we need to worry about reducing the number of times we go to disk. As it turns out, artificially reducing the batch size results in us processing more batches, which require us to hit the disk a lot more. The same logic applies to RavenDB 3.x (and we have users who have configured RavenDB to have very long batches for exactly that reason), but that come at GC cost that simply does not exist in RavenDB 4.0. The immediate solution was to remove all the batch limits and see what would happen. Overall performance had doubled. We were able to process the same amount of information in about half the time. And that is before we did deep dive with a profiler to seek inefficiencies.</p>
