            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The last production postmortem that I blogged about in real time was almost a year ago. This is something that makes me very happy, considering the uptick we see in RavenDB usage. All the efforts we put into making RavenDB more stable, predictable and robust has been paying off. The &#x201C;downside&#x201D; of that is that I have less interesting stories to tell, of course, but I&#x2019;ll live with that. Today&#x2019;s story, however, is about the nastiest of problems. An occasional slow down in production that cause RavenDB to halt for about 5 seconds. The killer is that this is something that would only reproduce after several weeks of running, and it isn&#x2019;t consistent. Once in a while, without any consistency, RavenDB would appear to stop processing requests for a period of a few seconds, and then resume normally. Those kind of bugs are the worst, because it is very hard to narrow down exactly what is going on, even before we get to trying to figure out the root cause. We quickly ruled out the usual suspects. There was no high CPU, swapping to disk or slow I/O that can explain it. We tested the underlying hardware and it seemed fine as well. The problem would usually be quickly fixed if you restarted RavenDB, but sometimes that wasn&#x2019;t enough. Restarting the whole server was required to get back to the baseline performance. Note that usually, RavenDB performed just fine, it is just that occasionally it would pause. This naturally made us suspect that we have some issue with the GC causing pauses, but it didn&#x2019;t make sense. Our allocation rates weren&#x2019;t high and we didn&#x2019;t have that big of a managed heap. In short, pretty much all avenues of investigation looked like they were closed to us.We took several dumps of the process state and inspected what was going on there. Pretty much all indications pointed to there being an issue with the GC, but we couldn&#x2019;t figure out why. Then we started to analyze the dump file in more detail, here is everything in the dump that was over 100MB:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

So nothing really that interesting. The number of strings was high, I&#x2019;ll admin, much higher than what we&#x2019;ll usually find in a RavenDB process, but this database instance was doing heavy indexing, so that was probably the reason for this.But pay very close attention to the second item from the end. That is about 800 MB (!!) of ThreadLocal&lt;WeakReference&gt;.LinkedSlotVolatile array. And that was suspicious. We looked into this a bit more and discovered that we had this tidbit:00007f8203682ce0&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 50062&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 2002480 System.Threading.ThreadLocal`1[[System.WeakReference, System.Private.CoreLib]]To start with, that isn&#x2019;t too bad. We have 2MB or so of ThreadLocal&lt;WeakReference&gt; instances, no big deal. But look at the instance count (which is the second column). We had over 50,000 of those. And that didn&#x2019;t seem right at all.We started to investigate how ThreadLocal&lt;T&gt; works, and we found that it is really interesting. Here is the in memory structure of a ThreadLocal&lt;T&gt;. The internal structure is quite interesting:Each ThreadLocal&lt;T&gt; instance has an id, which is generated sequentially. For each thread, there is a static thread local array that is allocated to store the values for this thread. The id of the ThreadLocal instance is used to index into this array. The array is for the local thread, but all the values across all threads for a particular ThreadLocal are held together as a doubly linked list. Note that ThreadLocal has a trackAllValues constructor parameter that does not affect this behavior at all. It simply control whatever you are allowed to call the Values property, not whatever the thread local instance will track all the values.Due to reasons that I&#x2019;ll get to later, we created a lot of ThreadLocal instances. That means that we had instance ids in the high tens of thousands. When allocating the thread static array, the ThreadLocal will allocate an array that can hold its id (to the next power of two). So if we have a ThreadLocal with id of 50,062, it will allocate an array with 65,536 elements. That would explain the amount of memory that we saw in the memory dump and is interesting all on its own. It did not explain the problem with the GC. At least, not yet. As we looked further into this issue, we noticed that this problem only occurred on very large database instances. Ones that had dozens of databases and many indexes. One of the ways that RavenDB ensure isolation of components is to have them each run in a different thread. In those machines,we have had processes that run with thousands of threads, usually in the range of 3000 to 6000. Combine what we know about ThreadLocal and the number of threads, and you might start to see the problem. Not all ThreadLocals are used in all threads, but when they do, we need to allocate an array that is 65,536 elements in each of the threads. That translate to a total size that is measured in hundreds of millions.That explains the size, again, but what about the GC speed? I wrote a small isolated test to see what this looks like and I was able to reproduce this on its own. That was really interesting, but I didn&#x2019;t think that the issue was with ThreadLocal directly. Rather, the problem was with the lattice like structure that we have here. Because of this, I decided to check what it would cost for the GC to run on such a system without dealing with intermediaries.Here is what this looks like:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Given how the GC works, it makes sense. And that means that the accidental lattice structure that we create using ThreadLocal is at the root of our troubles. The question is why do we have so many of them.Internally, inside Lucene, there is a ThreadLocal&lt;WeakReference&gt; that is being used when you use a particular feature. This is used once per segment, so it isn&#x2019;t too bad. However, consider what happens over time in a process that have thousands of indexes and is constantly busy? Each indexing run will create a segment, and each one of them will have a ThreadLocal instance. At the same time, we also have a lot of threads, which create this exact scenario. The problem slowly accumulate over time. As you have more and more indexing runs, you&#x2019;ll have more and more such instances and you&#x2019;ll get to bigger and bigger arrays on each thread. This explains why we are able to see the issue only on instances that have been running for weeks, and then, only on those instances that run a particular set of queries that make use of this feature.We reported the issue to the .NET team and I&#x2019;m very curious about what the end result will be here. On our end, we are going to have to revamp how we are handling this type of situation. We have a plan of action already and we&#x2019;ll see over the next week or so how it plays out in production load.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The 4th fallacy of distributed computing is that the network is secured. It is a fallacy because sooner or later, you&#x2019;ll realize that the network isn&#x2019;t secured. Case in point, Microsoft managed to put 250 million support tickets on the public internet. The underlying issue is actually pretty simple. Microsoft had five Elastic Search instances with no security or authentication.From the emails that were sent, it seems that they were intend to be secured by separating them from the external networks using firewall rules. A configuration error meant that the firewall rule was no long applicable and they were exposed to the public internet. In this case, at least, I can give better marks than &#x201C;did you really put a publicly addressable database on the internet in the days of Shodan?&#x201D; It isn&#x2019;t a matter of if you&#x2019;ll be attacked, it is an issue of when. And according to recent reports, the time it takes from being network accessible to being attacked is under a minute. At worst, it took less than a couple of hours for attacks to start.&#xA0; If it is accessible, it will be attacked. So it is was good from Microsoft to make sure that it wasn&#x2019;t accessible, right? Except that it then became accessible. How much are you willing to bet that there was no monitoring on &#x201C;these machine is not accessible from the internet&#x201D;? For that matter, I&#x2019;m not sure how you can write a monitoring system that check for this. The security assumptions changed, and the systems wasn&#x2019;t robust to handle that. What is worse, it didn&#x2019;t fail close. It failed wide open.The underlying cause of this mess is that the assumption that you can trust the network. It is closed, secured and safe. So there was no additional line of defense. When we designed RavenDB&#x2019;s security, we started from the assumption that any RavenDB node is publicly accessible and will be attacked. As such, we don&#x2019;t allow you to run RavenDB on anything but the loopback device without setting up security. Even when you are running inside locked network, you&#x2019;ll still have mutual authentication between client and server, you&#x2019;ll still have all communications between client and server encrypted. Defense in depth is the only thing that make sense. Yes, it is belt and suspenders, but it means that if you have a failure, your privates aren&#x2019;t hanging in the wind, waiting to be sold on the Dark Web.When designing a system that listen to the network, you have to start from assuming you&#x2019;ll be attacked. And any additional steps to reduce the attack surface are just that. They&#x2019;ll reduce it, not eliminate it. Because a firewall may fail or be misconfigured, and it may not happen to you. But if a completely separate machine on your closed network has been compromised, you best hope that it won&#x2019;t be able to be a bridgehead for the rest of your system.This attack expose 250,000,000 support records(!) and it was observed because it was obvious. This is the equivalent of a big pile of money landing at your feet. It gets noticed. But let&#x2019;s assume that the elastic node was an empty one, so it wouldn&#x2019;t be interesting. It takes very little from having access to an unsecured server to being able to execute code on it. And then you have a bridgehead. You can then access other servers, which may be accessible from the opened server, but not for the whole wide world. If they aren&#x2019;t secured, well, it doesn&#x2019;t matter what your firewall rules say anymore&#x2026;The network is always hostile. You can&#x2019;t assume who is on the other side, or that you aren&#x2019;t being eavesdropped on. Luckily, we have fairly routine counter measures. Use TLS for everything and make sure that you authenticate. How you do it doesn&#x2019;t matter that much, to be honest. User / pass over HTTPS or X509 certificate are just different options. And while I can debate which ones are the best, anything is going to better than nothing at all. This applies for in house software as well. You microservices should authenticate, even if they are running in the isolated backend. Yes, it can be a PITA to configure and deploy, but it isn&#x2019;t really something that you can give up on. Because the network is always hostile.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into a really interesting discussion on Twitter, I suggest you go over the whole thread, it is fascinating reading. I have written DI / IoC business applications for a decade and I was heavily involved at a popular IoC container for about five years, including implementing some core features (open generic binding, which was a PITA to do). Given the scope of the topic, I didn&#x2019;t want to try to squeeze my thoughts on the subject into a Twitter soundbite, hence, this post.A couple of weeks ago I posted about how I would start a new project today. With just enough architecture to get things started, and not much more. Almost implicit in my design is the fact that the system is composable. You add functionality to the system not by modifying existing code but by adding code. That isn&#x2019;t new by any means. A quick search of my blog shows a series of posts from 2012 and a system architecture from 2008. No new ground trodden here, then. So why bother writing this post?RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t use a container. This is a pretty big and non trivial project that has no container involved. In fact, I don&#x2019;t usually pull in containers any longer. For a long while, I tried to push as much complexity as possible into the container. It helped that I was part of the team building the container, so I could actually go ahead and add features to the container. That allowed me to create a system that was driven by convention. As long as you followed the convention, things magically worked and everyone was productive. If you didn&#x2019;t follow the convention, well, I would need to debug that. Other people on the team could figure things out, but it generally fell on me (not that I minded).The backend for RavenDB Cloud is the first time in a while that I took part in what you can consider as a business application rather than an infrastructure component. And that backend uses a container, IoC, interfaces, multiple dispatch, etc. It makes for a codebase that can adapt quickly, but also adds complexity. In the case of the cloud backend, just to name a few core features, we have: storage, machine allocations, recovery from failure, billing and monitoring. Each one of those may have multiple implementations (each cloud does storage and deployment differently, different accounts have different plans, etc).&#xA0; Much of this is handled via implementing the relevant interfaces and dispatching to the right location based on the context of the operation. In many ways, it works like magic. And it allows us to iterate quick and deploy to three separate cloud providers in a short amount of time. It is also magic. Much of our team is actually infrastructure developers. That has a totally different mindset than business app development. When I saw how these developers, with the infrastructure background, worked with the cloud backend, it was very instructive. To them, it was magic, and impenetrable at first. Interestingly enough, they didn&#x2019;t need to understand all that was going on to get things done. We made sure that they did, after a while, but the IoC allowed us to ignore such concerns until later (gimme a cluster, don&#x2019;t worry about how it is wired to the rest of the system).The auto-wiring is one part of what you&#x2019;ll typically get from a container. There are other, equally important parts, that don&#x2019;t generally get as much attention: Using IoC usually means a decomposed systems, which is easier to test independently. And in addition to satisfying dependencies, the container is also in charge of managing the lifetime (or scope) of instances.Let&#x2019;s talk about the decomposed system and isolated testing first, because this tend to be a high priority for many people. I&#x2019;m against such systems. Not because it makes testing easier (although keep that in mind, I&#x2019;ll have something to say about it shortly) but because it is generally a very short slippery slope toward interface explosion. You end up with a lot of interfaces that have a single implementation. You now have composition issue, it is hard to figure out what is the flow of the code because everything is dynamically composed. That lead to a bunch of problems when you read the code (you have to jump around to understand what is going on) as well as performance issues (you can&#x2019;t inline methods, you have to do interface calls, etc). Out of those, the first issue is far more important, mind. Surprisingly, given that we have decomposed to small pieces to be able to work with each item independently, we are now in a much worst position if we want to change something. Because the code is scattered in many different locations and is composed on the fly, if I want to make a significant change, I have to make it in many places. To give a concrete example, let&#x2019;s say that I need to pass a correlation token through my system, to do distributed tracing. I have to modify pretty much all the interfaces involved to pass this token through. And that lead us to the issue I promised with the tests. A system that is composed of independent interfaces / implementations is easy to test in isolation. Because each implementation is independent and isolated from other areas of the system. The issue with such a system is that each individual component isn&#x2019;t really doing much on its own. The benefit of the system is from multiple such components are assembled and working together. So the critical functionality that you have is the composed bundle, as well as the container configuration. But to test that, you need a system test. So you might as well structure you system so that system tests are easy, fast and obvious. Here is another way to do just that. Finally, we get to the issue of lifetime management. It is easy to ignore just how important this feature is. Usually, you have three lifetimes in your application:Singleton &#x2013; for the entire application.Transient &#x2013; get a new instance each time.Scoped &#x2013; get the same instance in the same scope (typically a single requests).Being able to rely on the container to manage lifetime is huge, because it is easy to mess things up. A good container will also match dependencies by their lifetimes. So if you have a singleton component it cannot accept a transient component since the lifetimes don&#x2019;t match (but the other way around is obviously fine). There is an issue here as well. If you are injecting the dependencies, it is easy to lose track of the lifetime of your dependencies. It is easy to get into a situation where you (inadvertently, even) use a dependency to manage state between invocations and not realize that you have now relying on the lifetime of a dependency (or a dependency of dependency).You might have noticed a theme in this post. I&#x2019;m outlining a lot of problems, but no solutions. I&#x2019;ll get to that in a bit, but I wanted to explain something important. Writing non trivial software is complex. This is the nature of the beast. We can re-arrange the complexity or we can sweep it under the rug. There are good use cases for either option, but I would rather that people make this choice explicitly. What you can&#x2019;t do is eliminate the complexity entirely, at best, you have tamed it.Earlier, I said that RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t use a container, which is true (somewhat). But it is using inversion of control. A lot of the core classes are using constructor injection, for example. Let&#x2019;s take what is probably the most important class we have, DocumentDatabase. That is the class that represent a database inside a RavenDB process. It accept its dependencies (the configuration, the server it is running on, etc) and then is constructed. We don&#x2019;t use a container here because the setup process of a database in RavenDB is complex. We first create the DocumentDatabase instance, then we have to initialize it. Initializing a database may mean running recovering, loading a lot of data from disk, etc. So we do that in an async manner. When a request comes in for a particular database, we get it, or wait until it is loaded. We will also dispose the database if it has been idle for enough time. So in this case, we have complex (async) initialization, in which we have to deal with a lot of failure modes. We also have a lifetime scope that is based on idle time, which doesn&#x2019;t fit the usual modes for a container.Because we manually control how we create the database instance, it is explicit what its dependencies, lifetime and behavior are. We have quite a few example of such classes. For example, the database instance holds DocumentStorage, AttachmentStorage, etc. It is important to note that the number if finite and relatively small. It allow us to reason about the interaction in the database in a static and predictable manner. Remember when I said that we don&#x2019;t use a container? That is almost true. There is one location where I wrote our own mini container. One thing that RavenDB has a lot of is Endpoints. An endpoint is the method that handles a particular HTTP request. At last count we had over 300 of them. I don&#x2019;t have the time / willingness to wire all of these manually. That would put undue burden on developing a new endpoint. And that is the key observation. For stuff that doesn&#x2019;t change very often (the structure of the database), we do things manually. For the things that we add a lot of (endpoints), we make it as smooth as possible. Adding a new endpoint is adding a class that inherit from a known base class, and that is pretty much it.Our routing infrastructure will gather all of the implementation, wire up the routing and when a request come in will create an instance of the class in question, inject it the relevant context (what database it is running on, the current request, etc) and then execute it. Just like a container would, in fact, because for all intents and purposes, it is one. What we have done is optimize one aspect, which we deal with often, while manually dealing with the stuff that is rarely changing. That means that if I do need to make a change there, the level of magic involved is greatly reduced. And in RavenDB in particular, we can and have measured the difference in performance between running things through any abstraction layer and doing things directly. To the point where in certain parts of our codebase, an interface method invocation is forbidden because the cost would be too high.There is another aspect of this architecture, it means that the easiest thing in our code would be to add a new endpoint. That being the easiest thing, it is usually what will happen. This means that we&#x2019;re far more likely to follow the open/closed principal. It also lead to most of our code looking fairly similar in shape. That make maintenance, code reviews and the act of writing new code a lot simpler. I don&#x2019;t have to make decisions about structure, I just have to let the code flow.</p>

We could also query over all documents that match a particular query, of course. One thing to note, however, is that time series queries are done on a per time series basis and each time series belong to a particular document.In other words, if I want to ask a question about time series data across documents, I can&#x2019;t just query for it, I need to do some prep work first. This is done to ensure that when you query, we&#x2019;ll be able to give you the right results, fast.As a reminder, we have a bunch of nodes that we record metrics of. The metrics so far are:Storage &#x2013; [ Number of objects, Total size used, Total storage size].Network &#x2013; [Total bytes in, Total bytes out]We record these metrics for each node at regular intervals. The query above can give us space utilization over time in a particular node, but there are other questions that we would like to ask. For example, given an upload request, we want to find the node with the most free space. Note that we record the total size used and the total storage available only as time series metrics. So how are we going to be able to query on it? The answer is that we&#x2019;ll use indexes. In particular, a map/reduce index, like the following:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Usually in RavenDB, the source of an index is a docs.[Collection], such as docs.Users. In this case, we are using a timeseries index, so the source is timeseries.[Collection].[TimeSeries]. In this case, we operate over the Storage timeseries on the Nodes collection. When we create an index over a timeseries, we are exposed to some internal structural details. Each timestamp in a timeseries isn&#x2019;t stored independently. That would be incredibly wasteful to do. Instead, we store timeseries together in segments. The details about how and why we do that don&#x2019;t really matter, but what does matter is that when you create an index over timeseries, you&#x2019;ll be indexing the segment as a whole. You can see how the map access the Entries collection on the segment, getting the last one (the most recent) and output it. The other thing that is worth noticing in the map portion of the index is that we operate on the values of the time stamp. In this case, Values[2] is the total amount of storage available and Values[1] is the size used. The reduce portion of the index, on the other hand, is identical to any other map/reduce index in RavenDB.What this index does, essentially, is tell us what is the most up to date free space that we have for each particular node. As for querying it, let&#x2019;s see how that works, shall we?Here we are asking for the node with the least disk space that can contain the data we want to write. This can be reduce fragmentation in the system as a whole, by ensuring that we use the best fit method.Let&#x2019;s look at a more complex example of indexing time series data, computing the total network usage for each node on a monthly basis. This is not trivial because we record network utilization on a regular basis, but need to aggregate that over whole months.Here is the index definition:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

This is done because a single segment may contain data from multiple months. We then sum up the values for each month and compute the total in the reduce.The nice thing about this feature is that we are able to aggregate large amount of data and benefit from the usual advantages of RavenDB map/reduce indexes. We have already massaged the data to the right shape, so queries on it are fast.Time series indexes in RavenDB allows us to merge time series data from multiple documents, I could have aggregated the computation above across multiple nodes to get the total per customer, so I&#x2019;ll know how much to charge them at the end of the month, for example.I would be happy to know hear about any other scenarios that you can think of for using timeseries in RavenDB, and in particular, what kind of queries you&#x2019;ll want to do on the data.</p>
