            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Most interesting applications have some sort of a business rules inside of them. This is the part where most sane programmers are left wondering: &quot;You work like this and you make money?&quot;    Of course, usually it&#x27;s because the business works like that it manages to make money. I believe that the classical example is a software to manage&#xA0;the real estate business, where the various options that you can gives the client can make or break a deal.    One problem I run into with writing those rules is efficency. No, I&#x27;m not worried (much) about efficency yet (although I do consider revoking my statement about the post decrement operator, in the name of performance :-) ). I do keep certain things in the front of my mind, and in this case, the business scenario and application efficency are going hand in hand.    The issue is simple: I want to run a set of business rules on an object graph. In order to validate the object graph, the rules will need to access the database for further information. This is a point where I want to reduce to a minimum the number of request that are made to the database and the amount of data that would be transfered. The user wants to get a response as soon as he thinks about the problem,&#xA0;and we wants to make sure that the answer is relevant to the question asked.    Let&#x27;s consider this example:No employee in a department may earn more than 25% more than median of the salaries in the department.    Seems like a rule that should be very easy to implement, doesn&#x27;t it? If we&#x27;re smart, we can implement that as a single database query and be done with it. But for the purpose of the discussion we will assume that we can&#x27;t do that (perhaps the backend is really stupid, or we expect to use this rule as a stepping stone for more rules, or we just feel like it :-) ).    So, what is the problem with this rule? The problem is the context in which you run it. The department manager may need to run this before a raise can be given. The HR HQ would need to run it for the whole company, and you need to support it running anywhere in between. Beyond the issue of performance and efficency (you don&#x27;t want to validate the whole company just to figure out that your little piece of heaven is fine, right?) there is also the issue of security. I might not be allowed to access certain records. In certain environments, it would be impossible to execute such rules, since they would try to access information that you don&#x27;t have rights to see and will be blocked.    Now it&#x27;s not that simple.    You can re-create the rule for each level that you need it, perhaps by creating an abstract rule and inheriting from it for each level you need. The problem with that is that it&#x27;s not really elegant, in my opinion. You need to create the correct object at every place, and you need to create a new object if you need to support a new level:DivergenceOfSalaryInDepartment&#xA0;divergence&#xA0;=&#xA0;new&#xA0;DivergenceOfSalaryInDepartmentForWholeCorp(corp);    dviegence.Validate();    I was thinking about this all day and it finally hit me when I was driving (I sometimes do my best thinking away from computers). The issue is all about the context you&#x27;re executing the rule in. And if it&#x27;s all about the context, why not make the context an explicit part of our model? Instead of pulling the data directly from the database, the rule would have a context that would get it for it, filtering it so only the information for the current context will be returned.     The usage would look like this:DivergenceOfSalaryInDepartment&#xA0;divergence&#xA0;=&#xA0;new&#xA0;DivergenceOfSalaryInDepartment(&#xA0;new&#xA0;CorporationRuleContext(corp));    dviegence.Validate();    Now you can reuse the context from rule to rule, and you&#x27;ve got only one rule to maintain. Sure, it&#x27;s not a world shaking idea, but it a nice one, I think.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For me, the hardest part about software project is not quite the beginning, but what follows after. In the beginning, you need to work how&#xA0;to start the project, what&#xA0;is the environment you&#x27;re&#xA0;going to work&#xA0;with, what is the data access strategy is going to be, etc.&#xA0;    If you&#x27;re an Agile practitioner, you&#x27;re going to start out not knowing where you&#x27;ll go. It may lead you to and fro as you discover the architecture of your system.&#xA0;I really don&#x27;t like this part, since you&#x27;re working hard, producing a lot of things that you&#x27;ll need later, but you are still too early to get something meaningful going.     In my current project I started out by just mapping out my data acess strategy and implementing CRUD functionality for the basic building blocks. From there, you can start implementing most of the features of the system. But you can&#x27;t do its heart yet.     Some software systems are all about CRUD, takes Blogs for example. But most applications, while using CRUD heavily, need an extra spark to be useful. A payroll system is mostly about CRUD. You add a worker, add a salary, and that is about it (yes, gross over simplification, I know). The interesting part usually happen behind the scene, and has little to do with CRUD per se. I&#x27;m at this point right now, I&#x27;m mostly over the routine database access stuff, although there are some pitfalls that I still need to thread carefully by.    What I&#x27;ve to do now is to give the system its heart. That extra something that you can&#x27;t do in an Excel sheet, if you please :-). And that is the most frustrating part of the work as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I&#x27;m building blocks that will be useful at a later stage, but too many blocks are missing to get any real functionality. It&#x27;s a problem because you can&#x27;t really see what your efforts have given you. I find it maddening, and it&#x27;s going to be another week at least before I&#x27;ve enough functionality to start combining it in interesting ways.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;ve blogged&#xA;before about the problems that I&#x2019;ve found in Visual Studio 2005 Testing&#xA;Framework. Nevertheless, I tried to keep using it in a project where the advanced&#xA;testing features weren&#x2019;t needed. As I&#x2019;ve said, it has some really&#xA;nice UI, but the underlying engine just isn&#x2019;t ready for general use.&#xA;&#xA;Take for example the most recent hurdle: &#x201C;Test Run&#xA;deployment issue: The location of the file or directory &#x2018;E:\Project\Bin\Debug\NHibernate.dll&#x2019;&#xA;is not trusted&#x201D; I fuzzed with it for a couple of hours, trying to&#xA;convince it that it&#x2019;s all right to run this code. Just to clarify, E: is&#xA;a hard disk on the local system, and the CLR permissions are the same, meaning&#xA;FullTrust for anything from this computer. NHibernate.dll is also strongly&#xA;named, so it can&#x2019;t be that.&#xA;&#xA;I finally given up and moved back to trust NUnit, and I don&#x2019;t&#xA;think that I&#x2019;ll look back. I feel&#xA;a tremendous boost in speed (~30&#xA;seconds to ~5 seconds) when running the tests. I get easy way to run a single&#xA;test, just about perfect!&#xA;&#xA;I&#x2019;m running inside a VM, and VSTS is still not RTM, so&#xA;it may improve by that time, but I seriously doubt it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">NHibernate &amp; Hibernate has a really cool feature by which you can map two columns in a database to any arbitary object. The first column is the type of the the object you want to create, and the second is the id of the object you want to create. Unsurprisingly, this feature is called &lt;any&gt; / &lt;many-to-any&gt;. It&#x27;s recommended that you wouldn&#x27;t use it since it&#x27;s not very OO, but sometimes there isn&#x27;t much choice.     I run into such a situation recently. I&#x27;ve a set of rules that can be applied to all sorts of objects. Thus, I need to use &lt;any&gt; and &lt;many-to-any&gt;. The &lt;any&gt; feature is relatively easy to understand, and I&#x27;d it implemented and (probably) working in a couple of hours. But allows me to repreduce in full the documentation there is for the &lt;many-to-any&gt; and the &lt;index-many-to-any&gt; in Hibernate (the mother project, the one with all the documentation).    &#xA0;The &lt;many-to-any&gt; and &lt;index-many-to-any&gt; elements provide for true heterogeneous associations. These mapping elements work in the same way as the &lt;any&gt; element - and should also be used rarely, if ever.     They really don&#x27;t want you to use it, appernatly. No worries, I thought, I&#x27;ll just go to Hibernate In Action and get the information from there.    Buzz! Wrong! Go sit in the corner!    No mention of anything useful about it (but tons of other useful stuff, of course). I&#x27;m reduced to reading XML Schemas and DTD, trying to understand what is going on.    I&#x27;ll post again when I&#x27;ve the answer. I asked in the forum and got an answer from Sergey (the lead developer of NHibernate), so I hope to get real info before I&#x27;ve to start debugging NHiberante again.    If someone who reads this ever used this feature in NHibernate or Hibernate, I would love to hear from you. I just don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s supposed to work, and the results I&#x27;m getting from prodding in the dark are painful.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The reason that I created NQA is that I wanted to understand how NHibernate did its magic. I was rathered surprised when people started&#xA0;using it to work with NHibernate on a regular basis. I added some schema editing features that people asked for them.    I then turned to greener pastures, ActiveRecord, namely. I recently got into situations where it can&#x27;t go. (Really weird schemas, etc). After I stopped feeling betrayed (What do you mean, you only read 99% of my mind?) I sat down to code it. That was where NQA was really helpful. I know hbm (the mapping syntax for NHibernate), but it&#x27;s not a trivial syntax, with many hidden gotchas for the unwary.    I was able to point &amp; click and get the desired schema very quickly. I&#x27;m very proud of it. :-)</p>

It&#x27;s about an orphaned magician and the things that he has to go through. As per regulations, Lackey produced a really good story, not so much in epic proportions this time, but it has all the elements that you need to make a really great reading. It has adventure and humor and romance and fun. We get to see characters from old and meet new interesting people. Highly recommened.    Interestingly, it took me a very long time to read them (I started on 14th of&#xA0;July, and ended last week). That was the reading overload I was suffering from, apperantly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The Fairy Godmother is the latest book by Mercedes Lackey that I read. It&#x27;s very different from her other works. It&#x27;s a different world, with different rules. And the rules of the game are fairy tales. In this world the very reality tries to make everything into a fairy tale. And it doesn&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a happy or a sad story.    Like all of Lackey&#x27;s works, it&#x27;s a complete world, and you get the feeling that there is a background to the story, not a thin coat of paint. It&#x27;s not really a story about a certain event, but a peek into the life of a Godmother from the time she was an Appertnice up until the time when she faces her greatest challange.    It&#x27;s not Valdemar, but it&#x27;s very good.</p>
