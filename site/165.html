            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB 5.0 will come out with support for time series. I talked about this briefly in the past, and now we are the point where we are almost ready for the feature to stand on its own. Before we get to that point, I have a few questions before the design is set. Here is what a typical query is going to look like:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.&#xA;      Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;              Show hidden characters&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          declare timeseries daily_heartrate(doc) {&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;            from doc.Heartrate between &#x27;2018-01-01&#x27; and &#x27;2019-01-01&#x27;&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;            group by 1d&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;            select min(), max(), avg()&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          }&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          from Users as u&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          where id(u) == &#x27;users/oren&#x27;&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          select daily_heartrate(u) as DailyHeartrate, u.Name&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          ts1.sql&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;We intend to make the queries as obvious as possible, so I&#x2019;m not going to explain it. If you can&#x2019;t figure out what the query above is meant to do, I would like to know, though.What sort of queries would you look to do with the data? For example, here is something that we expect users to want to do, compare and contrast different time periods, which you&#x2019;ll be able to do with the following manner:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.&#xA;      Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;              Show hidden characters&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          declare timeseries daily_heartrate(doc, $start, $end) {&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;            from doc.Heartrate between $start and $end&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;            group by 1d&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;            select min(), max(), avg()&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          }&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          from Users as u&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          where id(u) == &#x27;users/oren&#x27;&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          load daily_heartrate(u, &#x27;2019-09-01&#x27;, &#x27;2019-10-01&#x27;) as previous,&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;               daily_heartrate(u, &#x27;2019-10-01&#x27;, &#x27;2019-11-01&#x27;) as current&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          select previous as Previous, current as Current, timeseries.diff(current, previous) as Diff, u.Name&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          ts2.sql&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;The output of this query will give you the daily summaries for the last two months, as well as a time based diff between the two (meaning that it will match on the same dates, ignoring missing values, etc). What other methods for the &#x201C;timeseries.*&#x201D; would you need? The other factor that we want to get feedback on is what sort of visualization do you want to see on top of this data in the RavenDB Studio?</p>

Either a value does not compare equal to itself, or one value repeatedly compared to another value yields different results.The nasty thing about this is that if we had just 16 items in the array, this code would work. So this would appear to successfully work most times, and then break.The underlying issue is that Array.Sort will use different sorting algorithms based on the size of the array to be sorted. Under 16 items, it&#x2019;ll use an insertion sort, but over that, an introspection sort will be used (up to a limit, and then heap sort. Go read the code.).What is key here is that our comparison function is broken. It doesn&#x2019;t understand that two values can be equal. Because of that, comparing two equal values result in both of them being smaller than one another. That cause an error, and .NET issues this error. When you know what went wrong, the fix is pretty easy:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Following my posts about search, I wanted to narrow my focus a bit and look into the details of implementing a persistent data structure inside Voron.Voron is RavenDB&#x2019;s storage engine and forms the lowest layers of RavenDB. It is responsible for speed, safety, transactions and much more. It is also a very low level piece of code, which has a lot of impact on the design and implementation.Some of the things that we worry about when worrying Voron code are:Performance &#x2013; reduce computation / allocations (ideally to zero) for writes.Zero copies &#x2013; no cost for reads.Safety &#x2013; concurrent transactions can operate without interfering with one another.Applicability &#x2013; we tend to implement low level features that enable us to do a lot more on the higher tiers of the code.Scale &#x2013; handling data that may be very large, millions and billions of results.In this case, I want to look into what it would take to implement a persistent set. If I was working in memory, I would be using Set&lt;Int64&gt;, but when using a persistent data structure, things are more interesting. The set we use will simply record Int64 values. This is important for a bunch of reasons. First, Int64 is big, such values are used as file pointers, artificial ids, etc. Even though it seems limiting, we can get a lot more functionality than expected. Second, if we are using a set of Int64, we can implement that using a bitmap. A set value indicate that the value is in the set, which allows us to do set union, intersection and exclusion cheaply. The only problem here is that a bitmap with Int64 values is&#x2026; a problem. Imagine that I have the following code:set.Add(82_100_447_308);We would need to use 76GB(!) of memory to hold a bitmap for this set. That is obviously not going to be a workable solution for us. Luckily, there are other alternatives. Roaring Bitmaps are efficient in both time and space, so that is great. We just need to have an implementation that can work with a persistent model.In order to understand how I&#x2019;m going to go about implementing this feature, you need to understand how Voron is built. Voron is composed of several layers, the paging layer, which managed transactions and ACID and the data structure layer, which managed B&#x2B;Trees, tables, etc.In this case, we are implementing something at the data structure layer. And the first hurdle to jump through is decide how the data should look like. On the fact of it, this is a fairly simple decision, most of the decisions has already been made and outline in the previous post. We are going to have a sorted array of segment metadata, which will host individual segments with the set bits. This works if we have a single set, but in our case, we expect lots.If we are going to use this for storing the posting lists, we have to deal with the following scenarios (talking about the specific documents matching the terms in the index):Many such lists that have a single item (unique id, date, etc)Lots of lists that have just a few values (Customer&#x2019;s field in an order, for example)Few lists that have many values ( OrderCompleted: true, for example, can be safely expected to be about 99% of the total results) Many lists that have moderate amount of values (Each of the Tags options , for example)That means that we have to think very carefully about each scenario. The third and forth options are relatively similar and can probably be best served by the roaring bitmap that we discussed. But what about the first two?To answer that, we need to compute the metadata required to maintain the roaring set. At a minimum, we are going to have one SegmentMetadata involved, but we&#x2019;ll also need an offset for that segment&#x2019;s data, so that means that the minimum size involved has got to be 16 bytes (SegmentMetadata is 8 bytes, and a file offset is the same). There is also some overhead to store these values, which is 4 bytes each. So to store a single value using roaring set we&#x2019;ll need:16 bytes for the segment metadata and actual segment&#x2019;s offset4 bytes storage metadata for the previous line&#x2019;s data2 bytes (single short value) to mark the single flipped bit4 bytes storage metadata for the segment itselfIn short, we are getting to 26 bytes overhead if we just stored everything as a roaring set. Instead of doing that, we are going to try to do better and optimize as much as possible the first two options (unique id and very few matches). We&#x2019;ll set a limit of 28 bytes (which, together with the 4 bytes storage metadata will round up to nice 32 bytes). Up to that limit, we&#x2019;ll simple store the document ids we have as delta encoded varint.Let&#x2019;s say that we need to store the following document id lists:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;List&#xA;Encoding&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;[12394]&#xA;[234, 96]&#xA;[319333, 340981,342812][229, 190, 19, 144, 169, 1, 167, 14]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; You can see that the first list, which is 8 bytes in size, we encoded using merely 2 bytes. The second list, composed of three 8 bytes values (24 bytes) was encoded to merely 8 bytes. Without delta encoding, that value would be decoded to: [229, 190, 19, 245, 231, 20, 156, 246, 20], an additional byte. This is because we substract from each number the previous one, hopefully allowing to pack the value in a much more compact manner.With a size limit of 28 bytes, we can pack quite a few ids in the list. In my experiments, I could pack up to 20 document ids (so 160 bytes, without encoding) into that space with realistic scenario. Of course, we may get a bad pattern, but that would simply mean that we have to build the roaring set itself. I&#x2019;m going to go ahead and do just that, and then write a post about the interesting tidbits of the code that I&#x2019;ll encounter along the way.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into the following Reddit&#x2019;s question: My client&#x27;s business sounds shady. Should I run away? And I thought it was very interesting. Here are the relevant details:I have a client who wants me to finish developing a web application for him. Basically, his application has 2 types of users, buyers and sellers. The buyers can create an account and upload money to the website which goes into my clients bank account. The amount of money they have to spend is then logged in the database as their &quot;available funds&quot;. The users can then purchase services from the sellers.The sellers, when they sell a product, earn some of the funds from the buyers. So no money actually gets transferred. The database just updates to say that the buyer now has x$ less available, and the seller has an extra x$ available.Eventually the seller can withdraw their money, at which point my client transfers it from his bank.The core of the issue is in a comment:Their funds that they have available is just represented as a number in a database, which himself and the developers have access to. If one wanted to, they could just log into the database, create their own seller account, load it up with funds, then withdraw from my clients bank account. Just one example.There are a few interesting things here that I want to touch, but this question was posted to a legal advice community, so I should probably preface anything I say with the fact that I&#x2019;m not a lawyer, merely doing professional software development for quite some time and have dealt numerous times with financial systems and projects. Today, except for the money that you physically carry in your wallet or stuffed under a mattress, pretty much all money is represented as numbers in some database. And there have been cases where this have been used for theft. However, it is very rarely going to be something as obvious as merely changing numbers around in a database.For example, let&#x2019;s imagine that, as the admin of the website web application above, I follow the doomsday scenario and create my own seller account. At this point, I don&#x2019;t need to move money around, I can just put 10,000,000 in the Amount field and ask for a withdrawal. It will likely work, after all. There is no need to balance the numbers. Of course, this assumes quite a few things:There is no governance on the outgoing money. I don&#x2019;t care what would happen after.The fun thing about money transfers in the real world is that for the most part, they are reversible. I once paid a supplier, but I hit an extra 0 and didn&#x2019;t notice that until I hit the Submit key. I called the bank and cancelled the order. Another time, I switched numbers in a wire transfer and sent money to the wrote account. It took a couple of months before we discovered the issue, but we were able to reconcile everything. It was annoying, but not too hard.The threat model here is also fairly strange. We have someone that is able to modify the data directly in the database, but can&#x2019;t also call: SendMoney(me, all) ? All of the reasons above are partly why no real financial system works in this manner. There is no single Amount field per customer and money being shuffled off between accounts using &#x2B; or &#x2013;. Instead, you always have a record of transactions.You might have heard about the embezzlement by fraction, right?&#xA0; A programmer will direct the remainder of the result (typically partial cents) to their own account. Why do we need such a thing? After all, if the programmer is already able to write code that would move money around, why just deal with fractional cents? The answer is that in every financial institution, you are going to have some sort of governance. You&#x2019;ll run a query / report and the total amount of money in and the total amount of money out should match. If it doesn&#x2019;t, you have a Big Problem and are going to have to do something about it.&#xA0; This is why all these systems work based on moving money around and not creating it out of thin air. Money transfers are easily tracked, monitored and carefully audited. Doing the sort of thing that was suggested in the Reddit question falls under: Embezzlement, Theft, Money Laundering, Tax Evasion and probably a host of other laws. It isn&#x2019;t some weird trick that you can get away with.Regardless, unless the system you build is intentionally meant to evade the law, I doubt that the developers building the system would have any issues. The people operating it, of course, need to be sure that they are operating within the law, but that shouldn&#x2019;t be an issue for the developers. After all, a photo sharing website is a perfectly innocent project, but can be used for several nefarious and illegal purposes. But if someone took Lychee to put up a site for a pig named Napoleon hosted on eu-west-3 (Paris), I doubt that would put the Lychee project in any legal trouble.The title of this post promised that I would talk about data modeling, so let&#x2019;s get to it, shall we? If you are still worried about the shadiness of your client, and assuming that you aren&#x2019;t worried about the possibility of the shady client not paying you, what can you do?The answer is simple, don&#x2019;t have anything like an Amount field in the system. Don&#x2019;t allow it to happen. Instead, build the system using the notion of monetary transactions. That is, every movement of money between accounts (deposit from outside, withdrawal or shifting balance between accounts) must be explicit recorded as such.Here is a very simple example:You can see the movement of the money, and the total amount that was deducted from the source account matches the deposit &#x2B; commission. With RavenDB, you can use a Map/Reduce index on top of this set of transactions to compute:How much money does each account has.That the total amount of money in the system balances out.Note that in this case, the numbers that you are working on are computed, there is no way to just move things around. Instead, you have to do that using an actual transaction, which will create a traceable record. To make things more robust, you can take things further. Make sure that on each transaction, you&#x2019;ll email all the clients involved. That will ensure that there is an external record of the transactions in the system, and they can recover their own account state independently.&#xA0; This will protect the customer in the case of the shady client trying to do things behind their back. They have their own separate record of all the going on in their account, separate from what is store on the potentially vulnerable database. These are fairly routine behaviors for most financial systems, and I can&#x2019;t imagine a client not wanting them. They&#x2019;ll also serve as a pretty good protection for the developers if there is shadiness involved.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was pointed to this blog post which talks about the experience of using RavenDB in production. I want to start by saying that I love getting such feedback from our users, for a whole lot of reasons, not the least of which is that it is great to hear what people are doing with our database.Alex has been using RavenDB for a while, so he had the chance to use RavenDB 3.5 and 4.2, that is a good from my perspective, because means that he had the chance to see what the changes were and see how they impacted his routine usage of RavenDB. I&#x2019;m going to call out (and discuss) some of the points that Alex raise in the post. Speaking about .NET integration:Raven&#x2019;s .NET client API trumps MongoDB .NET Driver, CosmosDB &#x2B; Cosmonaut bundle and leaves smaller players like Cassandra (with DataStax C# Driver), CouchDB (with MyCouch) completely out of the competition.When I wrote RavenDB 0.x, way before the 1.0 release, it took two months to build the core engine, and another three months to build the .NET client. Most of that time went on Linq integration, by the way. Yes, it literally took more time to build the client than the database core. We put a lot of effort into that. I was involved for years in the NHibernate project and I took a lot of lessons from there. I&#x2019;m very happy that it shows.Speaking about technical support:RavenDB has a great technical support on Google Groups for no costs. All questions, regardless of the obtained license, get meaningful answers within 24 hours and quite often Oren Eini responds personally.Contrary to the Google Groups, questions on StackOverflow are often neglected. It&#x2019;s a mystery why Raven sticks to a such archaic style of tech support and hasn&#x2019;t migrated to StackOverflow or GitHub.I care quite deeply about the quality of our support, to the point where I&#x2019;ll often field questions directly, as Alex notes. I have an article on Linked In that talks about my philosophy in that regard which may be of interest. As to Alex&#x2019;s point about Stack Overflow vs Google Groups, the key difference is the way we can discuss things. In Stack Overflow, the focus is on an answer, but that isn&#x2019;t our usual workflow when providing support. Here is a question that would fit Stack Overflow very well, there is a well defined problem with all the details and we are able to provide an acceptable answer in a single exchange. That kind of interaction, on the other hand, is quite rare. It is a lot more common to have to have a lot more back and forth and we tend to try to give a complete solution, not just answer the initial question.Another issue is that Stack Overflow isn&#x2019;t moderated by us, which means that we would be subject to rules that we don&#x2019;t necessarily want to adhere to. For example, we get asked similar questions all the time, which are marked as duplicated and closed on Stack Overflow, but we want to actually answer people.&#xA0; GitHub issues are a good option for this kind of discussion, but they tend to cause people to raise issues, and one of the reasons that we have the google group is to create discussion. I guess it comes down to the different community that spring up from the communication medium.Speaking about documentation:RavenDB does have the official docs, which are easily navigable and searchable. Works well for beginners and provides good samples to start with, but there are gaps here and there, and it has far less coverage of the functionality than many popular free and open source projects.&#x2026;Ultimately, as a developer, I want to google my question and it&#x2019;s acceptable to have the answer on a non-official website. But if you&#x2019;re having a deep dive with RavenDB, it&#x2019;s unlikely to find it in the official docs, nor StackOverflow, nor GitHub.Documentation has always been a chore for me. The problem is that I know what the software does, so it can be hard to even figure out what we need to explain. This year we have hired a couple more technical writers specifically to address the missing pieces in our documentation. I think we are doing quite well at this point.What wasn&#x2019;t available at the time of this post and is available now is the book. All of the details about RavenDB that you could care too and more are detailed there are are available. It is also available to Google, so in many cases your Google search will point you to the right section in the book that may answer your question.I hope that these actions covered the gaps that Alex noted in our documentation. And there is also this blog, of course .Speaking about issues that he had run into:It&#x2019;s reliable and does work well. Unless it doesn&#x2019;t. And then a fix gets promptly released (a nightly build could be available within 24 hours after reporting the issue). And it works well again.&#x2026;All these bugs (and others I found) have been promptly fixed.&#x2026; stability of the server and the database integrity are sacred. Even a slight risk of losing it can keep you awake at night. So no, it&#x2019;s a biggy, unless the RavenDB team convinces me otherwise.I didn&#x2019;t include the list of issues that Alex pointed to on purpose. The actual issues don&#x2019;t matter that much, because he is correct, from Alex&#x2019;s perspective, RavenDB aught to Just Work, and anything else is our problem.We spend a lot of time on ensuring a high quality for RavenDB. I had a two parts with Jeffery Palermo about just that, and you might be interested in this keynote that goes into some of the challenges that are involved in making RavenDB.One of the issues that he raised was RavenDB crashing (or causing Windows to crash) because of a bug in the Windows Kernel that was deployed in a hotfix. The hotfix was quietly patched some time later by Microsoft, but in the meantime, RavenDB would crash.&#xA0; And a user would blame us, because we crashed. Another issue (RavenDB upgrade failing) was an intentional choice by us in the upgrade, however. We had a bug that can cause data corruption in some cases, we fixed it, but we had to deal with potentially problematic state of existing databases. We chose to be conservative and ask the user to take an explicit action in this case, to prevent data loss. It isn&#x2019;t ideal, I&#x2019;m afraid, but I believe that we have done the best that we could after fixing the underlying issue. In doubt, we pretty much always have to fall on the prevent data loss vs. availability side.Speaking about Linq &amp; JS support:let me give you a sense of how often you&#x2019;ll see LINQ queries throwing NotSupportedException in runtime.&#x2026;But in front of us a special case &#x2014; a database written in the .NET! There is no need in converting a query to SQL or JavaScript.I believe that I mentioned already that the initial Linq support for RavenDB literally took more time than building RavenDB itself, right? Linq is an awesome feature, for the consumer. For the provider, it is a mess. I&#x2019;m going to quote Frans Bouma on this:Something every developer of an ORM with a LINQ provider has found out: with a LINQ provider you&#x27;re never done. There are always issues popping up due to e.g. unexpected expressions in the tree.Now, as Alex points out. RavenDB is written in .NET, so we could technically use something like Serialize.Linq and support any arbitrary expression easily, right?Not really, I&#x2019;m afraid, and for quite a few reasons:Security &#x2013; you are effectively allowing a user to send arbitrary code to be executed on the server. That is never going to end up well. Compatibility &#x2013; we want to make sure that we are able to change our internals freely. If we are forced to accept (and then execute) code from the client, that freedom is limited.Performance &#x2013; issuing a query in this manners means that we&#x2019;ll have to evaluate the query on each document in the relevant collection. A full table scan. That is not a feature that RavenDB even has, and for a very good reason.Limited to .NET only &#x2013; we currently have client for .NET, JVM, Go, Python, C&#x2B;&#x2B; and Node.JS. Having features just for one client is not something that we want, it really complicates our lives. We think about queries using RQL, which are abstract in nature and don&#x2019;t tie us down with regards to how we implement them. That means that we can use features such as automatic indexes, build fast queries, etc. Speaking about RQL:Alex points out some issues with RQL as well. The first issue relates to the difference between a field existing and having a null value. RavenDB make a distinction between these state. A field can have a null value or it can have a missing value. In a similar way to the behavior of NULL in SQL, which can often create similar confusion. The problem with RavenDB is that the schema itself isn&#x2019;t required, so different documents can have different fields, so in our case, there is an additional level. A field can have a value, be null or not exist. And we reflect that in our queries. Unfortunately, while the behavior is well defined and documented, just like NULL behavior in SQL, it can be surprising to users.&#xA0; Another issue that Alex brings up is that negation queries aren&#x2019;t supported directly. This is because of the way we process queries and one of the ways we ensure that users are aware of the impact of the query. With negation query, we have to first match all documents the exclude all those that match the negation. For large number of documents, that can be expensive. Ideally, the user have a way to limit the scope of the matches that are being negated, which can really help performance.Speaking about safe by default:RavenDB is a lot less opinionated than it used to be. Alex rightfully points that out. As we got more users, we had to expand what you could do with RavenDB.&#xA0; It still pains me to see people do things that are going to be problematic in the end (extremely large page sizes are one good example), but our users demanded that. To quote Alex:I&#x2019;d preferred a slowed performance in production and a warning in the server logs rather than a runtime exception.Our issue with this approach is that no one looks at the logs and that this usually come to a head at 2 AM, resulting in a support call from the ops team about a piece of software that broke. Because of this, we have removed many such features, while turning them to alerts, and the very few that remained (mostly just the number of requests per session) can be controlled globally by the admin directly from the Studio. This ensures that the ops team can do something if you hit the wall, and of course, you can also configure this from the client side globally easily enough.As a craftsman, it pains me to remove those limits, but I have to admit that it significantly reduced the number of support calls that we had to deal with. Conclusion:Overall, I can say RavenDB is a very good NoSQL database for .NET developers, but the &#x201D;good&#x201D; is coming with a bunch of caveats. I&#x2019;m confident in my ability to develop any enterprise application with RavenDB applying the Domain-driven design (DDD) philosophy and practices.I think that this is really the best one could hope for. I think that Alex&#x2019;s review that is honest and to the point. Moreover, it is focused and detailed. That make very valuable. Because he got to his conclusions not out of brief tour of RavenDB but actually holding it up in the trenches.Thanks, Alex.</p>
