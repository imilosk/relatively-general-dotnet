            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most frustrating things when you dealing with production issues is when the problem is not in our product, but elsewhere. In particular, this post is dedicated to the hard work done by many anti virus products, in particular, to make our life harder. Let us take a look at the following quote, taken from the ESET NOD32 Anti Virus knowledge base (emphasis mine):  By default, your ESET product automatically detects programs that are used as web browsers and email clients, and adds them to the list of programs that the internal proxy scans. This can cause loss of internet connectivity or other undesired results with applications that use network features but are not web browsers/email clients. Yes, it can. In fact, it very often does.  Previously, we looked at a similar issue with Anti Virus slowing down I/O enough to cause us to slowly die. But in this case, the issue is a lot more subtle. Because it is doing content filtering, it tends to put a much higher overhead on the system resources, which means that as far as the user is concerned, RavenDB is slow. We actually developed features specifically to handle this scenario. The traffic watch mode will tell you how much time you spend on the server side, and we have added a feature that will make RavenDB account for the internal work each query is doing, so we can tell where the actual cost is. You can enable that by issuing:  GET databases/Northwind/debug/enable-query-timing And one that is setup, you can get a good idea about what is costly in the query, as far as RavenDB is concerned. Here is an example of a very slow query:   You can see that the issue is that we are issuing a very wide range query, so most of the time is spent in inside Lucene. Other examples might be ridicilously complex queries, which result in high parsing time (we have seen queries in the hundreds of KB range). Or loading a lot of big documents, or&#x2026; you get the drift. If we see that the server thinks that a query is fast, but the overall time is slow, we know to blame the network. But an even more insidious issue is that this would drop requests,&#xA0; consistently and randomly (and yes, I know that those are contradictions, it was consistently dropping requests in a random pattern that seemed explicitly designed to thwart figuring out what is going on). Leading to things breaking, and escalated support calls. &#x201C;RavenDB is broken&#x201D; leads to a lot of headache, and a burning desire to hit something when you figure out that not only isn&#x2019;t it your fault, but the underlying reason is actively trying to prevent you from figuring it out (I assume it is to deal with viruses that try to shut it off), which lead to really complex find facting sessions. That is more annoying because it seems that the issue there was a bug in respecting keep alive sessions for authenticated requests under some scenarios, in the AV product in question! Absolutely not fun!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As you can imagine, I&#x2019;m really interested in what is going on with storage engines. So when I read the RocksDB Tuning Guide with interest. Actually, mounting horror was more like it, to be frank. It all culminated pretty nicely with the final quote:  Unfortunately, configuring RocksDB optimally is not trivial. Even we as RocksDB developers don&#x27;t fully understand the effect of each configuration change. If you want to fully optimize RocksDB for your workload, we recommend experiments&#x2026; Um&#x2026; okaaaay. That is pretty scary statement. Now, to be fair, RocksDB is supposed to be a low level embedded storage engine, it isn&#x2019;t meant to be something that is directly exposed to the user or operations people. And yet&#x2026; I&#x2019;m literally writing databases for a living, and I had a hard time following all the options they had there. And it appears that from the final thought that the developers of RocksDB are also at a loss here. It is a very problematic state to be in. Because optimizations and knowing how to get the whole thing working is a pretty important part of using a database engine. And if your optimizations process relies on &#x201C;change a bunch of settings&#x201D;, and see what happens, that is not kind at all. Remember, RocksDB is actually based on LevelDB, which is a database which was designed to be the backend of IndexdDB, which runs in the browser and has a single threaded client and a single user, pretty much. LevelDB can do a lot more than that, but that was the primary design goal, at least initially.  The problems with LevelDB are pretty well known, it suffers from write amplification, as well as known to hang if there is a compaction going on, and&#x2026; well, you can read on that elsewhere. RocksDB was supposed to take LevelDB and improve on all the issues that LevelDB had. But it appears that most of what was done was to actually create more configuration options (yes, I&#x2019;m well aware that this is an unfair statement, but it sure seems so from the tuning guide). What is bad here is that the number of options is very high, and the burden it puts on the implementers is pretty high. Basically, it is a &#x201C;change &amp; pray&#x201D; mindset. Another thing that bugs me is the number of &#x201C;mutex bottlenecks&#x201D; that are mentioned in the tuning guide, with the suggestions to shard things to resolve them. Now, to be fair, an embedded database require a bit of expertise, and cooperation from the host process, but that seems to be pushing it. It is possible that this is only required for the very high end usage, but that is still not fun. Compared to that, Voron has about 15 configuration options, most of them about controlling the default sizes we use. And pretty much all of them are set to be auto tuned on the fly. Voron on its on actually have very few moving parts, which makes reasoning about it much simpler and efficient.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The final monitoring feature in RavenDB 3.5 is SNMP support. For those of you who aren&#x2019;t aware, SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It is used primarily for monitoring network services. And with RavenDB 3.5, we have full support for it. We even registered our own root OID for all RavenDB work (1.3.6.1.4.1.45751, if anyone cares at this stage). We have also setup a test server where you can look at the result on SNMP support in RavenDB 3.5 (login as guest to see details). But what is this about?  Basically, a lot of monitoring features that we looked at boiled down to re-implementing enterprise monitoring tools that are already out there. Using SNMP gives all those tools direct access to the internal details of RavenDB, and allow you to plot and manage them using your favorite monitoring tools. From Zabbix to OpenView to MS MOM. We expose a long list of metrics, from the loaded databases to the number of indexes items per second to the ingest rate to the number of queries to how much storage space each database takes to&#x2026; Well, you can just go ahead and read the whole list and go over it.  We are still going to put effort into making figuring out what is going on with RavenDB directly from the studio, but as customers start running large numbers of RavenDB instances, it becomes unpractical to deal with each of them individually. That is why using a monitoring system that can watch many servers is preferable. You can also set it up to send alerts when certain threshold is reached, and&#x2026; those are now features that aren&#x2019;t RavenDB features, those are your monitoring system features.  Being able to just off load all of those features is great, because we can just expose the values to the monitoring tools and go on to focus on other stuff, rather than just have to do the full monitoring work, UI, configuration, alerts, etc.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB 3.5 have just a few of major monitoring features (although wait for the next one, it is a biggie), but this one is a pretty important one. This feature allows RavenDB to track, at a very detailed level, all the I/O work that is done by the server, and give you accurate information about what exactly is going on with the system. Take a look at this report:  As you can see, you see a one minute usage, with writes going on and some indexing work along the way.  The idea here is that you can narrow down any bottlenecks that you have in the system. Not only by looking at the raw I/O stats that the OS provides, but actually be able to narrow it down to a particular database and a particular action inside that database. For users with multi tenants databases, this can be a very useful tool in figuring out what is actually going on in their system. The mechanics behind this report are actually interesting. We are using ETW to capture the I/O rates, but since we are capturing kernel events, that require admin privileges. Typically, RavenDB isn&#x2019;t run with those privileges. To work around that, the admin is going to run the Raven.Monitor.exe process, in an elevated context. That gives us access to the kernel events, and we then process the information and show them to the user in the studio.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I introduced RavenDB Collection Specific Replication. This allows you to filter which collections you&#x2019;ll get to replicate.  The next step is to apply filters and transformers along the way. For example, like so:   As you can see, the transformation script allows us to modify the outgoing data, in this case, to hide the email address. This feature is primarily intended for data replication back to staging / development environment, where you have the need to have the data, but can&#x2019;t expose some of it outside.  It can also be used to modify details going to slave databases so we&#x2019;ll have per database values (for example, striping details that are not relevant for a particular tenant). Like Collection Specific Replication, this replication destination will not be considered to be a failover target.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">With RavenDB 3.5, we added a really cool feature to the RavenDB Replication. Actually, I&#x2019;m not sure how much of a &#x201C;feature&#x201D; this is, because this actually take away capabilities .  As the name suggest, this allows you to select specific collections and only replicate those to a specific destination. For example, in this example, we can see that we are only replicating the Categories, Companies and Employees collection, instead of replicating the entire database.   Why is this important?  Because it opens up new ways of managing your data. It allows you to use RavenDB replication (high throughput, reliable and error resilient) to manage data distribution. Let us imagine for a moment that we have a web ordering system, with multiple tenants. And we have some common information that needs to be shared among all the tenants. For example, the baseline pricing information. We can setup replication like so:  The Shared database contains a lot of information, but only the pricing information is replicated. This means that you can change it once, and it will propagate to all the end destinations on its own. Common scenarios for such shared data include:  Users /logins Base data for local modifications (product catalog that each tenant can override) Rules Note that because we are using collection specific replication, this does not make the destination database into a duplicate of the source. As such, it will not take part in failover configuration for the source database. You can mix and match, a single database can replicate to failover destination (full replication) and partial (only specific collections). And the clients will know how to fail to the right node if something bad happens.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the hardest practices to learn as a developer is to actually sit down and read the information that you have. Ever since we became a product company, we have to deal with partial information, because some data wasn&#x2019;t captured, or it isn&#x2019;t possible to capture more information because it is running in a production environment. That means that we have to do the most with the information we have available. Here are a few recent cases of having information, and ignoring it. A customer complained that a query was timing out.

I&#x2019;m actually quite proud of this, even though the error is obtuse, it is giving us all the information that we need to figure out what the problem is.&#xA;In particular, there are two pieces of information that we need to see here:&#xA;&#xA;OperationCancelledException is thrown when we have a timeout processing the query on the server side. &#xA;start=9134999 is a request to do deep paging of about 10 million records, and then start reading. &#xA;Those two combine tell us that the issue is that we are doing deep paging, which cause us to timeout internally before we start sending any data.&#xA;But why are we timing out on deep paging? What is expensive about that?&#xA;Turns out that RavenDB does de-dup during queries. So if you got events/1 in page #1, you won&#x2019;t see it in page #2 even if there are results from the index for that document in page #2. If you care to know more, the issue is related to fanout and one document having many index entries pointing to it. But the major issue here is that we need to scan 10 million docs to avoid duplicates before we can return any value to the user. There is a flag you can send that would avoid this, but that wasn&#x2019;t used in this case.&#xA;Another issue that was solved by reading the message from the customer was:&#xA;Message&#xA;Version store out of memory (cleanup already attempted)&#xA; &#xA;Exception&#xA;Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.EsentVersionStoreOutOfMemoryException: Version store out of memory (cleanup already attempted) at Raven.Database.Storage.Esent.StorageActions.DocumentStorageActions.RemoveAllBefore(String name, Etag etag) in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Database\Storage\Esent\StorageActions\Lists.cs:line 74 at Raven.Database.Smuggler.SmugglerEmbeddedDatabaseOperations.&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass12.&lt;PurgeTombstones&gt;b__11(IStorageActionsAccessor accessor) in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Database\Smuggler\SmugglerEmbeddedDatabaseOperations.cs:line 219 at Raven.Storage.Esent.TransactionalStorage.ExecuteBatch(Action`1 action, EsentTransactionContext transactionContext) in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Database\Storage\Esent\TransactionalStorage.cs:line 799 at Raven.Storage.Esent.TransactionalStorage.Batch(Action`1 action) in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Database\Storage\Esent\TransactionalStorage.cs:line 778 at Raven.Abstractions.Smuggler.SmugglerDatabaseApiBase.&lt;ExportData&gt;d__2.MoveNext() in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Abstractions\Smuggler\SmugglerDatabaseApiBase.cs:line 187 --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown --- at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task) at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)Reported&#xA;25 minutes ago (08/02/15, 9:43am)&#xA;Level&#xA;Error&#xA;Version store out of memory happens when the size of the uncommitted transaction is too large, and we error. Usually that indicate some unbounded operation that wasn&#x2019;t handled well.&#xA;Those are almost always batch operations of some kind that do various typed of cleanups. In order to handle them, we are pulsing the transaction. Effectively committing the transaction and starting a new one. That frees the uncommitted values.&#xA;The problem was that this method had this behavior:&#xA;&#xA;So the investigation was focused on why MaybePulseTransaction didn&#x2019;t work properly. There is some heuristics there to avoid being too costly, so it was very strange.&#xA;Can you see the error? We were looking at the wrong overload, this is the one that takes a time, and the one that was called takes an etag. Indeed, in the version the customer had, that call wasn&#x2019;t there. In the current version, it was added.&#xA;Knowing how to read errors and logs, and actually paying attention to what they are saying is crucial when the time to fix a problem is at hand.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note, this is something that we are considering for 4.0. RavenDB uses JSON natively to handle pretty much everything. Which makes sense, for a JSON Document Database. JSON is easy to parse, human readable and for the most part, have no real complexity associated with it. However, while JSON is easy to parse, there is some computational overhead around parsing it. In fact, in our perf testing, we spend quite a lot of time just serializing and deserialzing JSON. It is one of the major costs we have to deal with, mostly because that is something that happens all the time. We have previous used BSON to store documents internally, but profiling has actually shown that it is cheaper to hold the data as JSON text and parse it. So that is what we are currently doing.  However, even faster parsing is still parsing, and something that we would like to avoid. There is also an issue with how this is actually represented in memory. Let us consider the following JSON: {&quot;FirstName&quot;:&quot;John&quot;,&quot;LastName&quot;:&quot;Smith&quot;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;In memory, this is represented as (highly simplified):&#xA;&#xA;Dictionary&lt;string,object&gt; instance&#xA;&#xA;string[] for the keys&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;FirstName&#x201D; string&#xA;&#x201C;LastName&#x201D; string&#xA;object[] for the values&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;John&#x201D; string&#xA;&#x201C;Smith&#x201D; string&#xA;In other words, especially for large documents, there are a lot of small objects that are being created. That doesn&#x2019;t impact immediate parsing cost, but those do need to be collected after the fact, and that is something that we would like to avoid.&#xA;We are currently considering using Flat Buffers for internal document storage. The good thing about Flat Buffers is that there is not intermediate parsing step. You get a block of memory that you can immediately access. That has two major advantages, loading the documents to memory would mean just reading a buffer from disk, with no extra cost. But it would also mean that the act of releasing a document would be much cheaper, we would only need to collect the buffer again, not potentially tens of thousands of small objects.&#xA;Another advantage is that we usually need to load documents to be indexed, and usually indexing only require very few fields from the documents. By avoiding the cost of parsing, only paying the price for the objects that we are actually touching, we are in a much better position to reduce the indexing costs.&#xA;A rough scratch schema using flat buffers would be:&#xA;union AnyValueUnion { Document, Array, Value }&#xA;&#xA;table AnyValue&#xA;{&#xA;    Value: AnyValueUnion;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Value&#xA;{&#xA;    Type: byte;&#xA;    String: string;&#xA;    Bytes: [byte];&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Array&#xA;{&#xA;    Values: [AnyValue];&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table FieldValue &#xA;{&#xA;    Name: string;&#xA;    Value: AnyValue;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Document&#xA;{&#xA;    Values: [FieldValue];    &#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The Values inside the documents are sorted by field name, so we can search a field using binary search. &#xA;&#xA;Nitpicker corner: Yes, we probably would want to use a hash here, but this is a rough draft to test things out, it will come later.&#xA;We need to optimize the schema, and using it will not be a lot of fun, but the speed and memory improvements should be significant.&#xA;Another alternative would be a schema such as this:&#xA;table FieldValue &#xA;{&#xA;    Name: int;&#xA;    Value: AnyValue;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Document&#xA;{&#xA;    Values: [FieldValue];    &#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Root&#xA;{&#xA;    Fields: [string];&#xA;    Document: Document;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Here we store all the field names once, then we refer to the field name using its index in the root object. This should have the advantage of reducing repeated string names.</p>
