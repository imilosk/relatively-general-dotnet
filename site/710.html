            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rob Conery&#xA0;asks how the MS MVC platform should handle XSS attacks. In general, I feel that frameworks should do their best&#xA0;to ensure that&#xA0;to be secure by default. This means that I feel that by default, you should encode everything that comes from the user to the app. People seems to think that encoding inbound data will litter your DB with encoded text that isn&#x2019;t searchable and consumable by other applications. &#xA;That may be the case, but consider, what exactly is getting encoded? Assuming that this is not a field that require rich text editing, what are we likely to have there? &#xA;Text, normal text, text that can roundtrip through HTML encoding without modifications.&#xA;HTML style text in most of those form fields are actually rare. And if you need to have some form of control over it, you can always handle the decoding yourself. Safe by default is a good approach. In fact, I have a project that uses just this approach, and it is working wonderfully well.&#xA;Another approach for that would be to make outputting HTML encoded strings very easy. In fact, it should be so easy that it would be the default approach for output strings.&#xA;Here, the &lt;%= %&gt; syntax fails. It translate directly to Response.Write(), which means that you have to take an extra step to get secured output. I would suggest changing, for MS MVC, the output of &lt;%= %&gt; to output HTML encoded strings, and provide a secondary way to output raw text to the user.&#xA;In MonoRail, Damien Guard&#xA0;has been responsible for pushing us in this direction. He had pointed out several places where MonoRail was not secure by default. As a direct result of Damien&#x27;s suggestions, Brail has gotten the !{post.Author} syntax, which does HTML encoding. This is now considered the best practice for output data, as well as my own default approach.&#xA;Due to backward comparability reasons, I kept the following syntax valid: ${post.Author}, mainly because it is useful for doing things like output HTML directly, such as in: ${Form.HiddenField(&quot;user.id&quot;)}. For the same reason, we cannot automatically encode everything by default, which is controversial, but very useful.&#xA;Regardless, having a very easy way ( !{post.Author} ) to do things in a secure fashion is a plus. I would strongly suggest that the MS MVC team would do the same. Not a &quot;best practice&quot;, not &quot;suggested usage&quot;, simply force it by default (and allow easy way out when needed).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been getting a lot of questions about how I make the diagrams for the blog. I got some very strange suggestions from people, from having a full blown art department dedicated to producing those to drawing the diagrams on physical paper and then taking pictures of that on a wooden table. The truth is far more boring, I am afraid. I generally use the following tools to produce the diagrams:  Google Image Search Power Point MS Paint Visual Studio I use visual studio&#x27;s class diagram designer to create the class diagrams, usually from empty projects, not the real ones. Then I copy the image to power point, where I do some mixing &amp; matching.  Power Point is really nice in this regard, because it offers a rich set of effects that even a graphical dummy like me can use effectively. I use Google Image Search to find relevant images, and then drag them into Power Point as well, making the same style of effects there. Then, if needed, I move it to MS Paint for final processing, and from there, to the blog. This approach works well for someone that needs three tries to draw a straight line using a ruler, it is also something that doesn&#x27;t take very long, which is also important.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, this issue cause some head scratching today. We are using WIndsor&#x27;s Automatic Transaction Management with NHibernate&#x27;s flush-on-commit option, so if a transaction doesn&#x27;t commit, nothing is written to the database. Anyway, this is a story about refactoring, and what it showed us. We performed the following refactoring:   Some things that is important to understand, the LoginController is decorated with [Transactional], and there is a [Transaction] attribute on CreateUserLoggedInAuditRecord. When it was on the controller, it just worked. When we moved it to its own class, it didn&#x27;t work. To be rather more exact, it worked, it just never committed the transaction. That was weird. After some head scratching I found out that I forgot to put [Transactional] on the UsageRegistrationImpl. With a small smile of geeky&#xA0; triumph, I run the code again. It didn&#x27;t save. That was really worrying, and I had no idea what was going on. Since this is rarely popular, I repeatedly run the code, hoping that something would turn up and that no one would pull the old quote about insanity. After a few repetitions, I suddenly saw the light.   It had to do where I placed the pointcut. A pointcut, in AOP terms, is where the AOP can interfere with the running code. Let us take a look at how it worked when we used the LoginController directly. Because we (well, the transaction facility) asked the container to create an interceptor for it, we got the following classes at runtime:   The login controller is the original class, the login controller proxy was generated at runtime, and any invocation of any of its methods would fire the transaction interceptor, so it would get a chance to create/rollback/commit a transaction if needed. Since those methods are virtual, this means that even if I am calling methods on the same class, they will be intercepted correctly. Now, when I moved to the interface &#x2B; implementing class, we have a different behavior. Now, we use the interface pointcuts in order to inject behavior, it looks like this:   Windsor will create a proxy interface implementation that would call the AOP interceptors and will forward to the UsageRegistrationImpl. The problem was with the RegisterUserLoggedIn method. It was similar to this: public virtual void RegisterUserLoggedIn(string username)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;// do other things&#xA;&#x9;CreateUserLoggedInAuditRecord(username);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;[Transaction]&#xA;public virtual void CreateUserLoggedInAuditRecord(string username)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;//do database stuff&#xA;}&#xA;Given the story so far, you can obviously see the problem. When we call the CreateUserLoggedInAuditRecord() method, we call it from the UsageRegistrationImpl class, so we never pass through any of the pointcuts.&#xA;When we used the method from the controller directly, we made a virtual method call, which was intercepted, but since in this case, we were using the interface as our pointcut, this simply by passed the whole thing.&#xA;That was an interesting lesson, and one that I&#x27;ll need to remember for the future.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Daniel has a very interesting post&#xA0;about how mocking can works in C# 3.0 (I don&#x27;t like the term Linq for Mock, if you haven&#x27;t noticed). I wonder if he has used Rhino Mocks, from the description of mock frameworks in the post, it looks like he didn&#x27;t. At any rate, the syntax that he has there if quite interesting: var mock = new Mock&lt;IFoo&gt;();mock.Expect(x =&gt; x.DoInt(It.Is&lt;int&gt;(i =&gt; i % 2 == 0))).Returns(1);&#xA;The use of lambda as a way to specify expectations is cool, and as a way to specify constraints, flat out amazing.&#xA;You can do most of that with Rhino Mocks right now, I feel forced to point out.&#xA;IFoo foo = mocks.DynamicMock&lt;IFoo&gt;();&#xA;Expect.Call( () =&gt; foo.DoInt(0) )&#xA;&#x9;.Callback( (int i) =&gt; i % 2 == 0 )&#xA;&#x9;.Return(1);&#xA;We even have an Is.Matching constraint, that we can use instead:&#xA;Expect.Call( () =&gt; foo.DoInt(0) )&#xA;&#x9;.Constraints( Is.Matching&lt;int&gt;( i =&gt; i % 2 == 0) )&#xA;&#x9;.Return(1);&#xA;I guess we will just need to see what kind of cool stuff we still have in store for it. &#xA;Great job, Daniel.&#xA;I suggest that you would check this out. The Quick Start&#xA0;gives few more examples, and it is looking really nice.&#xA;By the way, for the horde of people who would like to &quot;port&quot; those examples to Rhino Mocks, we have a wiki... :-)</p>

This is not something that I was very happy with because I feel that Rhino Igloo represents a compromise that I am not very happy with. Consider this the product of a developer longing for MonoRail while having to deal with WebForms world. I am not making excuses for this project, it is meant to serve&#xA0;a very specific goal, and it has done that very successfully.It is also extremely opinionated and may not fit what you want to do.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I really like the CLR. It is a great platform, it has a rich set of libraries, it has a lot of power and flexibility, and it was designed with multi language support in mind, which means that what you can do on the CLR vs. what you can do in your language are two different things.  It is just too bad that the default CLR language is C#. Now, that probably raised a few brows, and definitely some hackles. C# is a great language, I can hear you saying. Well, yes, sort of. If you thinks that holding the compiler&#x2019;s hands is a useful thing to do.&#xA0;Leaving aside the ability to extend the compiler, Boo has the following to offer us:  Syntactic sugar for common programming patterns - List, hash and array literals, object initialization, string formatting and regular expression matching are all first class concepts in Boo, with direct support for all of them in a natural manner.  Automatic Variable Declaration together with Automatic type inference &#x2013; the compiler takes care of things for you, instead of having to type the same thing over and over and over again. Some would say that this is bad, for them I would reply that they should try it first. It works.Take a look at this:  def random():&#xA;&#x9;return 4 # selected by dice roll, guaranteed to be random&#xA;val = random() &#xA;&#xA;Is there are reason that I would need to specify the type over and over again? The compiler can figure it out for itself and not bother you with it. If you want to get a compiler error, you can: &#xA;val as string = random() # will error about type mismatch &#xA;&#xA;Automatic type casting &#x2013; don&#x2019;t make me explicitly say it, figure it out for me. I&#x2019;ll have unit tests to check to cover me. &#xA;Duck typing &#x2013; Boo is a strongly typed language, but you can ask the compiler to relax those constraints at certain scenarios. It makes some things much more natural, especially since you have a way to get into this infrastructure and decide what to do at runtime. If we will take a simple example, let us look at the XmlObject and what we can do with it: &#xA;person = XmlObject(xmlDocument)&#xA;print person.FirstName&#xA;print person.LastName &#xA;&#xA;What we just did was resolve, at runtime, that we were asked to get the value of a property called &#x201C;FirstName&#x201D;, and we did. This is a trivial piece of code to implement. &#xA;Just those benefits present a significant improvement in the language experience, and we haven&#x2019;t even touched the extensible compiler yet.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, what is this Boo language anyway? I am talking about it fairly often, but I never explained, and I am going to assume that people aren&#x27;t following links :-)  Boo is an object oriented, statically typed language for the common language runtime with a Python inspired syntax and focused on language and compiler extensibility.  Boo is an Open Source project, released under the BSD license. This means that you are free to take, modify and use the language and its products in any way you want, without any limitation[1] .&#xA0;Rodrigo B. de Oliveira started the project, and since then grown in popularity. The project is active and continually evolving. At the time of the writing, the released version of Boo is 0.8. However, Boo seems to be following the trend of many open source projects, in that that it is not really rushing toward 1.0 release. Boo has been around for a number of years, and I have been using it for production for the last two years.  Production, in this case, means systems that move money around with my neck on the line. I have a high degree of trust in it, obviously. Beyond being a really malleable language, suitable for DSL. Boo is also a nice language to work with for day-to-day tasks. The SharpDevelop IDE project has support for Boo, so you get the usual benefits. There is an ongoing project to support Boo in Visual Studio, and I have an active interest in seeing support for that being established. I don&#x27;t much care for which IDE, but I want a standard, checklist driven way of getting a language running. Here is a secret, I tend to think and write in Boo, translating down to C# because I have to. Boo is a far more flexible language, and the ability to reprogram the compiler makes tedious tasks in other languages an amusing challenge. Those same tedious problems are usually overcome, to some degree, by throwing code generation at the problem until it goes away.  In Boo, we would usually tell the compiler how we want to handle this, and let the compiler take over from there. This is similar to code generation, except that this is done at the compiler level, which means that we have far more knowledge about what is going on. For example, let us say that we want to implement the singleton pattern. We need to do quite a bit of work to make it happen. Ensure that creating the singleton is thread safe, lazy initialization, make all the constructors private, ensure that serializable singleton remain singleton through serialization/deserialization, create static Instance property, have no static members on the singleton class. To do this in most language we would have to follow an implementation pattern and write fairly repetitive code. In Boo, we can capture this usage pattern in an AstAttribute (more on that later) that will do all of that for us, at the cost of a single attribute declaration. Similar capabilities allow correct usage of disposable, observable, and more advance techniques such as aspect oriented programming.  Some of the capabilities that Boo has can be had using IL Weaving tools such as PostSharp. The problem with those is that using them is something that happens after compilation. As a simple example, you would not be able to create a singleton in this manner, because you would not be able to generate the Instance property at the appropriate time.  Assuming that you want to use the singleton in the same assembly as it was defined, you will not be able to reference the Instance property, it will not exist until the post compile step has run. Boo, however, does this at compile time, so by the time the compiler get to the point where it is resolving the property, it has already been added.  In short, I really like the language and what it allows me to do.     [1] Well, if you are interested in creating a new language called Ba, you probably would want to make it clear where the project ancestry came from&#x2026;</p>
