            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Not all of our testing happened in a production settings. One of our test clusters was simply running a pretty simple loop of writes, reads and queries on all the nodes in the cluster while intentionally destabilizing the system.After about a week of this we learned that this worked, there were no memory leaks or increased resource usage and also that the size of the data on disk was about three orders of magnitude too much. Investigating this we discovered that the test process introduced conflicts because it wrote the same set of documents to each of the nodes, repeatedly. We are resolving this automatically but are also keeping the conflicted copies around so users can figure out what happened to their system. In this particular scenario, we had a lot of conflicted revisions, and it was hard initially to figure out what took that space. In our production system, we also discovered that we log too much. One of the interesting feedback items we were looking for in this production test run is to see what kind of information we can get from the logs and make sure that the details there are actionable. A part of that was to see if we could troubleshoot something simply using the logs, and add missing details if there were stuff that we couldn&#x2019;t figure out from them.We also discovered that under load, we would log a lot. In particular, we had logs detailed every indexed document and replicated item. These are almost never useful, but they generate a lot of noise when we lowered the log settings. So that went away as well. We are very focused on logs usability, it should be possible to understand what is going on and why without drowning in minutia.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Before stamping RavenDB with the RTM marker, we decided that we wanted to push it to our production systems. That is something that we have been doing for quite a while, obviously, dogfooding our own infrastructure. But this time was different. While before we had a pretty simple deployment and stable pace, this time we decided to mix things up.In other words, we decided to go ahead with the IT version of the stooges, for our production systems. In particular, that means this blog, the internal systems that run our business, all our websites, external services that are exposed to customers, etc. As I&#x2019;m writing this, one of the nodes in our cluster has run out of disk space, it has been doing that since last week. Another node has been torn down and rebuilt at least twice during this run. We also did a few times of &#x201C;it is compiles, it fits production&#x201D;. In other words, we basically read this guy&#x2019;s twitter stream and did what he said. This resulted in an infinite loop in production on two nodes and that issue was handled by someone who didn&#x2019;t know what the problem was, wasn&#x2019;t part of the change that cause it and was able to figure it out, and then had to workaround it with no code changes.We also had two different things upgrade their (interdependent) systems at the same time, which included both upgrading the software and adding new features. I also had two guys with the ability to manage machines, and a whole brigade of people who were uploading things to production. That meant that we had distinct lack of knowledge across the board, so the people managing the machines weren&#x2019;t always aware that the system was experiencing and the people deploying software weren&#x2019;t aware of the actual state of the system. At some points I&#x2019;m pretty sure that we had two concurrent (and opposing) rolling upgrades to the database servers.No, I didn&#x2019;t spike my coffee with anything but extra sugar. This mess of a production deployment was quite carefully planned. I&#x2019;ll admit that I wanted to do that a few months earlier, but it looks like my shipment of additional time was delayed in the mail, so we do what we can.We need to support this software for a minimum of five years, likely longer, that means that we really need to see where all the potholes are and patch them as best we can. This means that we need to test it on bad situations. And there is only so much that a chaos monkey can do. I don&#x2019;t want to see what happens when the network failed. That is quite easily enough to simulate and certainly something that we are thinking about. But being able to diagnose a live production system with a infinite loop because of bad error handling and recover that. That is the kind of stuff that I want to know that we can do in order to properly support things in production.And while we had a few glitches, but for the most part, I don&#x2019;t think that any one that was really observed externally. The reason for that is the reliability mechanisms in RavenDB 4.0, we need just a single server to remain functional, for the most part, which meant that we can just run without issue even if most of the cluster was flat out broken for an extended period of time.We got a lot of really interesting results for this experience, I&#x2019;ll be posting about some of them in the near future. I don&#x2019;t think that I recommend doing that for any customers, but the problem is that we have seen systems that are managed about as poorly, and we want to be able to survive in such (hostile) environment and also be able to support customers that have partial or even misleading ideas about what their own systems look like and behave.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Recently I had a need to test our SSL/TLS infrastructure. RavenDB is making heavy use of SSL/TLS and I was trying to see if I could get it to do the wrong thing. In order to do that, I needed to make strange TLS connections. In particular, the kind of things that would violate the spec and hopefully cause the server to behave in a Bad Way. The problem is that in order to do that, beyond the first couple of messages, you need to handle the whole encryption portion of the TLS stack. That is not fun. I asked around, and it looks like the best way to do that is to start with an existing codebase and break it. For example, get OpenSSL and modify it to generate sort of the right response. But getting OpenSSL compiling and working is a non trivial task, especially because I&#x2019;m not familiar with the codebase and it is complex.I tried that for a while, and then despaired and looked at the abyss. And the abyss looked back, and there was JavaScript. More to the point, there was this project.&#xA0; Forge is a Node.JS implementation of TLS from the ground up. I&#x2019;m not sure why it exists, but it does. It is also quite easy to follow up and read the code, and it meant that I could spend 10 minutes and have a debuggable TLS implementation that I could hack without any issues in VS Code. I liked that.I also heard good things about the Go TLS client in this regard, but this was easier. This was a good reminder for me to look further than the obvious solution. Oh, and I tested things and it my hunch that the server would die was false, it handled things properly, so that was a whole lot of excitement over nothing.</p>

This is partly why it is not a project but a gist, because it is just to share what we have done with others, not to take it upon ourselves to build a full blown client.I have to say that I like the V2 protocol much better, is seems much more intuitive to use and easier to work with. I particularly liked the fact that I can resume working on an order after a while, which means that failure modes such as failing to propagate a DNS update can now be much more easily recoverable. It also means that trying to run the same order twice for some reason doesn&#x2019;t generate a new order, but resume the existing one, which is quite nice, given the rate limits imposed by Let&#x2019;s Encrypt. Note that the code is also making assumptions, such as caching details for you behind the scenes and not bother with other parts of the API that are not important for our needs (modifying an account or revoking a certificate).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">About a decade ago I remember getting a call from a customer that was very upset with RavenDB. They just deployed to production a brand new system, they were ready for high load so they wen with a 32 GB and 16 cores system (which was a lot at the time). The gist of the issue, RavenDB was using 15% of the CPU and about 3 GB on RAM to serve requests. When I inquired further about how fast it was doing that I got a grudging &#x201C;a millisecond or three, not more&#x201D;. I ended the call wondering if I should add a thread that would do nothing but allocate memory and compute primes. That was a long time ago, since the idea of having a thread do crypto mining didn&#x2019;t occur to me .This is a funny story, but it shows a real problem. Users really want you to be able to make full use of their system, and one of the design goals for RavenDB has been to do just that. This means making use of as much memory as we can and as much CPU as we need. We did that with an eye toward common production machines, with many GB of memory and cores to spare.And then came Docker, and suddenly it was the age of the 512MB machine with a single core all over again. That cause&#x2026; issues for us. In particular, our usual configuration is meant for a much stronger machine, so we now need to also deploy separate configuration for lower end machines. Luckily for us, we were always planning on running on low end hardware, for POS and embedded scenarios, but it is funny to see the resurgence of the small machine in production again.</p>
