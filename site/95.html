            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I want to talk about an aspect of RavenDB that is usually ignored. Its pricing structure. The model we use for pricing RavenDB is pretty simple, we charge on a per core basis, with two tiers depending on what features you want exactly. The details and the actual numbers can be found here. We recently had a potential customer contact us about doing a new project with RavenDB. They had a bunch of questions to us about technical details that pertain to their usage scenario. They also asked a lot of questions about licensing. That is pretty normal and something that we field on a daily basis, nothing to write a blog post about.&#xA0; So why am I writing this?&#xA;For licensing, we pointed to the buy page and that was it. We sometimes need to clarify what we mean exactly by &#x201C;core&#x201D; and occasionally the customer will ask us about more specialized scenarios (such as massive deployments, running on multiple purpose hardware, etc). The customer in question was quite surprised by the interaction. The contact person for us was one of the sales people, and they got all the information in the first couple of emails from us (we needed some clarification about what exactly their scenario was).&#xA;It turned out that this customer was considering using MongoDB for their solution, but they have had a very different interaction with them. I was interested enough in this to ask them for a timeline of the events.&#xA;It took three and a half months from initial contact until the customer actually had a number that they could work with.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Day&#xA;Event&#xA;Result&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1&#xA;Login to MongoDB Atlas, use the chat feature to ask for pricing for running a MongoDB cluster in an on-premise configuration&#xA;Got an email address to send in MongoDB to discuss this issue&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1&#xA;Email to Sales Development Representative to explain about the project and the required needs. Ask for pricing information.&#xA;The representative suggests to keep using Atlas on the cloud, propose a phone call.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;30 minutes call with Sales Development Representative. Representative is pushing hard to remain on Atlas in cloud instead of on-premise solution.&#xA;After insisting that only on-premise solution is viable for project, representative asks to get current scenarios and projected growth, MongoDB will&#xA0; generate a quote based on those numbers.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;6&#xA;After researching various growth scenarios, sending an email with the details to the representative.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;37&#xA;Enough time has passed with no reply from MongoDB. Asking for status of our inquiry and ETA for the quote.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;65&#xA;After multiple emails, managed to setup another call with the representative (same one as before). Another 30 minutes call.&#xA;The representative cannot locate previous detailed scenario, pushed to using Atlas cloud option again. The Sales Development Representative pulls a Corporate Account Executive to email conversation. A new meeting is scheduled.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;72&#xA;Meeting with Corporate Account Executive, explain the scenario again (3rd time).&#xA;Being pressured to use the cloud option on Atlas. Setting up a call with MongoDB&#x27;s Solution Architect.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;80&#xA;Before meeting with Solution Architect, another meeting by request of Corporate Account Executive.&#xA;Tried to convince to use Atlas again, need to explain why this needs to be an on-premise solution.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;87&#xA;Meeting with Solution Architect, presenting the proposed solution (again).&#xA;Had to explain (yes, again) why this is an on-premise solution and cannot use Atlas. Solution Architect sends a script to run to verify various numbers on test project MongoDB instance.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;94&#xA;Seven days since all requested details were sent, requested quote again, asked if something is still missing and whether can finally get the quote.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;101&#xA;Got the quote!&#xA;Fairly hard to figure out from the quote what exactly the final number would be, asking a question.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;102&#xA;Got an answer explaining how to interpret the numbers that were sent to us.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;To repeat that again. From having a scenario to having a quote (or even just a guesstimate pricing) took over 100 days! It also took five different meetings with various MongoDB representatives (and having to keep explaining the same thing many times over) to get a number.&#xA;During that timeframe, the customer is not sure yet whether the technology stack that they are considering is going to be viable for their scenario. During that time frame, they can&#x2019;t really proceed (since the cost may be prohibitive for their scenario) and are stuck in a place of uncertainty and doubt about their choices.&#xA;For reference, the time frame from a customer asking about RavenDB for the first time and when they have at least a fairly good idea about what kind of expense we are talking about is measured in hours. Admittedly, sometimes it would be 96 hours (because of weekends, usually), but the idea that it can take so long to actually get a dollar value for a customer is absolutely insane.&#xA;Quite aside from any technical differences between the products, the fact that you have all the information upfront with RavenDB turns out to be a major advantage. For that matter, for most scenarios, customers don&#x2019;t have to talk to us, they can do everything on their own.&#xA;The best customer service, in my opinion, is to not have to go through that. For the majority of the cases, you can do everything on your own. Some customers would need more details and reach out, in which case the only sensible thing is to actually make it easy for them.&#xA;We have had cases where we closed the loop (got the details from the customer, sent a quote and the quote was accepted) before competitors even respond to the first email. This isn&#x2019;t as technically exciting as a new algorithm or a major performance improvement, but it has a serious and real impact on the acceptance of the product.&#xA;Oh, and as a final factor, it turns out that we are the more cost efficient option, by a lot.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">NewsBlur (a personal news aggregator) suffered from a data breech / ransomware &#x201C;attack&#x201D;. I&#x2019;m using the term &#x201C;attack&#x201D; here in quotes because this is the equivalent to having your car broken into after you left it with the engine running with the keys inside in a bad part of town.As a result of the breech, users&#x2019; data including personal RSS feeds, access tokens for social media, email addresses and other sundry items of various import. It looks like about 250GB of data was taken hostage, by the way.The explanation about what exactly happened is really interesting, however.NewsBlur moved their MongoDB instance from its own server to a container. Along the way, they accidently (looks like a Docker default configuration) opened the MongoDB port to the whole wide world. By default, MongoDB will only listen to the localhost, in this case, I think that from the perspective of MongoDB, it was listening to the local port, it is Docker infrastructure that did the port forwarding and tied the public port to the instance. From that point on, it was just a matter of time. It apparently took two hours or so for some automated script to run into the welcome mat and jump in, wreak havoc and move on.I&#x2019;m actually surprised that it took so long. In some cases, machines are attacked in under a minute from showing up on the public internet. I used the term bad part of town earlier, but it is more accurate to say that the entire internet is a hostile environment and should be threated as such.That lead to the next problem. You should never assume that you are running in anywhere else. In the case above, we have NewsBlur assuming that they are running on a private network where only the internal servers can access. About a year ago, Microsoft had a similar issue, they exposed an Elastic cluster that was supposed to be on an internal network only and lost 250 million customer support records. In both cases, the problem was lack of defense in depth. Once the attacker was able to connect to the system, it was game over. There are monitoring solutions that you can use, but in general, the idea is that you don&#x2019;t trust your network. You authenticate and encrypt all the traffic, regardless of where you are running it. The additional encryption cost is not usually meaningful for typical workloads (even for demanding workloads), given that most CPUs have dedicated encryption instructions. When using RavenDB, we have taken the steps to ensure that:It is simple and easy to run in a secure mode, using X509 client certificate for authentication and all network communications are encrypted.It is hard and complex to run without security. If you run the RavenDB setup wizard, it takes under two minutes to end up with a secured solution, one that you can expose to the outside world and not worry about your data taking a walk.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A RavenDB database can reside on multiple nodes in the cluster. RavenDB uses a multi master protocol to handle writes. Any node holding the database will be able to accept writes. This is in contrast to other databases that use the leader/follower model. In such systems, only a single instance is able to accept writes at any given point in time.&#xA;The node that accepted the write is responsible for disseminating the write to the rest of the cluster. This should work even if there are some breaks in communication, mind, which makes things more interesting.&#xA;Consider the case of a write to node A. Node A will accept the write and then replicate that as part of its normal operations to the other nodes in the cluster.&#xA;In other words, we&#x2019;ll have:&#xA;&#xA;A &#x2013;&gt; B&#xA;A &#x2013;&gt; C&#xA;A &#x2013;&gt; D&#xA;A &#x2013;&gt; E&#xA;&#xA;In a distributed system, we need to be prepare for all sort of strange failures. Consider the case where node A cannot talk to node C, but the other nodes can. In this scenario, we still expect node C to have the full data. Even if node A cannot send the data to it directly.&#xA;The simple solution would be to simply have each node replicate the data it get from any source to all its siblings. However, consider the cost involved?&#xA;&#xA;Write to node A (1KB document) will result in 4 replication (4KB)&#xA;Node B will replicate to 4 nodes (including A, mind), so that it another 4KB.&#xA;Node C will replicate to 4 nodes, so that it another 4KB.&#xA;Node D will replicate to 4 nodes, so that it another 4KB.&#xA;Node E will replicate to 4 nodes, so that it another 4KB.&#xA;&#xA;In other words, in a 5 nodes cluster, a single 1KB write will generate 20KB of network traffic, the vast majority of it totally unnecessary.&#xA;There are many gossip algorithms, and they are quite interesting, but they are usually not meant for a continuous stream of updates. They are focus on robustness over efficiency.&#xA;RavenDB takes the following approach, when a node accept a write from a client directly, it will send the new write to all its siblings immediately. However, if a node accept a write from replication, the situation is different. We assume that the node that replicate the document to us will also replicate the document to other nodes in the cluster. As such, we&#x2019;ll not initiate replication immediately. What we&#x2019;ll do, instead, it let all the nodes that replicate to us, that we got the new document.&#xA;If we don&#x2019;t have any writes on the node, we&#x2019;ll check every 15 seconds whatever we have documents that aren&#x2019;t present on our siblings. Remember that the siblings will report to us what documents they currently have, proactively. There is no need to chat over the network about that.&#xA;In other words, during normal operations, what we&#x2019;ll have is node A replicating the document to all the other nodes. They&#x2019;ll each inform the other nodes that they have this document and nothing further needs to be done. However, in the case of a break between node A and node C, the other nodes will realize that they have a document that isn&#x2019;t on node C, in which case they&#x2019;ll complete the cycle and send it to node C, healing the gap in the network.&#xA;I&#x2019;m using the term &#x201C;tell the other nodes what documents we have&#x201D;, but that isn&#x2019;t what is actually going on. We use change vectors to track the replication state across the cluster. We don&#x2019;t need to send each individual document write to the other side, instead, we can send a single change vector (a short string) that will tell the other side all the documents that we have in one shot.&#xA0; You can read more about change vectors here.&#xA;In short, the behavior on the part of the node is simple:&#xA;&#xA;On document write to the node, replicate the document to all siblings immediately.&#xA;On document replication, notify all siblings about the new change vector.&#xA;Every 15 seconds, replicate to siblings the documents that they missed.&#xA;&#xA;Just these rules allow us to have a sophisticated system in practice, because we&#x2019;ll not have excessive writes over the network but we&#x2019;ll bypass any errors in the network layer without issue.</p>

It allows you to continue scrolling indefinitely. The method is often used in social media feeds or blogs.In this post, we&#x27;ll create a Blazor component that you can use like the following:Razorcopy&lt;Infini</p>
