            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am currently building a project that needs a permissions framework. The overall idea is that you have a user, an object and a set of permissions, and I need to verify whatever a user has or hasn&#x27;t the specified permission on the object.    Problems:            Permissions may be granted to a group, and a group may aggregate other groups.            Aggregates always has their own set of permissions, but&#xA0;some permissions are inherited to child objects, some do not.            Permission may be granted on a group of (unrelated) objects.            Need for deny permission.            It has to perform well for large amount of permission queries (I want to call it over set of objects returned from a query).    I considered AzMan, and it would be great, but as far as I know, it handles only roles, not permissions on objects, and while I could handle this using some sort of a naming convention, I would rather avoid it. Creating objects in Active Directory and using Windows Permissons on that is also not a good idea, most probably.    Any suggestions?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had a chat with a pal that works in a company that is slowly (and relucently) moving to .Net. They are moving slowly because they have existing Main-Frame based infrastructure, and they can&#x27;t figure out why it takes longer to develop an Ajax-Based ASP.Net application over the usual green screen terminals. We spent a lunch discussing the difference between the two styles of development. One is for a static environment, where each of the developers has 15&#x2B; years not only as a programmer, but in the business.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Udi is talking about some of the advantages of using spaces, tha&#xA0;ability to extend an existing infrastructure at runtime, simply by adding new clients and new tasks to a running grid/space. The idea is that there is an existing set of servers, which handles tasks from several queues. This separation of the servers that does the work from the clients that request is means that you can register new types of tasks and they will be handled automatically.     He also&#xA0;mentions a technological difference between Java and .Net. Apperantly, Jini on Java is capable of handling uknown types automatically, by downloading their byte code and dependencies. On the .Net side of things, we have no such facility built in, and if we would try to deserialize a task of an uknown type, we would get&#xA0;a serialization exception.    This difference pushed Udi to use a different style for this, instead of tasks that contains both behavior and data, use messages on the queue, and deploy message handlers to the servers. Personally, I like the zero deploy scenario, and I think that I like the idea of a task that encompass&#xA0;both data and behavior.    I have given to the issue of deploying some thought, and since we have strong versioning for .Net assemblies, it is really a matter of finding out what the assembly qualified name of the task is, and then go to a central server that has it if the server doesn&#x27;t have it already. A&#xA0;nice advantage of this scheme is that you get the ability to handle versioning of tasks pertty much out of the box.    One thing that I am not so sure of is separation of clients from the decision process. That is, while a client may want to start the SendOrder process, is it really the responsability of the client to put a SendOrderUsingFedExTask on the queue? This seems like too much responsability, so maybe using messages here is preferred. Again, you can request message hanlders automatically, so you still get that benefit.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It seems like a MonoRail implementation of the UpdatePanel is fairly high for people coming to MonoRail from the WebForms world. I am doing a project that uses Update Panel fairly extensively, and I can see why, it is really nice way to add Ajax capabilities to your web form. I started to look into what it would take to implement it with MonoRail, and I came to two conclusions:            The technical challanges on the server side are minor, on the client side it is more of an issue, but not hugely so.                 The default architecture for UI in MonoRail basically makes it a non applicable.    I guess that I should explain.     The Web Form architecture is constraining the page to mostly interact with the page using post backs. There is a whole mechanism at both client and server side that is used to make this happen, which is what the Update Panel plugs into. This means that programming concepts such as AutoPostBack=true are very common on the WebForms world, and a great deal of work is done on the same page.    MonoRail, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t place such constraints, and the default architecture for the UI is radically different. Instead of interacting mostly with the same page, mostly using postbacks, you tend to have a more relaxed model, where you usually talk to the controller, and that chooses one of several views to send your way.     When I say &quot;talking to the controller&quot;, I mean issuing requests to the application, most often, Ajax seems to be the choice for that, but moving between actions and views using POST/GET is fairly common as well. While you could build the views to work in the same manner as Web Forms, I have hard time thinkning about good reasons why you would want to do that.    So, I hope we can agree that the default architecture between the two is hugely different. Now, let us go back to the update panel request. While the mechanics may not be the same, it is fairly common to want to replace part of your page. And it wouldn&#x27;t be nice if MonoRail made it hard. Well, as it turn out, it doesn&#x27;t.    In my MonoRail web cast, I have shown how it can be done, you have a piece of the UI that you want to replace using Ajax. Let us take Fowler&#x27;s refactoring approach:            You decide that you want to update a part of the UI dynamically.                 You extract that part into a separate view (mostly involving Cut&amp;Paste)                 You call the new view from the old view                 You create a new method on the controller that would rendner the new view and return it.*                 On the UI, you create an Ajax.Updater element that would call the new method on the server (and automatically replace the part of the page with the returned result).    * There are several ways to do it, a new method is one, specifying different view for the same method is another, which I sometimes like more.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">About 6 years ago, I was a very yound soldier, serving as a warden at Prison 6, Company C. For those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with the inner details of Israel&#x27;s prisons, Prison 6 is a military prison for IDF soldiers. Reasons for getting to prison range from showing up with unshined boots to drug use to selling arms. Company C was where the more dangerous inmates where held. I didn&#x27;t get the people who forgot to shine their shoes, I got the drug dealers and stollen arms sellers.    Anyway, back to the story, I was (and am) a geek, probably a nice person, being thrown into that situation was very low on my &quot;Things To Do&quot; list. Nevertheless, the IDF, in his great wisdom, has decided to put me there, so I had to go. (Later, I was in a position when I had to make the same decision, that wisdom turned out to be purely arbitrary).    About three weeks after I arrived at the prison, I was at my Sergeant&#x27;s office, and he was busy flirting with the nurse that came to check on the inmates. It was about noon, which meant that it was time for the noon Count. Life in prison mostly revolve around those Counts, and they are held as sacred. I already had most of the inmates lined up outside the office, just waiting for the Sergeant to come out and count them.    As I said, he was busy flirting, and didn&#x27;t feel like doing it right then. So he told me to go out and keep them busy for a while. Keep in mind what the population was, and that I was just finished the introduction part, I had no idea what to do, and I told him so.    &quot;Oren, my boy,&quot; he told me, &quot;you are going to go out there, stand in front of the company, and talk for the next fifteen minutes. They are going to listen to you, and in 12:17, I am going to count them, am I clear?&quot; I protested that I had no idea what to talk about, and couldn&#x27;t do it anyway.    &quot;Oren,&quot; he said in a much milder voice, &quot;perhaps I wasn&#x27;t clear, you are going to go out there, and you are going to talk to them, talk to them about socks, if you like. If you don&#x27;t like it, be kind and take your place at cell 6&quot;.    I went out there, and talked for fifteen minutes, and to this day I have no idea about what, although I suspect that socks has been the topic under discussion at least part of the time. I never had any problem with speaking in public since and I admire this Sergeant to this day, very much so, and not only because of that.    DevTeach is in a few days, and I find myself missing my Sergeant again. I know the material, and I am not so much afraid about giving a talk in English, it is the ability to make it interesting that worries me. *Sigh*, I will go practice it some more now...</p>
