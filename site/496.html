            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I found a bug in Lucene.NET that resulted in a memory leak in RavenDB. Take a look here (I have simplified the code to some extent, but the same spirit remains):     public class CloseableThreadLocal&#xA;{&#xA;    [ThreadStatic] private static Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt; slots;&#xA;&#xA;    public static Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt; Slots&#xA;    {&#xA;        get { return slots ?? (slots = new Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt;()); }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public /*protected internal*/ virtual Object InitialValue()&#xA;    {&#xA;        return null;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public virtual Object Get()&#xA;    {&#xA;        object val;&#xA;&#xA;        if (Slots.TryGetValue(this, out val))&#xA;        {&#xA;            return val;&#xA;        }&#xA;        val = InitialValue();&#xA;        Set(val);&#xA;        return val;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public virtual void Set(object val)&#xA;    {&#xA;        Slots[this] = val;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public virtual void Close()&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (slots != null)// intentionally using the field here, to avoid creating the instance&#xA;            slots.Remove(this);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;As you can imagine, this is a fairly elegant way of doing this (please note, .NET 4.0 have the ThreadLocal class, which I strongly recommend using). But it has one very serious flaw. It you don&#x2019;t close the instance, you are going to leak some memory. As you can imagine, that is a pretty bad thing to do.&#xA;&#xA;In general, I consider such designs as pretty bad bugs when writing managed code. We have the GC for a reason, and writing code that forces the user to manually manage memory is BAD for you. Here is an example showing the problem:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  class Program&#xA;{&#xA;    static void Main(string[] args)&#xA;    {&#xA;        UseThreadLocal();&#xA;        GC.Collect(2);        GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();&#xA;        Console.WriteLine(CloseableThreadLocal.slots.Count);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    private static void UseThreadLocal()&#xA;    {&#xA;        var tl = new CloseableThreadLocal();&#xA;        tl.Set(&quot;hello there&quot;);&#xA;        Console.WriteLine(tl.Get());&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;This will show that after the UseThreadLocal() run and we force full collection, the value is still there.&#xA;&#xA;Without using the builtin ThreadLocal, can you figure out a way to solve this? &#xA;&#xA;Points goes to whoever does this with the minimum amount of changes to the code.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/15/2010What are the advantages that you get when using RavenDB? The easy answers are:     Sparse data    Dynamic data    Better scaling across nodes   But there is another one that is even more important, in my eyes. It is the simple issue that with RavenDB, a document is a transactional boundary. That makes it very easy to model interactions on root aggregates that are much harder in relational database.  The most commonly used example is Order &amp; OrderLines. In a relational database, those would be in two separate tables, and it is possible to modify order lines without touching the order. With RavenDB, on the other hand, the OrderLines are embedded in the Order document, so you literally cannot modify them without touching the order as well. This has a lot of implications. The most obvious one is that you just got rid of a big burden in terms of managing concurrency. You no longer have to be very careful about how you update parts of your model, as you have to be when using relational databases. You can just make any update you want, and if there are concurrent updates, it will completely, without you having to do anything at all.  Another benefit of this approach is that because a document is the transactional boundary, accessing all of it is a very cheap operation. Coming back again to the Order, it is a very cheap operation to access all of the Order details, which can be very costly in a relational database (having to access Orders, OrderLines, Addresses, etc&#x2026; ).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/13/2010A while ago my company started to offer Commercial Support for NHibernate. It seems like a complementary product to what we are already doing, but it actually had a few other reasons to want to do so.  Put simply, my pool of potential clients for the NHibernate Profiler are&#x2026; NHibernate users. Anything that increases the pool of NHibernate&#x2019;s users also increase the pool of potential clients for NH Prof.  The reason that we offer commercial support for NHibernate in the first place was to increase the trust people have with NHibernate. It reduce a barrier to entry, since if a company asks about the support options, they know that there are commercial support options out there.  With that in mind, I set out to design the pricing structure for the commercial support very carefully. One of the most important aspects of offering commercial support is that you want to have it behave just like insurance. For the most part, people need the support contract very rarely, and even if you end up spending three days working on a customer problem, that cost is amortized with other customers who did not call.  Knowing that, I explicitly added an Ad Hoc option for the commercial support offering for NHibernate. Ad Hoc support doesn&#x2019;t really make a lot of sense, to tell you the truth. Not as a product, at least. It basically means that someone can call you, pay a fixed amount and then require potentially unlimited amount of time / effort. The reason that I did that is that having an Ad Hoc support option is a very compelling feature from the customer point of view. For precisely the same reason.  I was looking to make NHibernate itself more attractive with that offer, not to actually have a viable product.   Now, however, I feel that NHibernate no longer need the prop of the Ad Hoc support option, and thus it is no longer an option for our commercial support offering for NHibernate.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/8/2010I posted the following a few days ago:     I&#x2019;ll be giving my Advanced NHibernate course in March 2011 in Dallas. We are talking about 3 days of intensive dive into NHibernate, how it works, fully utilizing its capabilities, and actually grokking the NHibernate&#x2019;s zen.    You can register to the course here: http://dallas-nhibernate.eventbee.com   And I got an very interesting comment about that:       You mention in your post that your having an advanced nhibernate course, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to agree with your syllabus which devotes 1/3 of the class to intro concepts.     Just thought I&#x27;d say this in hopes that the course could be more advanced in nature.   The answer is that the syllabus is correct, and the course is advanced. But how can I call a course advanced if it contains things like?     Basic NHibernate configuration    Getting started with queries and mapping    Session and transaction management basics    Simple NHibernate queries   Put simply, it is because most people, even thus who are using NHibernate for a&#xA0; while, barely scratch the surface of its capabilities. What we are doing in the course is going deep. We digs into how NHibernate is doing some things, why it does them in such a fashion and what alternative are theer.  Another very interesting thing that I noted with most people coming to my courses is that they may have a lot of knowledge in a particular area of NHibernate, but lack the same level of knowledge in other areas.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/6/2010I recently had a few discussions with several startups, in the process of going to the cloud. One of the first questions that I ask is &#x201C;what is your licensing/revue model?&#x201D;.  At first, I usually get some very funny looks, I am not there to do business consulting, but to do technical stuff. Why do I stick my nose into things that have absolutely nothing to do with technical stuff?  The answer is quite simple, you have to consider the money side of things in your architecture. Let me give you a real world example. A startup that I was talking with was talking about creating a SAAS system on the cloud. Each client would pay&#xA0; a flat fee of 150$ per month. When I started talking with them, the idea was to use EC2&#x2019;s ability to just create a new node on the fly, and give each client their own server. That would allow very easy development and deployment, and remove a whole bunch of complexity.  I even agreed, except that I raised one small problem. Each server would cost them roughly 250$ per month. I had to ask them: &#x201C;Do you intend to make it up in volume?&#x201D;  We always had to make those sort of calls, but especially when we are using the cloud it becomes so much clearer. We have to take into account the actual real world costs of our architecture choices, and in many cases, we have to adapt our practices to the actual economical realities.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/6/2010That is actually an inaccurate statement, for the most part. A more accurate way of saying this is that for the most part, you don&#x2019;t need to think about scaling a multi tenant environment. Most multi tenant environments are using some form of a user based licensing method, which means that for the vast majority of tenants, there aren&#x2019;t going to be a lot of users. That means that we have a very natural way of isolating things. Handling a single tenant is very easy, then, because we are actually handling small amount of users and (relatively) small amount of information.  The challenge begins when we need to consider how to work with all the tenants. My general approach to that is actually to think upfront about the sort of things that would prevent me from scaling things, and avoid those, but not do anything else about it. Let us consider what I mean&#x2026;  The easiest way to handle multi tenant application is when you create total separation between each tenant. It is fairly easy to do, all you have to ensure is a separate data store (note that you really need to ensure separate caches, as well), and everything else more or less flows from there. In most multi tenant applications, there are four things that may vary between tenants:     Schema    Data    Behavior    User Interface   The first two are handled at the data store level (and is usually very easy), while the last two are just application code (be it separate dll, tenant scripts, configuration, etc).   Given all of that, scaling multi tenant applications is usually a process that is handled by the load balancer. What you need is to specify which tenants are served by which servers, and to ensure that you don&#x2019;t overload each server capacity. If you want to be really smart about it, you can do load based load balancing, but for the most part, even static routing that gives each server X number of tenants would work.  This helps a lot because it means that for the most part, even though you are writing a distributed app that may have a very large number of total users, your actual application can behave as if it was a small application. That means that you can do thinks like memory based caching, instead of distributed caching, because all the tenant users are going to be served from the same server.  And what happen if you have a tenant with thousands of users?  At that point, doing this sort of trick won&#x2019;t work, but presumably you are charging them enough to just allocate a single server for this tenant. In fact, assuming standard user based licensing, you actually got to the point where you have, as we say in Israel, a Rich Man&#x2019;s Problem. Even if they are big enough to require more than a single server, you can usually just split them to several, that is where the pre-planning for the scaling stoppers starts to pay. But in all honestly, it doesn&#x2019;t happen that often.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/5/2010&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;One question that comes up frequently with regards to running RavenDB on the cloud is how to take advantage of the cloud&#x2019;s ability to scale up &amp; down dynamically. The question to that is actually quite interesting.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You don&#x2019;t.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That seems to give most people a pause, because it is totally unexpected. On the cloud, people expects to be able to dynamically adjust the number of servers they have based on their current load. After all, this is what you do with web and worker roles, no?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The problem with that logic chain is that is assumes equality between a Database and a web/worker role. For the most part, web/worker roles are pretty much stateless, they may have caches, but that is about it. That makes it very easy to add new servers when there is heavy load and remove them when the load goes down.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But for data roles, you can&#x2019;t really do that. What is going to happen to the data in that node when you take it down when there is less work to be done?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;There are actually solutions for that, to tell you the truth, at least for RavenDB, because we can manipulate offline databases very easily, so we can shuffle them off &amp; on machines by just copying the document. But for the most part, it is actually too much work. Even for very large loads, a small number of sharded servers can more than keep up with your application, and while it is theoretically nice to have the ability to do so, you usually don&#x2019;t care.</p>
