            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got mentioned on Mini Microsoft, along with couple of others that had similar problems. The comments there are pretty interesting.    The official launch is tomorrow, so that means that anyone who is using 2005 RTM is a hard core guy, and they are the fellows that are passionate about it. They are the ones that are hurt by those bugs. Because you&#x27;re not supposed to find so many bugs in a product so fast. Some of those bugs will cause me to lose my work. That is unacceptable. What is going to happen when hundreds of thousands of developers move to VS 2005?    They will run into those bugs, and they will be furious when they will see that it is a known bug.    I know that Microsoft couldn&#x27;t probably delay the launch, since there are quite a few projects that depends on it. I would&#x27;ve solved it by giving the developers a beta 3 with Go Live license, and doing nothing but fixing the bugs in the product. Hell, I would have been perfectly okay with shipping the framework &amp; compilers, and having another beta of the IDE, since most of the problems are centered there.    That being said, Microsoft decided that this isn&#x27;t the road they are going to follow. The past is the past, what I want now is to make sure that I wouldn&#x27;t spend the next two years struggling with bugs and hearing how great Orcas is. I had opened a suggestion for a service pack for Visual Studio 2005&#xA0;in the next three to six months. Go and vote for it.    I think that having a bug fixing only service pack in this time frame is reasonable, and would go a long way to smooth a lot of ruffled feathers. Microsoft should announce it soon. So far, I see far too many posts about problems with RTM, and not enough gushing about how great it is.     That said, this post really pisses me off:    &#xA0;Finally, a brief thought about those issues we are able to fix. You should expect that the majority of these fixes will be available first in the next major product version.     This one is from the&#xA0;DDCPX&#xA0;blog, the (take a deep breath)&#xA0;Developer Division Customer Product-Lifecycle Experience Team. It basically says: Get used to those bugs, they&#x27;ll be with you for a long time.    I don&#x27;t think that a product as big as VS.Net can ship completely bug free, but I do think that there should be a support story for it. And posting workarounds is not a good solution. Take for instance the suggested workaround for improving Refactoring speed for solutions that contains web projects: Open all the web pages in the project before doing refactoring, find all references, etc. This goes contrary to the way I work (open as few windows as possible) that it isn&#x27;t even funny.    Fixing those bugs, and much sooner than Orcas, should be a high priority task for Microsoft, because otherwise they are putting a very tempting target for any other company that can do better than that. We have asked repeatedly to concentrate on stability and performance. Microsoft has a really well written answer for that in the suggestion&#xA0;about another beta for VS 2005, but it&#x27;s just not enough. Not in the face of the bugs we are facing.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After slamming so much into VS.Net, some might think that I don&#x27;t like it. This couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. I really like it. If I didn&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t be so pissed off about the finishing touches.    When working on MonoRail, I&#x27;ve to use Visual Studio 2003. And it&#x27;s plainly visible where they gotten things better. Hell, just the visuals of setting a breakpoint in 2003 vs 2005. Are they functionaly the same? Yes, but the 2005 makes me feel better.    Speaking about breakpoints, debugging in VS 2005 is much better. Using F11 to go into a method that is called by code that isn&#x27;t yours is so much better than finding the method and putting a break point there. Debug Visualizers are a killer. The whole experiance is so much better. It&#x27;s just that there are some very rough spots, in particulary nasty places, too.    Here is a tip for those of you who has to work with a project on both 2003 &amp; 2005. Clear out the obj directories before switching. There is a lot of stuff there that would kill VS 2003.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So a couple of days ago I posted the Do you grok C# 2.0&#xA0;challange. Here is the code that I presented:using&#xA0;System;    using&#xA0;System.Collections.Generic;    public&#xA0;class&#xA0;Sample&lt;T&gt;&#xA0;where&#xA0;T:class        {    &#xA0;private&#xA0;static&#xA0;string&#xA0;typeName&#xA0;=&#xA0;typeof(T).FullName;    &#xA0;    &#xA0;public&#xA0;string&#xA0;TypeName    &#xA0;{    &#xA0;&#xA0;get&#xA0;{&#xA0;return&#xA0;typeName;&#xA0;}    &#xA0;}    &#xA0;    &#xA0;    &#xA0;public&#xA0;List&lt;Printer&gt;&#xA0;PrintNumbers()    &#xA0;{    &#xA0;&#xA0;string&#xA0;[]&#xA0;names&#xA0;=&#xA0;{&#xA0;&quot;Ayende&quot;,&#xA0;&quot;Rahien&quot;,&#xA0;&quot;Foo&quot;,&#xA0;&quot;Bar&quot;&#xA0;};    &#xA0;&#xA0;List&lt;Printer&gt;&#xA0;list&#xA0;=&#xA0;new&#xA0;List&lt;Printer&gt;&#xA0;();    &#xA0;&#xA0;foreach(string&#xA0;s&#xA0;in&#xA0;names)    &#xA0;&#xA0;{    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;list.Add(&#xA0;delegate(){&#xA0;Console.WriteLine(s);&#xA0;}&#xA0;);    &#xA0;&#xA0;}    &#xA0;&#xA0;return&#xA0;list;    &#xA0;}    }    public&#xA0;delegate&#xA0;void&#xA0;Printer();    public&#xA0;class&#xA0;Start    {    &#xA0;public&#xA0;static&#xA0;void&#xA0;Main()    &#xA0;{    &#xA0;&#xA0;Console.WriteLine(new&#xA0;Sample&lt;Type&gt;().TypeName);    &#xA0;&#xA0;Console.WriteLine(new&#xA0;Sample&lt;string&gt;().TypeName);    &#xA0;&#xA0;foreach(Printer&#xA0;print&#xA0;in&#xA0;new&#xA0;Sample&lt;Start&gt;().PrintNumbers())    &#xA0;&#xA0;{    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;print();    &#xA0;&#xA0;}    &#xA0;}    }    The output of this code is:System.Type    System.String    Bar    Bar    Bar    Bar    What is going on in here? Well, the two first lines are different because the compiler generate a different class for each generic type that you pass. This means that the static field is different, so it stores two different values, even though it&#x27;s look like we only have one.    This is useful because you can use a static field to store information that is only relevant for one type of the class. I&#x27;m taking advantage of this to cache&#xA0;information on the type level.    The second issue is the printing of Bar, Bar, Bar, Bar. Beer and bars aside, the problem here is that the C# compiler doesn&#x27;t produce a true closure in this case. It sees that we&#x27;re only using a single variable, so it promote it to a field, and all the anonymous delegates we&#x27;ve created will use the class field. So in this case, they will all point to the same field, and all print the same item.    A way around this is to introduce a temporary variable, which would force the compiler to make sure that each delegate has its own values, and so it would create a class for the whole thing, and we would get the expected output, with each delegate printing a different value.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x27;m currently watching the Scripting and Dynamic Languages on the CLR&#xA0;session from the PDC. Rodrigo (creator of Boo) is there, and it&#x27;s a very interesting discussion.&#xA0;I still think that Boo is the best language on the CLR, mainly because I, as a user, can write what I want, and not how I want it.    Rodrigo mentioned the IReflect interface, which was new to me. Any idea what is it used for in the CLR right now, beside Type?    On adding keywords to the language: VB.Net &amp; C# took different approaches. VB.Net just added new keywords, C# hacked them with optional keywords.    Oh, and meta programming is fun.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It&#x27;s a little known fact that Microsoft managed to add time traveling capabilities to web projects.    In order to activate this capability, all you need to do is to discover a bug in your application. Suppose it&#x27;s an instantly recognizable, and instantly fixable. Now, in order for this to work, the bug must be in a library that the web project references.    Fix the bug, and run the application again. It works! :-) Dance a little jig, and then keep on working. Five seconds later, you&#x27;ll discover the same bug. After much head scratching, you&#x27;ll realize that somehow the web project pulled the old version out of the past, and used that, reintroducing the bug.    I&#x27;m really in awe to the Microsoft Engineers that are responsible for this feature. I especially like the way they made it bullet proof. I tried to hack around this great feature by cleaning the solution, rebuilding, physically deleting the files from the hard disk, cutting the head of a chicken and praying to the rain gods. But this is a solid feature, no matter how much I tried to break it, it keep serving me the past version of my library.    Oh, I got it for a few seconds, here and there, but the great time traveling feature of web project always managed to bring me back to my initial state. Then I tried the Weapon Of Doom, I restarted Visual Studio, but they were good, those anonymous engineers in Microsoft. They thought of that as well and made sure that the time traveling effects would persist across sessions.    I got to hand it to them, this is truly innovative feature. I mean, other IDEs has time traveling machines as well, we call them source controls. I guess that the Team System engineers were so fired up about their product that they just couldn&#x27;t resist putting it into web projects as well. Just to give us a taste of what we can expect if we&#x27;ll use Team System.    This is the only reasonable explenation, isn&#x27;t it? After all, updating a library that a web project is using is going to be a common operation, it&#x27;s not as if the web project does this maliciously, isn&#x27;t it? Please tell me it&#x27;s not so...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Amazon solved the AI problem. They pay a human to do the things a computer is not smart enough to do.    The idea is that you have a very complex problem that a human could solve instantly, such as: &quot;Is there a red balon on this picture?&quot; You make a web service call, and somewhere a human will look at the problem, and solve it to you. You program thinks that it just called a normal external service. The human gets some money for each task s/he complete. This is very cool. And very scary. I&#x27;m reminded of SF books that had a similar idea, but with pain/pleasure receptors instead of money.     Assuming that the cost of each task is 0.2$, and a human can answer 45 tasks per hour, 8 hours a day, that is 72$ a day, which translate to about 22.5 thousands of dollars a year (6 work days per week). Considering that the only thing that you need to do is to use the pattern matching part of the brain, it&#x27;s really cool.    I can certainly see people who do that for a living. Consider the difference in buying power from the First World to the Third World, and you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s a pretty lucartive offer in many markets. In addition to that, it&#x27;s soemthing that require no skills and no training. You can do use that to reduce unemployement for lots of areas.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Seems to me that there is a lof of bugs in the RTM version of Visual Studio 2005.&#xA0;Here is a random collection of things that I run into recently:     Wesner Moise, Frans Brouma, Roy Osherove, Michael Teper         and Rolf Bjarne&#xA0;all have found bugs that I would categorize as Very Serious.    I myself have run into this bug, and ReSharper is nearly unusable because VS.Net doesn&#x27;t respect the colors that ReSharper tells it to paint. (It paints strange stuff that is horrible to look at.) The whole IDE seems slower than 2003. And I have expressed my opinion&#xA0;about the way it handle those simple things like testing&#xA0;and&#xA0;web projects.    It&#x27;s interesting to note that nearly all those bugs were known to Microsoft, but were closed because of time constraints. I&#x27;m shocked that even after countless CTPs and two betas, there are so many serious-you&#x27;ll-lose-work-and-tear-out-your-hair bugs in the product. Refactoring is useless the moment you&#x27;ve a web project, period.     I think that there are great things in VS 2005, debug visualizer and great, for instance. But the product is not ready for RTM, in my opinion. Perhaps it is that only since the Beta 2 Go Live license people has started to really move toward VS 2005. It was only then that the more esotoric bugs were found. By then, most of those bugs were resolved as Won&#x27;t-Fix because of the short time to RTM.    What really frightens me is comments such as Suma&#x27;s:    This is a known issue that got reported by a customer via MSDN feedback center and given the late state of the product cycle, we had to postpone the bug. [snip]    We are going to look into this for the next version of the product,     The emphasis is mine. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m not ready to wait until 2007 &amp; Orcas to get a functional IDE.     I think that it&#x27;s imperative that the tools we&#x27;re using to help us develop will actually.. well, help us develop. If I find myself working in spite of a tool, I&#x27;ll look elsewhere to something that will replace it. Until now, VS was the crowned king of the .Net IDEs, but with those problems, it&#x27;s possible for a competitor to show up and turn the tables on Microsoft.    There is such a competitor, it&#x27;s called JetBrains, and they have superb IDE for Java called IdeaJ. They are going to release an IDE for .Net, which I&#x27;m looking forward to use. I don&#x27;t have any sentiments about my tools. If another tool offer me enough functionality, I&#x27;ll move.    I&#x27;m not the only one who commented about being more productive in Visual Studio 2003 &#x2B; ReSharper than in Visual Studio 2005 without it. If JetBrains can produce an IDE that would be as smart as ReSharper, they won me. If they can create a transperant experiance for the developer, they will win everyone.    On other news, I created a suggestion on lady bug for a service pack for Visual Studio 2005. I don&#x27;t think that it would help, but I certainly hope that they would listen for this. I can&#x27;t remember having nearly as many problems in either Visual Studio 2003 or 2002.    Update:&#xA0; Anatoly Lubarsky was bitten&#xA0;as well. It&#x27;s becoming a meme.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x27;m a developer, I&#x27;m not a dba. I can design and use a SQL database that wouldn&#x27;t make a sane dba wail in despair, but I&#x27;ll gladly hand off the desicions about data to someone else. It&#x27;s not something that interest me.    Administrating a database server is something that should be left to the expert, and I don&#x27;t have time to be an expert. But recently I need to run my project against SQL Express, and I started to get access denied errors. Here are the exact steps that I needed to use in order to let ASPNET access the database.            &gt;osql -S .\SQLExpress -E                1) sp_grantlogin &#x27;.\ASPNet&#x27;        2) go        1) use testdb;        2) go        1) sp_grantdbaccess &#x27;.\ASPNet&#x27;        2) go        1) grant select, update, delete, insert on table_name to [.\ASPNet]        -- repeat 30 more times for each table        31) go        It took me several hours and a lot of frustration to find that out. Since SQL Express seems to be designed to make developers happy, where is the nice UI that would make me deal with this stuff? I tried to use the Express Manager a couple of months ago, but that was utterly inusable, configuration wise.</p>
