            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Take a look at the following code:             1:  var docs = new dynamic[0];&#xA;&#xA;       2:  var q = from doc in docs&#xA;&#xA;       3:          where doc[&quot;@metadata&quot;][&quot;Raven-Entity-Name&quot;] == &quot;Cases&quot;&#xA;&#xA;       4:          where doc.AssociatedEntities != null&#xA;&#xA;       5:          from entity in doc.AssociatedEntities&#xA;&#xA;       6:          where entity.Tags != null // COMPILER ERROR HERE&#xA;&#xA;       7:          from tag in entity.Tags&#xA;&#xA;       8:          where tag.ReferencedAggregate != null&#xA;&#xA;       9:          select new {tag.ReferencedAggregate.Id, doc.__document_id};        &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;It doesn&#x2019;t compiles, complaining about an error in line 6 (The property &#x27;&lt;&gt;h__TransparentIdentifier0&#x27; cannot be used with type arguments).&#xA;&#xA;Leaving aside the issue with the error itself, which is about as useful as C&#x2B;&#x2B; template errors, I have a strongly issue with this.&#xA;&#xA;What do you think can fix this error? Well, if you remove line 8 (!), it just works:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;       1:  var docs = new dynamic[0];&#xA;&#xA;       2:  var q = from doc in docs&#xA;&#xA;       3:          where doc[&quot;@metadata&quot;][&quot;Raven-Entity-Name&quot;] == &quot;Cases&quot;&#xA;&#xA;       4:          where doc.AssociatedEntities != null&#xA;&#xA;       5:          from entity in doc.AssociatedEntities&#xA;&#xA;       6:          where entity.Tags != null&#xA;&#xA;       7:          from tag in entity.Tags&#xA;&#xA;       8:          select new { tag.ReferencedAggregate.Id, doc.__document_id };&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;There are several things that I can&#x2019;t figure out:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  Why am I getting an error?&#xA;&#xA;  Why removing a line after the error fixes the error in the line before it.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;What I suspect is that the error reporting (which in C# is usually damn good) is getting confused with the error reporting location.&#xA;&#xA;To make things worse, this code will crash VS 2010 every single time. I am actually editing this in notepad!!!&#xA;&#xA;Here is the set of extensions methods that I use here:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  public static class LinqOnDynamic&#xA;{&#xA;    private static IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt; Select(this object self)&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (self == null)&#xA;            yield break;&#xA;        if (self is IEnumerable == false || self is string)&#xA;            throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;Attempted to enumerate over &quot; &#x2B; self.GetType().Name);&#xA;&#xA;        foreach (var item in ((IEnumerable) self))&#xA;        {&#xA;            yield return item;&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public static IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt; SelectMany(this object source,&#xA;                                                    Func&lt;dynamic, int, IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;&gt; collectionSelector,&#xA;                                                    Func&lt;dynamic, dynamic, dynamic&gt; resultSelector)&#xA;    {&#xA;        return Enumerable.SelectMany(Select(source), collectionSelector, resultSelector);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public static IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt; SelectMany(this object source,&#xA;                                                    Func&lt;dynamic, IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;&gt; collectionSelector,&#xA;                                                    Func&lt;dynamic, dynamic, dynamic&gt; resultSelector)&#xA;    {&#xA;        return Enumerable.SelectMany(Select(source), collectionSelector, resultSelector);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public static IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt; SelectMany(this object source,&#xA;                                                    Func&lt;object, IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;&gt; selector)&#xA;    {&#xA;        return Select(source).SelectMany&lt;object, object&gt;(selector);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public static IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt; SelectMany(this object source,&#xA;                                                                    Func&lt;object, int, IEnumerable&lt;dynamic&gt;&gt; selector)&#xA;    {&#xA;        return Select(source).SelectMany&lt;object, object&gt;(selector);&#xA;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;WTF?!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I decided to spend some time with Excel trying to do a look back at how things are doing. I am not going to give you numbers, but the trends in the data are interesting. All the data is relevant to this year only.  &#xA0;     Tell me that the top one doesn&#x2019;t remind you of a rude gesture. As you can see, NHibernate rules the roost here, on the bottom, it is even clearer. I think that a lot of that is that I am closely related to NHibernate that is making the difference.                    Looking at the data over time gives me a very interesting perspective about the introduction of subscriptions. That was expected, but I don&#x2019;t think that I really grokked that. Looking at the bottom image, I can tell you that subscriptions are pretty big, from the point of view of license numbers, but they are much weaker from the point of view of money in the bank.I knew that, I even wanted that, since the whole point of subscriptions was to get sustainable revenue stream rather than money today. But I wasn&#x2019;t really ready for that.     This one is particularly annoying, because there is a dry spot around the 20th every single month, and I get abandonment anxiety at that time.  That is it for now :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is part of what looks to be long series of posts about tooling relating to NHibernate. &#xA;In this case, I want to talk about LLBLGen Pro. &#xA;LLBLGen Pro&#xA0;3.0 is an OR/M tool that also comes with an NHibernate option. Because it is the GUI tool to manage NHibernate mapping that I am testing, I am going to show a lot of screenshots. Also, please note that I am using this without any foreknowledge, reading the docs, or anything. I am also not going to do an in depth discussion, just use it to see how those things are working. &#xA;After installation, we start a new project: &#xA; &#xA;Which give us the following (scary) dialog. Note all the tabs in the bottom. There is a huge number of options and knows that you can tweak. &#xA; &#xA;The next step that I wanted to do is to see how it handles an existing data model, so I decided to add the test model that I use for NHibernate: &#xA;  &#xA;This takes about zero time and gives us the entities. It properly recognize 1:m associations, but I had to define the m:n associations myself. I am not sure if this is what I am supposed to do or if I just missed something. What is impressive is that the schema in question is actually being generated from NHibernate through the SchemaExport tool. So we went a full cycle, NHibernate mapping, schema, extracting everything to the following model: &#xA; &#xA;I wonder if I can get LLBLGen Pro&#xA0;to read a set of NHibernate mapping as well, because this view of the mapping can be very useful. &#xA;But enough talking about the UI, there are a lot of tools that have great UI, I want to see what code it generates. &#xA;As an aside, I like this part of the code generation: &#xA; &#xA;Not so much because what there is there, but because it implies how the code generation process itself is structured. &#xA;I was surprised when I saw this: &#xA;  &#xA;It brought back flashbacks of 1.0, but they are empty, I assume that this is vestigial remain in the template. &#xA;I don&#x2019;t like that CategoriesPost is there, but I couldn&#x2019;t figure out how to remove it, this isn&#x2019;t an entity, it is an association table. &#xA;Looking at the code, there is one thing that really bothers me, take a look at the property definitions. How do you set that? &#xA; &#xA;I am pretty sure that I did something to cause that, but I really don&#x2019;t have any idea what. &#xA;&#xA;Update: (This is written before the post is published, but after I had time to review what I did). It appears that I played with too many settings, there is an option called EmitFieldSetter that I accidently set to false. The idea behind this setting that you want to allow setting properties via methods, not via direct properties.&#xA;&#xA;I&#x2019;ll ignore that for now, and look at the rest of the code. In addition to the Model project, LLBLGen Pro&#xA0;also generates the Persistence project: &#xA; &#xA;I was quite surprised to see that it uses class maps, but then I looked at the code: &#xA;&#xA;/// &lt;summary&gt;Represents the mapping of the &#x27;Blog&#x27; entity, represented by the &#x27;Blog&#x27; class.&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;public class BlogMap : ClassMap&lt;Blog&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    /// &lt;summary&gt;Initializes a new instance of the &lt;see cref=&quot;BlogMap&quot;/&gt; class.&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;    public BlogMap()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Table(&quot;[dbo].[Blogs]&quot;);&#xA;        OptimisticLock.Version();&#xA;        LazyLoad();&#xA;&#xA;        Id(x=&gt;x.Id)&#xA;            .Access.CamelCaseField(Prefix.Underscore)&#xA;            .Column(&quot;Id&quot;)&#xA;            .GeneratedBy.Identity();&#xA;        Map(x=&gt;x.AllowsComments).Access.CamelCaseField(Prefix.Underscore);&#xA;        Map(x=&gt;x.CreatedAt).Access.CamelCaseField(Prefix.Underscore);&#xA;        Map(x=&gt;x.Subtitle).Access.CamelCaseField(Prefix.Underscore);&#xA;        Map(x=&gt;x.Title).Access.CamelCaseField(Prefix.Underscore);&#xA;&#xA;        HasMany(x=&gt;x.Posts)&#xA;            .Access.CamelCaseField(Prefix.Underscore)&#xA;            .Cascade.AllDeleteOrphan()&#xA;            .Fetch.Select()&#xA;            .AsSet()&#xA;            .Inverse()&#xA;            .LazyLoad()&#xA;            .KeyColumns.Add(&quot;BlogId&quot;);&#xA;        HasManyToMany(x=&gt;x.Users)&#xA;            .Access.CamelCaseField(Prefix.Underscore)&#xA;            .Cascade.AllDeleteOrphan()&#xA;            .Fetch.Select()&#xA;            .AsSet()&#xA;            .Table(&quot;[dbo].[UsersBlogs]&quot;)&#xA;            .ParentKeyColumns.Add(&quot;BlogId&quot;)&#xA;            .ChildKeyColumns.Add(&quot;UserId&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;    } &#xA;} &#xA;&#xA;That is highly readable, and a lot of people prefer that, and I guess it is easier than generating the XML. &#xA;Did you see the SessionManager class? It also handles all the wiring of NHibernate, so you can start using it by just getting the session: &#xA;&#xA;SessionManager.OpenSession()&#xA;&#xA;Overall, very impressive. From installation to working code (except that annoying no setter thingie), it took mere minutes, and the code is clean. That is one of the things that I always hated with code generators, they generally produce crappy code, so I was very happy to see how the code looked like. &#xA;Now, after the whirlwind tour, let me see if I can look at more of the options. &#xA;Oh, it looks like it can generate HBM files, let us give that a try: &#xA;&#xA;&lt;class name=&quot;Blog&quot; table=&quot;[dbo].[Blogs]&quot; optimistic-lock=&quot;version&quot; &gt;&#xA;    &lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot; column=&quot;Id&quot; access=&quot;field.camelcase-underscore&quot; &gt;&#xA;        &lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/id&gt;&#xA;    &lt;property name=&quot;AllowsComments&quot; column=&quot;AllowsComments&quot; access=&quot;field.camelcase-underscore&quot;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;property name=&quot;CreatedAt&quot; column=&quot;CreatedAt&quot; access=&quot;field.camelcase-underscore&quot;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;property name=&quot;Subtitle&quot; column=&quot;Subtitle&quot; access=&quot;field.camelcase-underscore&quot;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;property name=&quot;Title&quot; column=&quot;Title&quot; access=&quot;field.camelcase-underscore&quot;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;set name=&quot;Posts&quot; access=&quot;field.camelcase-underscore&quot; cascade=&quot;all-delete-orphan&quot; inverse=&quot;true&quot; fetch=&quot;select&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;key&gt;&#xA;            &lt;column name=&quot;BlogId&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/key&gt;&#xA;        &lt;one-to-many class=&quot;Post&quot;/&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/set&gt;&#xA;    &lt;set name=&quot;Users&quot; access=&quot;field.camelcase-underscore&quot; table=&quot;[dbo].[UsersBlogs]&quot; cascade=&quot;all-delete-orphan&quot; fetch=&quot;select&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;key&gt;&#xA;            &lt;column name=&quot;BlogId&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/key&gt;&#xA;        &lt;many-to-many class=&quot;User&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;column name=&quot;UserId&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/many-to-many&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/set&gt;&#xA;&lt;/class&gt;&#xA;&#xA;There is one main thing to note here, this looks pretty much like it was written by a human. There are still some things to improve, but compare that to the output of Fluent NHibernate, and you&#x2019;ll see that this is generating something that is much easier to work with. &#xA;Some things that still bothers me: &#xA;&#xA;    Kick all the access=&#x201D;field.camelcase-underscore&#x201D; to the default-access on the &lt;hibernate-mapping&gt; element, that would remove a lot of duplication. &#xA;    The table=&#x201D;[dbo].[UsersBlogs]&#x201D; should be table=&#x201D;`UsersBlogs`&#x201D; schema=&#x201D;`dbo`&#x201D;, and I would skip the catalog if it is dbo already. &#xA;    The class contains an optimistic-lock=&#x201D;version&#x201D;, but there is no version column, so this should go away as well. The same error appears in the fluent nhibernate mapping as well. &#xA;&#xA;Let us see what else I can play with. &#xA;There is something called Typed Views, which I didn&#x2019;t understand at first: &#xA; &#xA;It appears that instead of generating an entity (which has associations, collections, references, etc), this build just a bare bone class to hold the data. The purpose, I believe, is to use this for reporting/binding scenarios, in which case a view model is much more appropriate. This is one features that the CQRS guys are probably going to like. &#xA;Oh, I found the m:n option: &#xA; &#xA;With that, I get: &#xA; &#xA;I probably need to change the name generation pattern, though :-) &#xA;I would suggest running the labels on the UI through PascalCaseToSentence, though. That is, instead of having to read AutoAddManyToManyRelationships, turn that to &#x201C;Auto add many to many relationships&#x201D;. &#xA;There is another feature, called TypedList, which gives you a query designer for building NHibernate queries (they are translated to HQL) which looked nice, but I haven&#x2019;t looked at too closely. The way I usually work, queries are too context sensitive to allow to create the sort of query library that would make this feature useful. &#xA;This has been a very short run through LLBLGen Pro&#xA0;in its NHibernate mode. Overall, it looks very impressive, and it generates the best code that I have seen yet out of a tool. Good enough to take and use as is. &#xA;The only detraction that I could find is the name, (yes, I know that I talked about this before), LLBLGen Pro just doesn&#x2019;t roll off the tongue.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post, I discussed the following scenario, a smart client application for managing Machines, Parts &amp; Maintenance History:     From the client perspective, Machine,Parts &amp; Maintenance History where all part of the same entity, and they wanted to be able to be able return that to the user in a single call. They run into several problems in doing that, mostly, from what I could see, because they tried to do something that I strongly discourage, sending entities on the wire so they could be displayed on the smart client application. The client uses CSLA, so the actual business logic is sitting in Factory objects (I discussed my objection to that practice here), but the entities are still doing triple duty here. They need to be saved to the database, serve as DTOs on the wire and also handle being presented in the UI.   When I objected to that practice, I was asked: &#x201C;Are we supposed to have three duplicates of everything in the application? One for the database, one for the wire and one for the UI? That is insane!&#x201D;  The answer to this question is:    This is the symbol for Mu, which is the answer you give when the question is meaningless.   The problem with the question as posed is that it contains an invalid assumption. The assumption is that the three separate models in the application are identical to one another. They aren&#x2019;t, not by a long shot.  Let me see if I can explain it better with an example. Given the Machine &#x2013;&gt;&gt; Part &#x2013;&gt;&gt; Maintenance History model, and an application to manage those as our backdrop. We will take two sample scenarios to discuss, the first would be to record replacing a part in a machine, and the second would be looking at a list of machines that need fixing.  For the first scenario, we need to show the user the Maintenance screen for the machine, which looks like this:     And on the second one, machines requiring fixes, we have:     Now, both of those screens are driven by data in the Machine &#x2013;&gt;&gt; Part &#x2013;&gt;&gt; Maintenance History model. But they have very different data requirements.  In the first case, we need the Machine.Name, Machine.NextMaintenanceDate, and a list of Part.SKU, Part.Name, Part.Broken, Part.Notes.  In the second case, we need Machine.Owner, Machine.Car, Machine.Age, Machine.Preferred.  The data set that they require is completely different, not only that, but sending the full object graph to each of those is a waste. If you noticed, no one actually even needed Maintenance History for any of those screens. It is likely that Maintenance History will be only needed rarely, but by saying that there is only one model that needs to serve all those different scenarios, we are tying ourselves into knots, because we need to serve Maintenance History every time that we are asked for a machine, even though it is not needed.  The way I would design the system, I would have:  Entities: Machine, Part, Maintenance History  This is the full data model that we use. Note that I am not discussing issues like CQRS here, because the application doesn&#x2019;t warrant it. A single model for everything would work well here.  DTO: MachineHeaderDTO, MachineAndPartsDTO, PartAndMaintenanceHistoryDTO, etc.  We have specific DTOs for each scenario, only giving us the data that we need, so we can spare a lot of effort in the server side in deciding how to fill the data.  View Models  The view models would be built on top of the DTOs, usually providing some additional services like INotifyPropertyChanged, calculated properties, client side validation, etc.  I am in favor of each screen having its own View Models, because that lead to a self contained application, but I wouldn&#x2019;t have a problem with common view models shared among the entire application.  Sample application  And because I know you&#x2019;ll want to see some code, the Alexandria sample application demonstrate those concepts quite well: http://github.com/ayende/alexandria</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Microsoft LightSwitch is a new 4GL tool from Microsoft, this is another in the series of &#x201C;you don&#x2019;t have to write any code&#x201D; tools that I have seen.  Those are the tools that will give the secretary the ability to create applications and eliminate the need for coders. The industry has been chasing those tools since the 80s (does anyone remember the promises of the CASE tools?). We have seen many attempts at doing this, and all of them have run into a wall pretty quickly.   Oh, you can build a tool that gives you UI on top of a data store pretty easily. And you can go pretty far with it, but eventually your ability to point &amp; click hit the limit, and you have to write code. And that is things totally breaks down.  LightSwitch is not yet publically available, so I have to rely on the presentation that Microsoft published. And I can tell you that I am filled with dread, based on what I have seen.  First of all, I strongly object to the following slide. Because I have the experience to know that working with a tool like that is akin to do back flips with a straightjacket on.     The capabilities of the tools that were shown in the presentation have strongly underwhelmed me in terms of newness, complexity or applicability.   Yeah, a meta data driven UI. Yeah, it can do validation on a phone number automatically (really, what happen with my Israeli based phone number?), etc. What is worse, even through the demo, I get the very strong feeling that the whole things is incredibly slow, you can see in the presentation multi second delays between screen repaints.   Then there are things like &#x201C;it just works as a web app or windows app&#x201D; which is another pipe dream that the industry has been chasing for a while. And the only piece of code that I have seen is this guy:  &#xA0;   Which makes me want to break down and cry.  Do you know why? Because this is going to be the essence of a SELECT N&#x2B;1 in any system, because this code is going to run once per each row in the grid. And when I can find bugs from watching a presentation, you know that there are going to be more issues.  So, just for fun sake, since I don&#x2019;t have the bits and I can rely only on the presentation, I decided to make a list of all the things that are likely to be wrong with LightSwitch.  I&#x2019;ll review it when it comes out, and if it does manage to do everything that it does and still be a tool usable by developers, I&#x2019;ll have to eat crow (well, Raven :-) ), but I am not overly worried.  Here are a few areas where I am feeling certain things will not work right:     Source control &#x2013; how do I diff two versions of the app to see what changes? Are all changes diffable?     Programmatic modifications:         what happen when I want to write some code to do custom validation of property (for instance, calling a web service)?      what happen when I want to put a custom control on the screen (for instance, a google maps widget)?       Upsizing &#x2013; when it gets to a 1,000 users and we need a full blown app, how hard it is to do?    Performance &#x2013; as I said, I think it is slow from the demo.    Data access behavior &#x2013; from what I have seen so far, I am willing to be that it hits its data store pretty heavily.   I fully recognize that there is a need for such a tool, make no mistake. And giving users the ability to do that is important. What I strongly object to is the notion that it would be useful for developers writing real apps, not forms over data. To put it simply, simple forms over data is a solved problem. There is a large number of tools out there to do that. From Access to Oracle Apex to FoxPro. Hell, most CRM solutions will give you just that.  My concern is that there seems to be an emphasis on that being useful for developers as well, and I strongly doubt that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">At a client site, I found the following in all the mapping files:     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;&#xA;&lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns=&quot;urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2&quot; default-lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;class name=&quot;Machine&quot; table=&quot;Machines&quot; lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/id&gt;&#xA;        &lt;property name=&quot;Name&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;set name=&quot;Parts&quot; table=&quot;Parts&quot; lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;key column=&quot;BlogId&quot;/&gt;&#xA;            &lt;one-to-many class=&quot;Part&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/set&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/class&gt;&#xA;&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I think that you can figure out by now what is wrong. It is too bad that the &lt;blink/&gt; tag has gone out of use, because that would be an accurate reflection of how I responded when I saw that. After I finished frothing at the mouth, I explained that you never ever do things like, because it leads to pain, mayhem and tears. &#xA;&#xA;The lead dev heard me out, then explained that their situation wasn&#x2019;t a standard web application, their server had some business functionality, but it served mainly as a way for clients to come in and get some data. The architecture looks like this:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;As you can imagine, NHibernate is sitting in the Application tier, but a lot of the work is done on the smart client application.&#xA;&#xA;The lead dev explained that in their scenario, they needed to send the full entity to the smart client app, so they didn&#x2019;t want lazy loading. Their scenario also precluded the need to do lazy loading over the network, so all was good, and they made the decision to use lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D; intentionally. Their model was pretty good about not having deeply connected object graphs, too.&#xA;&#xA;I hit Google and searched for the relevant posts:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  ayende strippers &#x2013; Which leads to the post: The Stripper Pattern. &#xA;&#xA;  castrate ayende * &#x2013; Which leads to the post: Don&#x2019;t castrate your architecture &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;* Googling that made me very nervous.&#xA;&#xA;I include the search terms as a reminder to myself that post titles are important, because that is how I search for them after the fact. And I got some really strong (and strange) looks when I did that.&#xA;&#xA;After we discussed that we put it aside and moved to other topics. Until we came to the part where we profiled the system.&#xA;&#xA;We immediately found some trouble spots that we needed to resolve. One of them was getting a list of machines that required fixing.&#xA;&#xA;The problem was that the code looked something like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  public IEnumerable&lt;Machine&gt; GetMachinesRequiringFixes()&#xA;{&#xA;    return (from machine in session.Linq&lt;Machine&gt;()&#xA;           where machine.Status == Statuses.Broken&#xA;           select machine).Take(10);&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Looks easy, right?&#xA;&#xA;Except that this seemingly innocent piece of code was responsible for 400 queries.&#xA;&#xA;What went wrong? How could loading 10 machines result in that many queries?&#xA;&#xA;Well, let us look what NHibernate did, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;select top 10 * from Machines where Status = &#x27;Broken&#x27;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This gives NHibernate ten machines instances, except that when NHibernate investigate the mapping for a Machine, it realizes that it needs to load the Parts collection, since it was marked lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, so NHibernate will execute ten queries for loading each Machine&#x2019;s Parts.&#xA;&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 40&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 41&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 42&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 43&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 44&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 45&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 46&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 47&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 48&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 49&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But each Part also has an association for a MaintenanceHistory, which was also marked lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, so NHibernate had to load those as well. (I&#x2019;ll spare you that one :-) ).&#xA;&#xA;From the client perspective, Machine,Parts &amp; Maintenance History where all part of the same entity, and they wanted to be able to be able return that to the user in a single call. (More on that fallacy in my next post).&#xA;&#xA;The problem is that when you set lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, you literally ties NHibernate&#x2019;s hands. Now, you could start playing with the fetch mode option, to change that to join or subselect, but the problem is that this works when you have only one collection association (in the entire graph), because otherwise you run into sever Cartesian products issues.&#xA;&#xA;Now, NHibernate has the ability to handle just that scenario, but by setting lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, you prevent NHibernate from having the chance to actually utilize them.&#xA;&#xA;There is a good reason why lazy is set to true by default, and while I am sure that there is some limited number of scenarios where lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D; is the appropriate choice, it isn&#x2019;t for your scenario.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just read a very insightful post from Evan Nagle about the topic. In it, Evan hit a key point:     Technically (and commercially) speaking, Microsoft has a slew of perfectly legitimate reasons for splattering the landscape with these &quot;watered down&quot; technologies. But, culturally speaking, it&#x27;s painful to the professional Microsoft developer. It is. Because the Microsoft developer&#x27;s personal and professional identity is tied up in the Microsoft stack, and that stack is now catering to a bunch of cat ladies and acne-laden teenagers. That&#x27;s the real issue here.   If Microsoft thinks that they can get the market for bad developers, good for them. But that needs to be highly segmented. It should be clear that going with that route is leading you to a walled garden and that writing real apps this way is not good. The best comparison I can think of is Access apps in the 90s. There was a clear separation between &#x201C;just wanna write some forms over data app over the weekend&#x201D; and &#x201C;I want to build a real application&#x201D;. When you built an app in Access, you had very clear idea about the limitations of the application, and you knew that if you wanted something more, it would be a complete re-write.  That was a good thing, because it meant that you could do the quick &amp; dirty things, but when things got messy, you knew that you had to make the jump.  The problem with things like Microsoft.Data is that there is no such line in the sand. And when you call it &#x201C;Microsoft.*&#x201D; you give it a seal of approval for everything. And when you have a piece of code that is explicitly designed to support bad coding practices, it is like peeing in the pool. If there is only one pool, it is going to affect everyone. There wouldn&#x2019;t be nearly as much objection if it was called WebMatrix.Data, because that would clearly put it in someone else&#x2019;s pool, and it that turn into a putrid swamp, I don&#x2019;t really care.   There is another issue here, and it is not just that the community is afraid of inheriting horrible Microsoft.Data projects. It is much more than that.   Salary data is from the UK, because that is the first site I found with the numbers)     C# average salary: &#xA3;42,000    VB.NET average salary: &#xA3;34,000   Now, I really can&#x2019;t think of a good technical reason why VB.Net programmers are paid so much less, but those data points match what I have seen about salaries for developers in both positions.  In other words, VB.Net developers are getting paid a lot less for doing the same job.  Now, why is that? Is it because of the legacy of VisualBasic still haunts the VB guys? Because there is still the impression that VB is a toy language? I don&#x2019;t know, but I think that at least in part, that is true. And that is what happen when a platform gets a reputation for being messy. People know in their bones that building stuff there is going to be costly, because maintaining this stuff is so hard.   Microsoft has repeatedly stated that they are after the people who currently go to PHP. Let me do the same comparison:     PHP average salary: &#xA3;32,500    Ruby average salary: &#xA3;45,000    Python average salary: &#xA3;47,500   I don&#x2019;t like those numbers. I really don&#x2019;t like them.   Put simply, if Microsoft attempts to make the .NET platform more approachable for the PHP guys, it is also going to devalue the entire platform. I am pretty sure that this is something that they don&#x2019;t want. Having a lot of hobbist programmer but fewer professional ones is going to hurt the Microsoft eco system.  Microsoft, if you want to create a PHP haven in the .NET world, that is great, but make sure that it is completely isolated, because otherwise you are going to hurt everyone who has a commercial stake in your platform.  I think that there is a lot of sense from commercial point of view in WebMatrix, but it should be clear that this isn&#x2019;t .NET programming, this is WebMatrix programming. So if Microsoft succeed in gaining market share for this, it won&#x2019;t be the .NET developers who would suddenly look at a 30% less money, it would be WebMatrix developers who would have to carry that stigma.</p>
