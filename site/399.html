            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">An interesting issue came up in the comments for my modeling post.&#xA0; Urmo is saying:  &#x2026;there are no defined processes, just individual habits (even among people with same set of obligations) with loose coupling on the points where people need to interact. In these companies a software can be a boot that kicks them into more defined and organized operating mode. This is part of discussion of software modeling and the kind of thinking you have to do when you approach a system. The problem with Urmo&#x2019;s approach is that there is a set implicit assumptions, and that is that the customer is speaking with a single voice, that they actually know what they are doing and that they have the best interests. Yes, it is really hard to create software (or anything, actually) without those, but that happens more frequently than one might desire. A few years ago I was working on a software to manage what was essentially long term temp workers. Long term could be 20 years, and frequently was a number of years. The area in question was caring for invalids,&#xA0; and most of the customers for that company were the elderly. That meant that a worker might not be required on a pretty sudden basis (the end customer died, care no longer required). Anyway, that is the back story. The actual problem we run into was that by the time the development team got into place there was already a very detailed spec, written by a pretty good analyst after many sessions at a luxury hotel conference room. In other words, the spec cost a lot of money to generate, and involved a lot of people from the company&#x2019;s management.  What it did not include, however, was feedback from the actual people who had to place the workers at particular people&#x2019;s homes, and eventually pay them for their work. Little things like the 1st of the month (you have 100s of workers coming in to get their hours approved and get paid) weren&#x2019;t taken into account. The software was very focused on the individual process, and there were a lot of checks to validate input. What wasn&#x2019;t there were things like: &#x201C;How do I efficiently handle many applicants at the same time?&#x2019;&#x27; The current process was paper form based, and they were basically going over the hours submitted, ask minimal questions, and provisionally approve it. Later on, they would do a more detailed scan of the hours, and do any fixups needed. That would be the time that they would also input the data to their old software. In other words, there was an entire messy process going on that the higher ups didn&#x2019;t even realize was happening. This include decisions such as &#x201C;you need an advance, we&#x2019;ll register that as 10 extra hours you worked this month, and we&#x2019;ll deduct it next month&#x201D; and &#x201C;you weren&#x2019;t supposed to go to Mrs. Xyz, you were supposed to go to Mr. Zabc! We can&#x2019;t pay for all your hours there&#x201D; , etc.  When we started working on the software, we happened to do a demo to some of the on site people, and they were horrified by what they saw. The new &amp; improved software would end up causing them much more issues, and it would actually result in more paperwork that they have to manage just so they can make the software happy. Modeling such things was tough, and at some point (with the client reluctant agreement) we essentially threw aside the hundreds of pages of well written spec, and just worked directly with the people who would end up using our software. The solution in the end was to codify many of the actual &#x201C;business processes&#x201D; that they were using. Those business processes made sense, and they were what kept the company working for decades. But management didn&#x2019;t actually realize that they were working in this manner. And that is leaving aside the &#x201C;let us change the corporate structure through software&#x201D; endeavors, which are unfortunately also pretty common.  To summarize, assuming that your client is a single entity, which speaks with one voice and actually know what they are talking about? Not going to fly for very long. In another case, I had to literally walk a VP of Sales through the process of how a sale is actually happening in his company versus what he thought was happening. Sometimes this job is likely playing a shrink, but for corporations.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Compression is a pretty nifty tool to have, and it can save a lot in both I/O and overall time (CPU tends to have more cycles to spare then I/O bandwidth). I decided that I wanted to investigate it more deeply.  The initial corpus was all the orders documents from the Northwind sample database. And I tested this by running GZipStream over the results.  753Kb - Without compression &#xA0; 69Kb - With compression  That is a pretty big difference between the two options. However, this is when we compress all those documents together. What happens if we want to compress each of them individually? We have 830 orders, and the result of compressing all of them individually is:  752Kb - Without compression 414Kb - With compression I did a lot of research into compression algorithms recently, and it the reason for the difference is that when we compress more data together, we can get better compression ratios. That is because compression works by removing duplication, and the more data we have, the more duplication we can find. Note that we still manage to do  What about smaller data sets? I created 10,000 records looking like this:  {&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Gloria Woods&quot;,&quot;email&quot;:&quot;gwoods@meemm.gov&quot;} And gave it the same try (compressing each entry independently):  550KB &#x2013; Without compression 715KB &#x2013; With compression The overhead of compression on small values is very significant. Just to note, compressing all entries together will result in a data size of 150Kb in size. So far, I don&#x2019;t think that I&#x2019;ve any surprising revelations. That is pretty much exactly inline with my expectations. And the reason that I&#x2019;m actually playing with compression algorithms rather than just use an off the shelve one. This particular scenario is exactly where FemtoZip is supposed to help, and that is what I am looking at now. Ideally, what I want is a shared dictionary compression that allows me to manage the dictionary myself, and doesn&#x2019;t have a static dictionary that is created once, although that seems a lot more likely to be the way we&#x2019;ll go.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just got a really interesting customer inquiry, and I got their approval to share it. The basic problem is booking flights, and how to handle that. The customer suggested something like the following: {   //customers/12345&#xA;    &quot;Name&quot; : &quot;John Doe&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;Bookings&quot; : [{&#xA;        &quot;FlightId&quot;: &quot;flights/1234&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;BookingId&quot;: &quot;1asifyupi&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;Flight&quot;: &quot;EA-4814&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;From&quot;: &quot;Iceland&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;To&quot; : &quot;Japan&quot;, &#xA;        &quot;DateBooked&quot; : &quot;2012/1/1&quot;&#xA;      }]&#xA;    }    &#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;{ // flight/1234&#xA;   &quot;PlaneId&quot;: &quot;planes/1234&quot;// centralized miles flown, service history&#xA;   &quot;Seats&quot;: &#xA;   {&#xA;       {&#xA;           &quot;Seat&quot;: &quot;F16&quot;&#xA;           &quot;BookedBy&quot;: &quot;1asifyupi&quot;&#xA;   }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But that is probably a&#x2026; suboptimal way to handle this. Let us go over the type of entities that we have here:&#xA;&#xA;Customers / Passengers &#xA;Flights&#xA;Planes&#xA;Booking&#xA;The key point in here is that each of those is pretty independent. Note that for simplicity&#x2019;s sake, I&#x2019;m assuming that the customer is also the passenger (not true in many cases, a company may pay for your flight, so you the company in the customer and you the passenger).&#xA;The actual problem the customer is dealing with is that they have thousands of flights, tens or hundreds of thousands of seats and millions of customers competing for those seats.&#xA;Let us see if we can breaking it down to a model that can work for this scenario.&#xA0; Customers deserve its own document, but I wouldn&#x2019;t store the bookings directly in the customer document. There are many customers that fly a lot, and they are going to have a lot of booking there. At the same time, there are many bookings that are made for a lot of people at the same time (an entire family flying).&#xA;That leaves the Customer&#x2019;s document with data about the customer (name, email, phone, passport #, etc) as well as details such as # of miles traveled, the frequent flyer status, etc.&#xA;Now, we have the notion of flights and bookings. A flight is a (from, to, time, plane), which contains the available seats number. Note that we need to explicitly allow for over booking, since that is a common practice for airlines.&#xA;There are several places were we have contention here:&#xA;&#xA;When ordering, we want to over book up to a certain limit.&#xA;When seating (usually 24 &#x2013; 48 hours before the flight) we want to reserve seats.&#xA;The good thing about it is that we actually have a relatively small contention on a particular flight. And the way the airline industry works, we don&#x2019;t actually need a transaction between creating the booking and taking a seat on the flight.&#xA;The usual workflows goes something like this:&#xA;&#xA;A &#x201C;reservation&#x201D; is made for a particular itinerary.&#xA;That itinerary is held for 24 &#x2013; 48 hours.&#xA;That itinerary is sent to the customer for approval.&#xA;Customer approve and a booking is made, flight reservations are turned into actual booked seats.&#xA;The good thing about this is that because a flight can have up to ~600 seats in it, we don&#x2019;t really have to worry about contention on a single flight. We can just use normal optimistic concurrency and avoid more complex models. That means that we can just retry on concurrency errors and see where that leads us. The breaking of the actual order into reservation and booking also helps, since we don&#x2019;t have to coordinate between the actual charge and the reservation on the flight.&#xA;Overbooking is handled by setting a limit of how much we allow overbooking, and managing the number of booked seats vs. reserved seats. When we look at the customer data, we show the customer document, along with the most recent orders and the stats. When we look at a particular flight, we can get pretty much all of its state from the flight document itself. &#xA;And the plane&#x2019;s stats are usually just handled via a map/reduce index on all the flights for that plane. &#xA;Now, in the real world, the situation is a bit more complex. We might give out 10 economy seats and 3 business seats to Expedia for a 2 months period, so they manage that, and we have partnership agreements with other airlines, and&#x2026; but I think that this is a good foundation to start building this on.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Take a look at the following code: int count = 0;&#xA;var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();&#xA;var tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;();   &#xA;for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;{&#xA;    var t = Task.Run(() =&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        var webRequest = WebRequest.Create(new Uri(&#x201C;http://google.com&#x201D;));        webRequest.GetResponse().Close();&#xA;        Interlocked.Increment(ref count);&#xA;    });&#xA;    tasks.Add(t);&#xA;}&#xA;var whenAll = Task.WhenAll(tasks.ToArray());&#xA;while (whenAll.IsCompleted == false &amp;&amp; whenAll.IsFaulted  == false)&#xA;{&#xA;    Thread.Sleep(1000);&#xA;    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} - {1}, {2}&quot;, sp.Elapsed, count, tasks.Count(x=&gt; x.IsCompleted == false));&#xA;}&#xA;Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, it is a pretty silly example of making 500 queries to Google. There is some stuff here about reporting &amp; managing, but the key points is that we start 500 tasks to do some I/O. How long do you think that this is going to run?&#xA;On my machine, this code completes in roughly 22 seconds. Now, WebRequest is old school, and we want to use HttpClient, because it has a much better interface, so we wrote:&#xA;int count = 0;&#xA;var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();&#xA;var tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;();&#xA;for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;{&#xA;    var t = Task.Run(() =&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        var client = new HttpClient();&#xA;        client.SendAsync(new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, new Uri(&quot;http://google.com&quot;))).Wait();&#xA; &#xA;        Interlocked.Increment(ref count);&#xA;    });&#xA;    tasks.Add(t);&#xA;}&#xA;var whenAll = Task.WhenAll(tasks.ToArray());&#xA;while (whenAll.IsCompleted == false &amp;&amp; whenAll.IsFaulted == false)&#xA;{&#xA;    Thread.Sleep(1000);&#xA;    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} - {1}, {2}&quot;, sp.Elapsed, count, tasks.Count(x =&gt; x.IsCompleted == false));&#xA;}&#xA;Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed); &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I&#x2019;ve been running this code on my machine for the past 7 minutes, and this code hasn&#x2019;t yet issue a single request.&#xA;It took a while to figure it out, but the problem is in how this is structured. We are creating a lot of tasks, more than the available threads in the thread pool. Then we make an async call, and block on that. That means that we block the thread pool thread. Which means that to process the result of this call, we&#x2019;ll need to use another thread pool thread. However, we have scheduled more tasks than we have threads for. So there is no thread available to handle the reply, so all the threads are stuck waiting for reply that there is no thread to handle to unstick them.&#xA;The thread pool notices that, and will decide to allocate more threads, but they are also taken up by the already existing tasks that will immediately block.&#xA;Now, surprisingly, eventually the thread pool will allocate enough threads (although it will take it several hours to do so, probably) to start handling the requests, and the issue is resolved. Expect that this ends up basically crippling the application while this is happening.&#xA;Obviously, the solution is to not wait on async calls inside a task like that, indeed, we can use the following code quite easily:&#xA;var t = Task.Run(async () =&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    var client = new HttpClient();&#xA;    await client.SendAsync(new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, new Uri(&quot;http://google.com&quot;)));&#xA;&#xA;    Interlocked.Increment(ref count);&#xA;});&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And this shows performance comparable to the WebRequest method.&#xA;However, that isn&#x2019;t very helpful when we need to expose a synchronous API. In our case, in RavenDB we have the IDoctumentSession, which is a simple synchronous API. We want to use the a common codebase for sync and async operations. But we need to expose the same interface, even if we changed things. To make things worse, we have no control on how the http client is scheduling the async operations, and it has no sync operations.&#xA;That means that we are left with the choice of writing everything twice, once for synchronous operations and once for async ops or just living with this issue.&#xA;A work around we managed to find is to run the root tasks (which we do control) on our own task scheduler, so they won&#x2019;t compete with the I/O operations. But that is hardly something that I am thrilled about.</p>
