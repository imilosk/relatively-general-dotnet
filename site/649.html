            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am working&#xA0; on the versioning chapter for the book, and I am current at the place where I am suggesting letting the compiler know about what kind of situations your users are likely to get into.  The examples I am using is changing the API from:     requires @vacations   To:     requires @vacations, &quot;Some explanatory text&quot;   And handling the scenario where the user attempts to write to the old API.   Here is the default approach:     BCE0017: Boo.Lang.Compiler.CompilerError: The best overload for the method &#x27;BDSLiB.QuoteGeneration.QuoteGeneratorRule.requires(string, string)&#x27; is not compatible with the argument list &#x27;(string)&#x27;.   We can use the standard [Obsolete] mechanism, like this:     [Obsolete(&quot;use requires(moduleName, explanation) instead&quot;, true)]&#xA;public void requires(string moduleName)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;throw new NotSupportedException();&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And the error would be:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#x27;BDSLiB.QuoteGeneration.QuoteGeneratorRule.requires(string)&#x27; is obsolete. use requires(moduleName, explanation) instead&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is still very scary message for non technical users. So we can up the cost a bit using this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  [Meta]&#xA;public static Expression requires(Expression moduleName)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;var message =&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;@&quot;&#xA;Requiring a module without supplying an explanation is not allowed. &#xA;Please use the following syntax:&#xA;&#x27;requires &quot; &#x2B; moduleName &#x2B; &quot;&#x27;, &#x27;&quot; &#x2B; moduleName &#x2B; &quot; is required because [add your reasoning here]&#x27;&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;CompilerContext.Current.Errors.Add(new CompilerError(moduleName.LexicalInfo, message));&#xA;&#x9;return new MethodInvocationExpression&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Target = new ReferenceExpression(&quot;requires&quot;),&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Arguments = new ExpressionCollection&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;moduleName,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new StringLiteralExpression(&quot;No explanation specified&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;};&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;In which case the error is:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  BCE0000: Boo.Lang.Compiler.CompilerError: &#xA;    Requiring a module without supplying an explanation is not allowed. &#xA;&#xA;    Please use the following syntax:&#xA;&#xA;    &#x27;requires &#x27;scheduling_work&#x27;&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;scheduling_work&#x27; is required because [add your reasoning here]&#x27;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is a much nicer message to get, I think you would agree.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Chad Myers has posted about the query objects with the repository pattern. He is trying to solve the problem of reusable pieces of queries that can be combined together. In theory, this gives you a way to compose queries in a way that hide the actual query logic. This is a good thing.  Unfortunately, the syntax leaves a lot to be desired:     _query = new TopCustomersWithLowDiscountQuery()&#xA;&#x9;.IncludePreferred();&#xA;&#xA;var otherQuery = new DeliquentCustomersQuery()&#xA;&#x9;.WithPendingLitigation()&#xA;&#x9;.WithDebtOver(999);&#xA;&#xA;var results = _customers&#xA;&#x9;.AsQueryable()&#xA;&#x9;.Where(_query.OrElse(otherQuery));&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Note how you compose the queries, that is simply unreadable as the query complexity scale up. At the same time, we don&#x27;t really have a better way of handling that since the from expression will not accept Expression&lt;T&gt; instances directly. What has me worried is the tendency toward over abstraction that I have seen in a few code bases. In particular, I have seen API that takes several Expression&lt;T&gt; objects and compose them in interesting ways. Here is an example:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  var customers = repo.FindBy(&#xA;        new TopCustomersWithLowDiscountQuery()&#xA;            .IncludePreferred()&#xA;            .BelowDiscountThreshold(3)&#xA;            .WithMoreSalesThan(500)&#xA;        .AndAlso(&#xA;            new DeliquentCustomersQuery()&#xA;                .WithDebtOver(9999))&#xA;            &#xA;);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Oh, this is a really neat trick from a programming perspective, but it makes it very hard to read and understand the code. Try to add ordering and projections to this type of query. And then try to understand the code.&#xA;&#xA;I don&#x27;t have any great solutions for that, unfortunately, but it is a problem that is worth pointing out.&#xA;&#xA;A better solution would be to integrate that with the Linq query provider to support extracting the expression tree from the query, but that is not practical as an overall solution.</p>

Over the course of an hour, we covered quite a lot of very interesting options.  The traditional drive for using cloud computing is the desire to avoid having to manage your own infrastructure, and the problems that one have to face when dealing with expanding one&#x27;s infrastructure. Being able to hand all of that to a 3rd party is a very attractive offer, especially if you feel like this 3rd party is someone that you can rely on to do better job in managing infrastructure than your own developers.  In general, developers are not IT professionals, and it shows. An additional benefit of having a 3rd party manage your infrastructure is that they tend to place limitations on the things that you do. These limitations are usually good thing, since they force you to design in a scalable manner.  Amazon&#x27;s EC2 doesn&#x27;t give you a persistence storage other than S3 and SimpleDB. This means that bringing up a new VM instance is extremely easy, and you have just increased your capacity. Same for Google&#x27;s App Engine and the limitations it has.   Of course, that is just the common motive. The competitive price of cloud computing vs. the high cost of building your own data center (or hosting your servers in someone else&#x27;s) is also a reason to move in that direction.  There are other scenarios, equally interesting, however, of using cloud computing.  Consider the case of a spike in traffic, you are running an online shop and is it a major holiday. You are likely to see a huge surge in traffic. Using your own data center would force you to build to the maximum expected capacity, which is often order of magnitude higher than your normal capacity. Using cloud computing, you can simply turn on additional instances on as needed basis.  But even that benefit was beaten to death. But what about this scenario?  You need to test your application, and as usual, it is hard to find a test environment that has 30 servers that you can try your latest version on. Setting up something like that on EC2 for a week will set you back by less than 400$.   Periodic batch processing is another issue that you might need to consider using cloud computing for. I know of several places where the need to do heavy duty processing (diamond image process for cutting machines, for example), takes quite a bit of computing power, but this is something that you can batch and do and on &quot;as needed&quot; basis, reducing your infrastructure cost significantly. Payroll is also a fairly intensive process that happens only periodically.  Another use case is to setup cloud machines as clients in a distributed load test. You can set it up so a large number of clients (a thousand machines, which you probably will not be able to do on your own) against your application.  The ability to easily perform a rolling update is also attractive, not to mention that   The picture is not so rosy when you consider that it also has some not insignificant minuses.  Broadly, there are three types of cloud services.      Google App Engine - you upload the application, and that is it. You don&#x27;t even have the concept of a machine in this system. Scalability and the distribution is solely the issue of the App Engine, not your code. This is currently limited to Python only, and the environment is modified to ensure that you can only do things the Right Way. A lot of the concerns that I intend to list are not relevant for this scenario, because you don&#x27;t have the concept of a machine. Broadly, I think that this is the way to go, and given the chance to build my own cloud computing application, I would go with a very similar concept.    Amazon EC2 - you upload a vm image, and you can start creating instances of it. The VM image can contain whatever you want, but you have no persistent storage. That means that you can&#x27;t actually save data to the local disk or run a RDBMS server. Persistent data is handled using Amazon&#x27;s web services (S3, SQS, SDB). More on that later.    GoGrid - You take an existing VM template from their site, customize it, and start running it. This is the closest that you can achieve with regards to data center in the cloud, because GoGrid&#x27;s systems behave just like real machines. That is, you don&#x27;t have to be worried about persistent storage and the like. On the one hand, it is very convenient. On the other hand, I am not sure that I like this.   The main fault that I find with Google App Engine at the moment is the limitation to Python. From all other perspectives, it is as close to the model of the ideal close service as you can get. All the infrastructure concerns has been stripped away, you only have to deal with the application concerns.  EC2 and GoGrid both allows me to setup a VM and start running it. EC2&#x27;s no persistence model means that it is much easier to scale by creating new instances and using the Amazon services to handle storage. GoGrid&#x27;s model means that I have a lot more flexibility, but with it I have the chance of major issues. In particular, it seems that it is more complex to clone a machine a hundred times than it is on EC2.  EC2 worry me somewhat, because I am not sure how it is handling such things as configuration change (remember, no persistence, on reboot, all changes to the system are wiped), and how I handles patches and updates to the system itself. Perhaps it is because I am working on Windows so often, so I worry about how to deal with Patch Tuesday, but even on the Linux images that are common on EC2, there would be a need to perform such an update. On the EC2 model, that would require getting the image, making the change locally, and uploading the image.  GoGrid, however, will allow me to perform the update in place, but by the same token, I would need to perform this update on all machines in my application.  The EC2 model means that it is very easy to bring up new instances, the GoGrid model means that it is likely to be harder, because instances are not frozen images, they are actual servers, which has state.   Other issues that would concern me in such a scenario would be load balancing, including auto discovery of failed or new instances. From a cursory check, both Amazon and GoGrid have at least rudimentary support for this, but that leaves some things to be desired. In particular, the requirements of load balancing are:     Distribute loads among a cluster of application servers.     Handle failover of an application server gracefully.     Ensure the cluster of servers appears as a single server to the end user.    A short search in the Amazon forums has raised several issues regarding load balancing in the EC2 system. It seems like the common method is to have an EC2 instance running either HA Proxy or round robin DNS deal with this. Nothing is said about what happens if that instance goes down, but I think that I can guess...  This is partially why I think that the Google App Server model is preferred. This model is explicitly an unabashedly tells you that you have no business managing the infrastructure. That is left for someone else to manage. In this case, Google. But even if you decide to build such a system on your own, dealing with infrastructure concerns should be way out of the code.  In other words, you would need to create provisioning system that look at the load, create / destroy instances, update routing information, etc. Not hard, I think, but most certainly tiresome.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeffrey Pallermo&#xA0;posted about a scenario he encountered:     I had a conversation with Kevin Hurwitz about developer tendencies.&#xA0; Kevin related a project he consulted on.&#xA0; He came in after over a million dollars had already been spent by the client, and he found the following:         Not a single feature had been delivered (save a few half-finished screens)       The team had spent all the time creating an application framework that, when finished, would make the application practically create itself.       The development manager was the one who instigated the framework frenzy, and was eventually fired.       Jeffrey then go on to suggest that this might not be the wisest use of the client&#x27;s time and money, and that it is much better to use existing tools and frameworks where they are applicable and extract frameworks when reusable pieces of work are discovered.  In general, I agree. However...  I am a fan of the &quot;build a framework to make working the application easier&quot;. The last two projects that I used this approach on had a very high ROI as a result of this. In fact, you can see one of those frameworks here.  This is especially true when we are talking about using an unfamiliar platform or usage.  Where I fully agree with Jeffrey is with the time aspect. Running for such a long time with this approach it is just unacceptable. A week or two (max) is the most that you can dedicate for speculative framework development.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that often come up in the NServiceBus mailing list is the request for an xcopy, zero administration, queuing service. This is especially the case when you have smart clients or want to have queues over the Internet.  I decided to try to build such a thing, because it didn&#x27;t seem such a hard problem. I turned out to be wrong, but it was an interesting experiment. Actually, the problem isn&#x27;t that it is hard to do this, the problem was that I wanted durable queuing, and that led me to a lot of technologies that weren&#x27;t suitable for my needs.  You can get the bits here: https://rhino-tools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rhino-tools/branches/rhino-queues-1.0  What it is:     XCopyable, Zero Administration, Embedded, Async queuing service    Robust in the face of networking outages    System.Transactions support    Fast    Works over HTTP   What it isn&#x27;t:     Durable queuing service    Wetted by production use   Broadly, using Rhino Queues you get async queues over HTTP. But, it keeps all the data in memory, so if you restart the application, it will lose all waiting messages. It also tries its best (but does not guarantee) to ensure message ordering and ensure delivery.  Let us take a look at the code, and then discuss the implementation details from there.  Server usage:     using(var factory = new Configuration(&quot;server&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.Map(&quot;server&quot;).To(&quot;http://localhost:9999/server/&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.Map(&quot;client&quot;).To(&quot;http://localhost:9999/client/&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.RegisterQueue(&quot;echo&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.BuildQueueFactory())&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;factory.Start();        using (var queue = factory.OpenQueue(&quot;echo&quot;))&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;var message = queue.Recieve();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;var str = (string)message.Value;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;var rev = new string(str.Reverse().ToArray());&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;using(var remoteQueue = factory.OpenQueue(message.Source))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Console.WriteLine(&quot;Handled message&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;remoteQueue.Send(rev);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And the client usage:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  using(var factory = new Configuration(&quot;client&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.Map(&quot;server&quot;).To(&quot;http://localhost:9999/server/&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.Map(&quot;client&quot;).To(&quot;http://localhost:9999/client/&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.RegisterQueue(&quot;echo-reply&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.BuildQueueFactory())&#xA;{&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;factory.Start();&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;using (var tx = new TransactionScope())&#xA;&#x9;using (var serverQueue = factory.OpenQueue(&quot;echo@server&quot;))&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Console.WriteLine(&quot;Sending &#x27;hello there&#x27;&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;serverQueue.Send(&quot;Hello there&quot;).Source = new Destination(&quot;echo-reply@client&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;tx.Complete();&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;using (var clientQueue = factory.OpenQueue(&quot;echo-reply&quot;))&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;var msgText = clientQueue.Recieve();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Console.WriteLine(msgText.Value);&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, we map a nice name to an endpoint, so we can send message to [queue]@[endpoint nice name], sending a message to just [queue] send it to the local machine. It is expected that the nice name for an endpoint would be the machine name, which alleviate the need of syncing names across all endpoints.&#xA;&#xA;You can also see the usage of System.Transaction and without System.Transactions.&#xA;&#xA;One thing that would probably raise questions is why Rhino Queues doesn&#x27;t have a durable mode, after all, I just spent some time building a durable queue infrastructure. The reason for that is very simple, I spent too much time on that, and I can&#x27;t spend more time on this at the moment. So I am putting both Rhino Queues and Rhino Queues Storage Disk out there, and I&#x27;ll let the community bring them together.&#xA;&#xA;A word of warning, Rhino Queues is a cool project, but it is not a replacement for such things as MSMQ. If you can, you probably want to make use of MSMQ, specifically because there is a lot more production time using it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The first thing you should know, the code for this is here: https://rhino-tools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rhino-tools/experiments/Rhino.Queues.Storage.Disk  After my disastrous attempt to get an off the shelf embedded storage that can actually handle multiple threads with a half way decent performance, I decided that I really have to write my own.  I am pointing this out to all the people who think that my first instinct is to write my own.&#xA0; Here is the API that it has:     using (var queue = new PersistentQueue(path))&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;using (var session = queue.OpenSession())&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;session.Enqueue(new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 });&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;session.Flush();&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;using (var session = queue.OpenSession())&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;CollectionAssert.AreEqual(new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, session.Dequeue());&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;session.Flush();&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If it reminds you of something, that is intentional. :-)&#xA;&#xA;Persistent Queue is a singleton, which allow you to create sessions, which are thread local and contain the API to Enqueue and Dequeue from the queue. You can see the Flush() call there. This call persist the actual enqueuing or dequeuing. Our changes will revert if we will not call it.&#xA;&#xA;On of the design decisions that I wanted for this project was transaction support. That is, it should support ACID. This is not a trivial matter to decide to implement, but I decided that I wanted to try it.&#xA;&#xA;Let me describe how it works. The persistent queue is using three types of files:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  Transaction log&#xA;&#xA;  Data files&#xA;&#xA;  Lock file&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The data file is a simply where I place the data from the user, nothing more. Basically, here is how it looks:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;There are several optimizations in the way that I write to the data file. First, writing is always done in sequential manner, and no editing of the file is ever done. That is, once something is on the file, it is never touched (except for read, of course). This allow to maintain a very high performance when writing to file. Combining writes and deciding when to use async I/O vs. sync I/O also has a significant implication.&#xA;&#xA;Of course, because I never edit the file, I need some way to deal with data overflow. Once the file exceed a predefined limit, I stop writing to it and start writing to a new file. Once all the items has been read from a file, and no more can be written to it, I delete it. This is a very simple strategy for managing the actual data. In fact, we use the current file size to size the next file, hopefully avoiding fragmentation this way, by simple heuristics.&#xA;&#xA;Of course, writing the data to disk is only half the problem. We need to manage that as well. For that, I have the transaction log. Because I have an extremely simple set of operations (Enqueue and Dequeue), it is very easy to deal with it. Here is a view of the transaction log:&#xA0;  &#xA;&#xA;The model is simple, each transaction is composed of a set of operations, and each operation contains the data in . When we commit a transaction, we wait for all write operation to complete, and then we append this data to the transaction log. The fact that we are only ever append to the transaction log also pay off in terms of how fast sequential writes are. Periodically and on graceful shutdown, we trim the transaction log, leaving only Enqueue operations there. &#xA;&#xA;This, in turn, allow us to restore ourselves in the case of an error. &#xA;&#xA;All writes to the disk are done with WriteThrough enabled, so we touch the platter, and writing to the transaction log is protected using a strategy similar to the one described here, so it can either succeed or fail.&#xA;&#xA;A lot of the complexity is simplified by serializing all writes to the disk. This has some implications in terms of the concurrency, but it is alleviated by using async I/O when it is appropriated. Overall performance is actually better in this scenario, because we are reduce the amount of seeks the disk has to do.&#xA;&#xA;Let me try to work through the ACID components and see if this works. &#xA;&#xA;Atomicity&#xA;&#xA;We should either complete succeed or completely fail. Let us assume that we have an error midway through a transaction. We have several options:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  The system has already written the transaction an all its operations to the disk, in which case we consider this a successful transaction.&#xA;&#xA;  No data was written to the transaction log about all the entries added / removed in this transaction, in which case, the transaction never actually occurred, so we are back to completely failed.&#xA;&#xA;  The most problematic part is handling partial transaction data written to the disk. Note that we have a count on the transaction log telling us how many operations to expect? We are using this to verify that the transaction has been successfully written to the disk. If we find a partially complete transaction, we ignore it and fix the transaction log. As far as we are concerned, the transaction never happened.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Since we use WriteThrough, we can be sure that when we finish a write, it is on the disk itself, and we will not loss it in case of a system crash.&#xA;&#xA;Note that there is one side affect of failed transactions, we do not recover disk space that went for data in lost transactions. This mean that if you written a 1MB chunk, then rolled the transaction back, that data file will not reclaim that MB of space that was lost. This is intentional, since it appears that it is actually more costly to perform the bookkeeping than merely lose the space temporarily.&#xA;&#xA;Consistency&#xA;&#xA;Will work with the guarantees that we have in place for atomicity.&#xA;&#xA;Isolation&#xA;&#xA;We only add the newly enqueued items to the global list (and the transaction log) when the transaction is committed. Dequeuing items, however, remove them from the global list and put them on hold, if the transaction is rolled back they return to the front of the queue, if the transaction is committed, their removal is logged to the transaction log.&#xA;&#xA;Durability&#xA;&#xA;All data is written to disk without buffers, so when the data write is complete, so we can ensure that a system failure will not wipe it. &#xA;&#xA;And that is how I implemented ACID for a system that has only two actions. But there was another challenge.&#xA;&#xA;Performance&#xA;&#xA;As you probably noticed, I put a lot of thought into performance. In particular, write batching and read ahead were important factors in significantly improving the performance of the system.&#xA;&#xA;Right now, the situation is good enough that I include the Performance Tests as part of the Unit Tests of the application. Those unit tests include several tests that read and write millions of items, and the total test suite completes in ~80 seconds.&#xA;&#xA;Below you can the profiler output of such a run. There are two things to note here, first, the amount of time spent calling to disk, and the number of calls that were made to the disk. I have put a lot of effort in minimizing the number of calls as much as possible, and it shows in the tests performance.&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Scale&#xA;&#xA;I tested this with 5,000 items of 512Kb - 1Mb in size, both read and write. The test completed within 5 minutes, giving us a roughly 12 MB/s processing time for a single queue.&#xA;&#xA;I think that this is enough for now, feel free to go through the code and rip it to pieces :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">You have the no-failure, everything completed successfully and everyone is happy.    You have complete-failure, someone just pull the power cord off the machine.    And in the middle, you have partial-failure, something bad happened, (network is down, someone pulled the USB key out) but the system can (and should) keep running.    Most people give up on the complete failure scenario, leaving that up to transactional storage to handle this. That is usually the smartest solution.   The problem occur with partial failure, where you need to recover in meaningful ways. It is actually very easy to write a system where a complete failure is better than a partial failure.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">No, I am not talking about Jeremey Miller&#x27;s reversibility. I am talking about another matter all together. I have an API that perform an operation. The problem is that based on the result of this operation, I may need to cancel that operation.   The main issue here is that in order to reverse this operation, I need to expose too much information to the client, which I rather not do. Let us take the following interface as an example:     public interface IActionStack&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;ActionSpec Pop();&#xA;&#x9;void Push(ActionSpec action);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The code I would like to write is something like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  while(true)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;var action = actionStack.Pop();&#xA;&#x9;if (action.ExecuteAt &gt;= DateTime.Now )&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;action.Execute();&#xA;&#x9;else&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;actionStack.Push(action);&#xA;&#x9;Thread.Sleep(1000);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But there is meaning to the order of items in the stack, so I can just reorder it. Peek or PushFirst are not applicable here. What I came up with was:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  public interface IActionStack &#xA;{ &#xA;&#x9;ActionSpec Pop(); &#xA;&#x9;ActionSpec ReversiblePop(out System.Action reversePop); &#xA;&#x9;void Push(ActionSpec action); &#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And the client code is:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  while(true)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;System.Action reverse;&#xA;&#x9;var action = actionStack.ReversiblePop(out reverse);&#xA;&#x9;if (action.ExecuteAt &gt;= DateTime.Now )&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;action.Execute();&#xA;&#x9;else&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;reverse();&#xA;&#x9;Thread.Sleep(1000);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Thoughts?</p>
