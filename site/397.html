            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Kelly has an interesting post about memory mapped files and the cloud. This is in response to a comment on my post where I stated that we don&#x2019;t reserve space up front in Voron because we&#xA0; support cloud providers that charge per storage. From Kelly&#x2019;s post, I assume she thinks about running it herself on her own cloud instances, and that is what here pricing indicates. Indeed, if you want to get a 100GB cloud disk from pretty much anywhere, you&#x2019;ll pay for the full 100GB disk from day 1. But that isn&#x2019;t the scenario that I actually had in mind. I was thinking about the cloud providers. Imagine that you want to go to RavenHQ, and get a db there. You sigh up for a 2 GB plan, and all if great. Except that on the very first write, we allocate a fixed 10 GB, and you start paying overage charges. This isn&#x2019;t what you pay when you run on your own hardware. This is what you would have to deal with as a cloud DBaaS provider, and as a consumer of such a service. That aside, let me deal a bit with the issues of memory mapped files &amp; sparse files. I created 6 sparse files, each of them 128GB in size in my E drive.  As you can see, this is a 300GB disk, but I just &#x201C;allocated&#x201D; 640GB of space in it.   This also shows that there has been no reservation of space on the disk. In fact, it is entirely possible to create files that are entirely too big for the volume they are located on.  I did a lot of testing with mmap files &amp; sparseness, and I came to the conclusion that you can&#x2019;t trust it. You especially can&#x2019;t trust it in a cloud scenario. But why? Well, imagine the scenario where you need to use a new page, and the FS needs to allocate one for you. At this point, it need to find an available page. That might fail, let us imagine that this fails because of no free space, because that is easiest. What happens then? Well, you aren&#x2019;t access things via an API, so there isn&#x2019;t an error code it can return, or an exception to be thrown. In Windows, it will use Standard Exception Handler to throw the error. In Linux, that will be probably generate a SIVXXX error. Now, to make things interesting, this may not actually happen when you are writing to the newly reserved page, it may be deferred by the OS to a later point in time (or if you call msync / FlushViewOfFile).&#xA0; At any rate, that means that at some point the OS is going to wake up and realize that it promised something it can&#x2019;t deliver, and in that point (which, again, may be later than the point you actually wrote to that page) you are going to find yourself in a very interesting situation. I&#x2019;ve actually tested that scenario, and it isn&#x2019;t a good one form the point of view of reliability. You really don&#x2019;t want to get there, because then all bets are off with regards to what happens to the data you wrote. And you can&#x2019;t even do graceful error handling at that point, because you might be past the point. Considering the fact that disk full is one of those things that you really need to be aware about, you can&#x2019;t really trust this intersection of features.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is more of less how a page is represented in memory.  There are a few things to note. The entries immediately following the page header points to the actual data at the end of the page. Why is that? Well, remember that we are working with a fixed size page. And we need to add data to the page in a sorted fashion, and do this cheaply. In order to do that, we always add the actual data at the end of the file, before any other data. When the page is empty, we add the value in the end. And the next value is immediately before the previous value, etc. However, as you can see in the image, the fact that we add values in a particular order doesn&#x2019;t mean that they are sorted in that order. In order to get good sorting, we keep a list of the entries offsets in the beginning of the page, just after the header. This is a sorted list, which gives us the ability to easy add / move an item in the page without actually moving the page, just by changing the offset position it is located on. If we would add another entry to this page, with the key C, the actual data would go on top of entry# 3. But the offset recording this entry would go between B &amp; A at the head of the page.  In other words, the actual data of the page grows upward, and the offsets pointing to the locations of entries in the page grows downward. A page is full when you can&#x2019;t fit the next data item and its offset in the space between the data &amp; the offsets. So that is addition. How about deletion. When we delete, we need to recover the space, but that is actually very easy to handle. Let us say that we want to delete the A entry. That means that we need to do the following. Move all the higher entries data downward to cover the space taken by the entry, and then update the offsets to reflect that. In the end, we are left with:  Updates work as a pair of delete/add operations, with some important edge cases. What happen if we have a page that is nearly full, and we want to update an entry that is bigger than it can currently hold? We have to check if the value is also too big if the previous value is removed. If not, we can fit it into the currently page. Otherwise, we would have to do a page split to accommodate it. Surprisingly enough, the code that is required to handle that is quite pretty, although the actual mechanism probably require a whiteboard to explain. And a lot of hand waving.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I gave a brief introduction about B&#x2B;Trees. Now I want to talk about a crucial part of handling them. Let us start with the basic, we have the following tree, which consist of a single page:  As you can imagine, attempting to add a single item to this page isn&#x2019;t going to happen (there isn&#x2019;t enough space), so we are going to have to something about it. That something is call page splitting. The easiest way to do that is to simply cut things in half, like so:  We have split the page, and now we are left with two pages that we can start writing to. Everyone is happy. Almost&#x2026; in this case, you can see that we are doing sequential inserts. So page #0 is never going to have any additional data written to it. That means that we are wasting half this page!   What I have done is to add just a tiny bit of smarts into the mix. Instead of doing a 50/50 split, we can detect if this is a sequential insert that is causing the split. If it is, we are going to split the data in a way that put more of it in the original page, like so:  We leave 85% of the data in the original page because that give some room to play with if one of the entries change there. This gives us a better page utilization in the common case of sequential inserts. But what about non sequential inserts? Well, if we detect that the page is being split because of a non sequential insert, we are going to do a 50/50 split, expecting that there would be additional non sequential inserts along the way. I am not sure how useful that would be, but it seems like something that could be a nice optimization for a common case, and it requires nothing else from the user, we can do it all on our own.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The second item to go over with the World&#x2019;s smallest No SQL database is about persistence, and following that, I/O. Right now, there is no persistence. If you restart the process, all the data is gone. Now, there are actually quite a few real world dbs that behave in this fashion. But they are a rarity. For the most part, if I put data inside a db, I expect it to be there until I do something about it. And at that point, you are in for quite a bit of complexity. How are you going to persist the data? The easiest way to do it, just create a file per every value in the db is going to be&#x2026; problematic on most systems. So you need to put a lot of data in a small set of files. Which means that you have to decide how you are going to put the data together. In general, there is either the fixed size option, in which you divide the file(s) into pages and work around that. The good thing about this is that this gives you the ability to reuse space in the file after deletes / updates. The bad thing about that is that it is quite complex. Alternatively, you can just write the data out as needed, but then you can&#x2019;t really update written data, and would need to run compactions. And we haven&#x2019;t talked about searching yet. Some DBs, like Bitcask / Munin, would actually store the keys in memory, and store the position on the disk for retrieving the value. But for the most part, both keys &amp; values tend to be on disk in some form. In CouchDB, they are held inside an append only B&#x2B;Tree. In LevelDB, they are held in Sorted String Tables. LMDB uses Copy-On-Write B&#x2B;Tree. Esent use a B&#x2B;Tree with a Log file.  In each of those cases, the actual semantics for persistent data involve at least two concerns. You need to actually be able to search the data (that usually mean more than just O(1) access, you want to be able to go back &amp; forth on the keys) and you need to be able to do a transactional save. This is so you can recover&#xA0; in case of a crash, most of the time. But there are actually a lot more that goes into the selection of the proper persistence format. To start with, how you store the data on disk will have a big effect on your performance. If you store the data as a linked list, for example, you might as well kiss your performance goodbye. Beyond that, we also have issues with things like how is the format going to scale when we have concurrent readers. For example, if you have something that does a lot of seeks, and rely on the seeks always going forward to ensure performance, that is going to be very badly hit the moment that you have concurrent readers doing concurrent reads on different parts of the system. You would be forcing the system to do random seeks.  There are other considerations, as well. For example, if you are using something like B&#x2B;Tree, it is likely that you&#x2019;ll be overwriting the same section on the disk multiple times. That is fine with HDD, but SSD would just give up &amp; die on you at some point. And we haven&#x2019;t started talking about secondary indexes yet&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that I enjoy about learning new things is the way it changes the way I look at the stuff that I already knows. Reading the LMDB codebase, and implementing a persistent B&#x2B;Tree has given me a new depth of understanding about how relational databases (and Esent, too), work. I am going to go back to level zero and assume that you have never heard about this. You probably know what a binary search tree is. And you know how they work. Here is such a tree:  Most tree algorithms spend a lot of time ensuring that the trees are balanced, because their most important property, O(log N) search performance, require that.&#xA0; Binary search trees seems ideally suitable for building databases ,since they allow speedy lookups and backward &amp; forward iteration through the data. Unfortunately, they suffer from a pretty crippling limitation. They have absolutely horrible performance when used in persistent medium. Let us assume that I have a file that contains the following information (Key, Left offset, Right offset). I could search through that file by just walking the links. That, however, would result quite terrible performance. Every time that we move between nodes, we have to do a seek, and that would kill any benefits we will gain from using binary search tree. Instead, we have a data structure that is aimed at reducing those costs. B&#x2B;Tree. On the face of it, B&#x2B;Tree is a truly stupidly simple idea. Instead of having just 2 items in the tree, left &amp; right, let us have more. Now, since B&#x2B;Trees are usually used in persistent format, we start out by defining pages. That is because if we want to do random I/O, we have to be able to write in pages to the file. Therefor, we usually talk about B&#x2B;Trees in terms of pages. Here is the above tree, rendered as a B&#x2B;Tree:  Since the data is small, it all fits into a single page. That means that you can read the entire page into memory, and then do a binary search on the data page cheaply. The page above uses a page size of 4,096, so it can contain about 200 entries (of the size we just put in, which are very small). What happens when we have more than that? We Split the page. The resulting data now looks like this (256 entries):  Now, if we want to do a search for key 152, we start by reading the root node, we can see that the page containing values greater than 102 is page 1, so we will go there. We read that, and do a binary search on the data to find our value. So that was two seeks to get the data. Instead of eight. And usually, the high level pages are already cached, so we would only need a single seek.&#xA0;  Let us see what happens when we put even more data in (512):  As you can see, we doubled the amount of information we store, but we remain at the same height. That is quite important, in order to get good performance from&#xA0; the disk. The usual fan out is about a 100, depending on your page size and the keys you selected. I played with the settings a a bit so you can get a good idea about what this look like when you have some more depth, I wrote the following code:     1: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 32; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   2: {   3:     ms.Position = 0;   4:     for (int j = 0; j &lt; 32; j&#x2B;&#x2B;)   5:     {   6:         env.Root.Add(tx, string.Format(&quot;{0,5}&quot;, i&#x2B;j), ms);   7:     }   8: }&#xA;Which resulted in the following tree:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;So far, so good, but this is actually the best case scenario. This is what happens when we are inserting data in a sequential manner. Let us mix things up a bit, okay? &#xA;&#xA;   1: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   2: {   3:     ms.Position = 0;   4:     for (int j = 0; j &lt; 4; j&#x2B;&#x2B;)   5:     {   6:         env.Root.Add(tx, string.Format(&quot;{1,5}-{0,5}&quot;, i, j), ms);   7:     }   8: }&#xA;This code will generate values in effectively a random fashion, and you can see the impact it has on the tree:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;What happens is that we have had to insert data in a lot of places, which resulted in a lot of page splits, which increase the depth of the tree. Deeper trees means more operations required to actually get to the data on the leaf nodes. And yes, if you have a flash back to &#x201C;always use sequential ids&#x201D; section in RDMBS class, this is the reason why. &#xA;Now, I think that this is enough for now, I&#x2019;ll do some more talking about the subject in my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post I started to talk about the architecture of Naver. But this is actually still too early to tell, since before anything else, I want to create the low level interface for working with pages. And even before that, I had to decide how to actually represent a page in C#. In LMDB, this is easy because you can just access the memory using a pointer, and work with memory in this fashion is really natural in C. But in C#, that is much harder. It took me some trial and error, but I realize that I was trying to write C code in C#, and that isn&#x2019;t going to work. Instead, I have to write native C#, which is similar, but different. In C, I can just pass around a pointer, and start doing evil things to it at will. In C#, there are a lot of road blocks along the way that prevent you from doing that.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;So I ended up with this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   1: [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit, Pack = 1)]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   2: public struct PageHeader&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   3: {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   4:     [FieldOffset(0)]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   5:     public int PageNumber;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   6:     [FieldOffset(4)]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   7:     public PageFlags Flags;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   8:&#xA0; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   9:     [FieldOffset(5)]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  10:     public ushort Lower;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  11:     [FieldOffset(7)]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  12:     public ushort Upper;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  13:&#xA0; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  14:     [FieldOffset(5)]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  15:     public int NumberOfPages;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  16: }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This is the memory layout that I want. But, there is not way in C# to say, allocate this struct at this location. Luckily, I found a workaround.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   1: public unsafe class Page&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   2: {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   3:     private readonly byte* _base;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   4:     private readonly PageHeader* _header;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   5:&#xA0; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   6:     public Page(byte* b)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   7:     {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   8:         _base = b;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   9:         _header = (PageHeader*)b;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  10:     }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  11:&#xA0; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  12:     public int PageNumber { get { return _header-&gt;PageNumber; } set { _header-&gt;PageNumber = value; } }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;What I can do, I can have a Page class that manage this for me. This means that I just give the class a pointer, and it can treat this either as a PageHeader* or as a byte array. This means that I also get to do cool tricks like having an array backed by memory directly in the code:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   1: public ushort* KeysOffsets&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   2: {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   3:     get { return (ushort*)(_base &#x2B; Constants.PageHeaderSize); }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   4: }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The Page class have a lot of methods relating to managing the page itself, and it should abstract away all the pesky details of actually working with memory directly.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;So, this isn&#x2019;t a really informative post, I fear. But it did take me a few hours to come up with the approach that I wanted. I kept trying to find ways to embed addresses inside the PageHeader, until I realized that I can just hold that externally. Note that all the important state about the Page is actually stored in memory outside the Page class, so that is shared globally, but you can have two Page instances that point to the same place. And that is where I decided to put local state. Things like where we are currently positioned in the page, for example.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am currently playing around with persistent B&#x2B;Trees. This is done using memory mapped files and pointer arithmetic in C#. I consider this a non trivial exercise,&#xA0; and certainly quite outside of my usual haunts. Obviously, as you can imagine, there are bugs. Those can be really pretty hard to figure out, because they can arise from any number of issues (usually it is me, but still&#x2026;). After fighting for a few hours with a set of bus that just wouldn&#x2019;t let me be, I decided that I had enough of that and set out to design the debug hooks I need to actually figure it out. Because I am dealing with pointers, I couldn&#x2019;t just use the normal methods that I would use when debugging C# code. To top that, I think that most of you would agree that explaining a data structure (any data structure) without a whiteboard is nigh impossible. In the same manner, trying to figure out a bug in a B&#x2B;Tree by following the member references was too hard. I wanted to actually visualize that. I could throw it into a TreeView in a few minutes, but I wanted to take the time and do it right. I have a feeling that this is going to be useful for the future as well, so I learned how to use Graphviz&#x2019;s dot language and wrote the code to dump the structure of the B&#x2B;Tree into a properly formatted dot file, after which I could ask dot.exe to turn that into an image. The piece of code that I was having trouble with was the page split function. Here is the before snapshot, note that we have nearly run out of room in this page.  And here is the output of the after snapshot. As you can see, this really make no sense at all. We have a page split, but it all went into the same page?       What actually happened is that I had a bug where I wired both the left and right pages in the split to the original page. Once that was fixed (and one I actually saw the data, it was very easy to see what is wrong). It was a matter of changing a single parameter. After the fix, I could visually see that everything was fine.  Leaving aside the details about the actual bug &amp; fix. The lesson that I wish to impart today is that building those sort of capabilities into your systems is important. Now that I have this ability, I fully expect to be starting to using that when I need to debug the next issue. In fact, I run into the next issue quite quickly. After inserting quite a lot of data, I messed up the pointers and returned what looked very much like corrupted data. It was pretty hard to isolate, as usual with pointer issues, since the actual error occurred at some point during the process, I wasn&#x2019;t really clear on where and how to figure it out. I ended up just dumping the tree content to a file after every operation, and then checking the operations until I found the one where we start to have corruption. That allowed me to figure out that the corruption began at step 98 iteration #4.   As it turned out, that was pretty hard to figure out, because I didn&#x2019;t realize that when I was splitting the page, I needed to compact the data on the original page. Too much thinking in List&lt;T&gt; and not enough thinking about the layout of the problem in memory.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">What is Voron? Well, it is a joke, but I&#x2019;ll leave it for someone else to explain.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Voron is the codename for our next generation storage engine, it is a managed port of LMDB, with some tweaks that we added on. The basic idea is that we will have our own storage solution based on our own code that we fully control.&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Voron is different than LMDB in a few details, mostly:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Only single process (multiple process can read, but only one process can write, and we don&#x2019;t really care about multi process reads).&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;No duplicates (LMDB allows them, we have no need for them yet, so we didn&#x2019;t do that).&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Support for increasing the file size (LMDB doesn&#x2019;t support it, but we need to, so we added support for it).&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Pure mmap access to the data (we don&#x2019;t do manual I/O writes).&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Early testing shows that for read speeds, we really couldn&#x2019;t ask for anything else. For write speed, we are good, but aren&#x2019;t as good as we would like it to be.&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Personally, I think that the codebase is a lot easier to follow, but I wrote it, so&#x2026; It isn&#x2019;t ready yet for public consumption, but I would like to share it with a few people. So here is the deal.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I am looking for people to join the alpha program for it. Like with RavenDB at its early stage, I am looking for commitment to do something for the project. It can be anything from testing it out and submitting failing scenarios to actually working on the code to building small scale proofs on it, etc.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;What I am not interested is viewers. There will be time enough for that at a later point in time. What I am looking for right now is contributors. And I think that this is a really cool project to be a part of. If you want to join, please ping via email.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Since MMMD appears to be an airport in Mexico, I think that I&#x2019;ll call this project Nevar Voron. It seems&#x2026; appropriate, somehow.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I don&#x2019;t learn by just reading code, I really need to do some writing to actually understand the concepts. In order to do that, I decided to try to create a managed implementation based on the ideas from LMDB. Note that I explicitly don&#x2019;t try to do a port, I am trying to do something different, but based on the concepts that I learned from reading the code.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Goals:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Single process only &#x2013; I have no need to do something that can be used by multiple processes.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;No predefined file size &#x2013; The reason LMDB does this is that it maps the entire file as a single continuous range. But there isn&#x2019;t really any reason why you can grow the file and map the extra space in a different location.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Multiple trees (&#x201C;tables&#x201D;) &#x2013; So we don&#x2019;t have just a single B-Tree, we can have more than one. I won&#x2019;t have a main DB exposed outside.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ACID, Transactional, MVCC with single writer&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;No File I/O &#x2013; In LMDB, the code allows either standard file I/O or direct memory writes. The later is dangerous if you are using C, because you can overwrite and corrupt data, but in .NET, that isn&#x2019;t an issue, since we don&#x2019;t do direct memory access.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;No duplicates &#x2013; It really complicates the LMDB codebase, and I don&#x2019;t think it is really needed.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Overall architecture:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;One of the reasons I explicitly not trying to do a port is that I still don&#x2019;t like the LMDB codebase. I think that it require a major refactoring, and the way it works is not really suitable for a managed implementation. The first major component is going to be the B-Tree. This is responsible for reading &amp; writing data from a memory mapped file region. But it is focused only on that. Things like transactions, page allocations, free pages, concurrency and anything else is the responsibility of others. This is important because B-Tree is going to be useful for a lot of stuff. In LMDB, the B&#x2B;Tree is used to maintain the free list, the main db, sub databases, etc. For that matter, just having a persistent B&#x2B;Tree is going to be very useful in general.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;After going away and playing with the code for a while, I can tell you that you need the following just to get started:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Page &#x2013; represent a page in memory, of course. A page is a sorted list of items, where item can be a value or a reference to another page.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Tree &#x2013; the actual tree implementation, responsible for such things as maintaining the tree, reads &amp; searches. The only outside dependency it has is on Transaction, and that is only when it needs to allocate a pages.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Transaction &#x2013; manages transactions, either read only or write. Handles page allocations. This one isn&#x2019;t even started, because I want to see how far I can take the tree code before I need to actually complete it.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The basic idea is, I really like the ideas that LMDB uses, I just don&#x2019;t like the codebase. So I want to see if I can do the same thing with a codebase that would be easier for me to work with.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And, of course, this is a cool project and quite interesting one.</p>
