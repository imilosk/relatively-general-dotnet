            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A fa&#xE7;ade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.  More about this pattern. The intent of the fa&#xE7;ade was good: to wrap APIs that are poorly designed in something shiny and nice. In the real world, however, it is an evil pattern that is used to needlessly add abstractions for no particular reason. For example, look at this article. &#xA0; That sound you just heard is your architecture, it is hiding in the closet, weeping silent tears about emotional and physical abuse that just doesn&#x2019;t end. I have yet to see a real case were fa&#xE7;ade was actually used properly. In most cases, people built a fa&#xE7;ade because That Is How We Do Things. And because of that, they ended up with things like the one above. It adds exactly nothing, and it horrifyingly complicates the code. Recommendation: Avoid this, you really don&#x2019;t need to do this most of the time, and most implementations are bad.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just got this from a customer, and I think that it is a great story:  Hi Oren,  I thought you might be interested in a little success story!  At the beginning of the year we began pre-financing a pepper factory in the [redacted]. In order to control the money that we were sending to the factory I created a little Excel spread sheet to keep a record of the payments that we were making. However, some payments were made directly from our head office to the factory, and some were made to us in [redacted] which we in turn transferred to the factory. So I added a few more columns to the spread sheet to record this.  However, the repayment calculations are different depending on whether we make the payment in [redacted] or whether it comes from head office. So I added a few more columns to the spread sheet to calculate this. When the money arrives in [redacted], we need to sell the USD at the Central Bank and convert them into [redacted]. So I added a few more columns to the spread sheet to record this.  However, some of the payments that we are transferring to the factory are from money that we borrow locally in [redacted]. So I added a few more columns to record this.&#xA0; The spread sheet is getting quite big now &#x2013; we&#x2019;re at about 30 columns and there&#x2019;s a lot of horizontal scrolling going on. However, we&#x2019;ve only done about 10 operations, so there are only 10 rows. No big deal if we have to scroll around a bit.  Now the factory has started to receive the product which we paid for in advance. Good idea if I add a column to record this. Shit &#x2013; every five minutes, someone comes to me and asks me to add another column for something or other.  OK &#x2013; these are all distinct operations. When the factory starts to ship out the goods, the first page of the spread sheet is at 45 columns, so I now create a new page in the spread sheet to control the shipments as we receive them. Hmm &#x2013; another 30 columns appear &#x2013; of which about a third of them are just references to the first page, and the rest new data.  Now I realize that it would be nice to control our margin on the entire operation. The spread sheet is shared on SkyDrive so that our offices in [redacted] and [redacted], our accountants, our lawyers, the factory and the freight forwarder can see what is going on. However, I can&#x2019;t allow all of these people to see information about our margins, so I create a new hidden page in the spread sheet.  Boy are we successful &#x2013; we&#x2019;ve now done 50 operations. Can&#x2019;t see the column or row headers any more. No worries, just freeze the columns/headers. Wait a minute &#x2013; who the hell copied and pasted the formulas to the new rows? The numbers aren&#x2019;t adding up any more. Duh &#x2013; why did you put the number for the currency contract in against contract 1234 &#x2013; it should have gone against 1235??  Now, I don&#x2019;t want to touch the spread sheet any more for fear of breaking something.  Business is great. We&#x2019;ve finally nailed how to run pre financing operations for pepper factories in [redacted]. We decide to expand our business, and start working with another factory. Since the data in the spread sheet has to be visible to the factory, I create a new spread sheet. However, some of the requirements are slightly different, so it has different columns to the first one.  Our spread sheet is now 85 columns and 60 rows, and the other one is 78 columns and 7 rows.&#xA0; Since the second spread sheet &#x201C;looks&#x201D; almost identical to the first spread sheet &#x2013; yup &#x2013; you guessed it - someone puts information into the wrong spread sheet!  Crisis point &#x2013; we&#x2019;ve got about [redacted, but in the millions US$] out in the field, and we can&#x2019;t work out where the hell the money is &#x2013; are the goods with the farmer, are they at the factory, are they at the port, are they already on board the vessel,&#xA0; has the vessel already left? Have we paid for them, if not, when do we need to pay for them?  All the data is in the spread sheet, but only one person in the entire company really understands it&#xA0; (I just wrote it &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t put the data in). So if I want to know something it&#x2019;s a scream over the desk &#x2013; &#x201C;Jonathan where the **** are the goods we were supposed to ship last week?&#x201D; Jonathan goes on holiday for three weeks.  [redacted] pepper production stops, while Jonathan is going up the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Even at this point &#x2013; if you can believe this &#x2013; I was waiting for him to come back so that we could continue operations.  I&#x2019;ve had enough of this &#x2013; RavenDB to the rescue! Two &#x2013; let me repeat that &#x2013; TWO - hours later, I&#x2019;ve written the scripts to read the spread sheet(s) and throw them into one document &#x2013; I&#x2019;ll repeat that again &#x2013; ONE document.&#xA0;  The document is nicely partitioned into logical groups &#x2013; i.e. classes for Payments, Currency contracts, Shipments etc. There is also a separate class that only does the calculations between the different logical groups. But all of this is stored in one document only. Since the calculations are all obviously read only, the results get persisted to the document.  Two indexes which give me all the information I need to control where the money is, where the stocks are. Three days to write the front end &#x2013; it only took that long because I&#x2019;m still learning MVC and javascript (I really wanted to use Backbone, but just couldn&#x2019;t get my head around it).  In the first analysis of the new application I found [redacted, hundreds of thousands US$] that we had been paid 30 days ago, that we had not sent to the factory, and was lying at the bank!  Now this is where it gets pretty amazing (for me at least). Our data is nicely partitioned, four pages that are simply different views onto the same data. The guys are getting all excited &#x2013; hey I want to control whether we paid the lawyer etc. Someone notices that some of the calculations are not correct &#x2013; so much for my edge case tests!  So I add a couple of new properties to the document, create a three line foreach loop to read all the data in the database and save it straight back again, and voila &#x2013; I&#x2019;ve &#x201C;patched&#x201D; the database. Migrations, shmigrations&#xA0; - who needs them! All the calculations are updated and stored back in the database, the new properties all appear. And this is all on live data. The minute I&#x2019;d got the raw data from the spread sheet into the database we stopped using Excel. And that made my day.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behaviour to be added to an existing object dynamically.  More about this pattern. I don&#x2019;t have a lot to say about this pattern.  The decorator pattern is still just as useful if not more so as the time it was initially announced. It forms a core part of many critical function of your day to day software. The most obvious example is the notion of Stream, where you often decorate a stream (Buffered Stream, Compressing Stream, etc). This example is valid not just for the .NET framework, I can&#x2019;t think of a single major framework that doesn&#x2019;t use the Stream abstraction for its IO. Then again, the cautionary side, people try to use it in&#x2026; strange ways:      1: public abstract class CondimentDecorator : Beverage {}   2:&#xA0;    3: public class Mocha : CondimentDecorator   4: {   5:     private Beverage m_beverage;   6:&#xA0;    7:     public Mocha(Beverage beverage)   8:     {   9:         this.m_beverage = beverage;  10:     }  11:&#xA0;   12:     public override String Description  13:     {  14:         get  15:         {  16:             return m_beverage.Description &#x2B; &quot;, Mocha&quot;;  17:         }  18:     }  19:&#xA0;   20:     public override double Cost()                 21:     {                                        22:         return 0.20 &#x2B; m_beverage.Cost();  23:     }  24: }&#xA;Something like this, for example, is a pretty bad way of doing things. It assumes a very fixed model of looking at the universe, which is just not true. Decorator works best when you have just a single I/O channel. When you have multiple inputs &amp; outputs, decorating something becomes much harder.&#xA;In particular, implementing business logic like the one above in decorators make it very hard to figure out why things are happening. In particular, CachingDecorator is something that you want to avoid (better to use infrastructure or a auto caching proxy, instead).&#xA;Recommendation: It is a very useful pattern, and should be used when you actually have one input / output channel, because that is a great way to allow to dynamically compose the way we apply processing to it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently began to read the &#x201C;indies&#x201D; in the Amazon&#x2019;s listing, and I wanted to point out some things that I really enjoyed: The David Birkenhead series: &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; If I have one complaint about this series, it is that it the books are fairly short, typically less than 200 pages. That said, they are very well written, and the main protagonist is likable almost from the get go.&#xA0; I just noticed that the latest (Commander) came out, and I read it in one sitting.  It is good, really good, military Sci Fi. It is believable, interesting and in general, a lot of fun. The Admiral Who series: &#xA0; In contrast to the Birkenhead series, no one can complain that those books are short. Each comes at around 500 pages or so, and they are filled with a lot of really good content. This is a reluctant hero story, and it reminded me strongly of Mat from the Wheel of Time, just in space.   &#xA0; The problem with most indie content on Amazon is that they are frequently poorly edited. In both cases, however, the editing is pretty good (not perfect, but good enough that it doesn&#x2019;t distract from the story). And the stories more than compensate for that. Just to give you some idea bout how goo they are, I am currently re-reading those books, and that is a honor that many professionally produced books just don&#x2019;t get. The Birkenhead series is supposed to have another book in late October (my thought, it is already late October, any later and it is November!) and while there isn&#x2019;t a release date for the Admiral Who series, I am looking forward to both eagerly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The composite pattern describes that a group of objects are to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to &quot;compose&quot; objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.  More on this pattern. This post is supposed to come on the 1st of Nov or there about, which means that I&#x2019;m going to do a small divergence into politics now. Here is an example of how the upcoming presidential elections in the states.      1: public interface IVotingUnit   2: {   3:     int Weight { get;set; }   4:     int CandidateId { get;set; }   5: }   6:&#xA0;    7: public class Voter : IVotingUnit   8: {   9:     [Obsolete(&quot;Racist&quot;)]  10:     string Id { get;set; }  11:&#xA0;   12:     int Weight { get;set; }  13:&#xA0;   14:     int CandidateId { get;set; }  15: }  16:&#xA0;   17: public class WinnerTakesAllState : IVotingUnit  18: {  19:     string StateCode { get;set; }      20:&#xA0;   21:     int Weight { get;set; }  22:     int CandidateId { get;set; }  23:&#xA0;   24:     public void AddVote(Voter vote){  25:         // calculate  26:     }  27: }&#xA;Yes, this is probably a bad example of this, but I find it hilarious.&#xA0; The basic idea is that you can have an object that represent many other objects, but show the same external interface.&#xA;Composites are usually used for the more CS style of programming. Composites are very common in tree structures such as compiler AST or DOM. But beyond that, I can&#x2019;t easily recall any real world usage of them in my applications. There are usually better alternatives, and you have to remember that when you speak about enterprise applications, loading / storing the data is just as important. And trying to implement the composite pattern under those circumstances will lead to a world of hurt.&#xA;Recommendation: If your entire dataset can easily fit in memory, and it make sense, go ahead. Most of the time, you probably should stay away.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering which is meant to &quot;decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently&quot;.The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.  More about this pattern. Bridge is quite complex, mostly because it is composed of Abstraction, Refined Abstraction, Implementor and Concrete Implementor. Here is a concrete example (pun intended):   Abstraction: CImage Refined Abstraction: CBmpImage, CJpegImage Implementor: CimageImp Concrete Implementor: CWinImp, COS2Imp In general, I don&#x2019;t like complex things, and of the top of my head, I can&#x2019;t think of a time when I used this approach. Until such time when I can see a really good reason why I would want to do something like this, I see very little reason to bother. Recommendation: Avoid, there are simpler options to solving those sort of problems.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In computer programming, the adapter pattern (often referred to as the wrapper pattern or simply a wrapper) is a design pattern that translates one interface for a class into a compatible interface.  More about this pattern. This pattern is the first of the first of the Structural Patterns in the G04 book, and for the most part, it is meant to be used solely when you are integrating two or more external systems / libraries. When I saw it used inside a system, it almost always a Bad Thing, mostly because inside a single system, you want to use one of the other structural patterns. HttpContextWrapper is a good example of using this pattern, and it links back nicely to the previous discussion on Singletons. HttpContext.Current was an issue, because it didn&#x2019;t allow easy overriding / mocking / testing. The new HttpContextBase class was introduced, but due to backward compatibility concerns, HttpContext&#x2019;s base class could not be changed. The solution, introduce HttpContextWrapper implementation that adapts between the two. Useful pattern, but all too often people try to use it to abstract things, and that is most certainly not what it is meant for. Recommendation: Use when you need to integrate with code that you can&#x2019;t change (3rd party, legacy, compatibility concerns) using a common interface, but avoid otherwise.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.  More about this pattern. I won&#x2019;t show code or diagrams here. If you don&#x2019;t know the Singleton pattern, you probably don&#x2019;t have any business reading this series. Go hit the books and then come back for the rest of my review. Of the top of my head, I can&#x2019;t think of a single pattern that has been as denigrated as the Singleton pattern. It has been the bane of testers anywhere, and just about any Singleton implementation had had to become thread safe, given the demands that we usually have from our apps. That basically means that any time that you use a Singleton, you have to be damn sure that your code is thread safe.&#xA0; When it isn&#x2019;t, this becomes really painful. That along would be a huge mark against it, since multi thread proofing code is hard. But Singleton also got a bad rep because they create hidden dependencies that were hard to break. Probably the most famous of them was HttpContext.Current and DateTime.Now. Singleton may have a tattered reputation and wounded dignity, but it is still a crucially important pattern. Most of the issues that people have with the Singleton aren&#x2019;t with the notion of the single instance, but with the notion of a global static gateway, which means that it becomes very hard to modify for things like tests, and it is easy to create code that is very brittle in its dependencies on its environment. Common workaround to that is to break apart the notion of accessing the value and the single nature of the value. So you typically inject the value in, and something else, usually the container, is in charge of managing the lifetime of the object. Common use cases for Singletons include caches (which would be pretty bad if they didn&#x2019;t stuck around) and the NHibernate&#x2019;s Session Factory (which is very expensive to create). Recommendation: The notion of having just a single instance of an object is still very important, especially when you use that single instance to coordinate things. It does means that you have multi threading issues, but that can be solved. It is a very useful pattern, but you have to watch for the pit falls (global static accessor that is used all over the place is one of the major ones).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A customer had a problem. They were mostly using the RavenDB HiLo algorithm for saving documents to the database, which is very fast &amp; cheap. That client, however, chose to use the identity method. Which means that RavenDB will assign the value.  This is usually used if you need to have sequential values. The identity is actually being managed internally by RavenDB, and that works perfectly fine.  Except&#x2026; What happens when you enter replication to the mix. The documents with the identity values are replicated to the secondary server, and there we don&#x2019;t have the identity value, we just have the docs being written with their full id. (users/1, users/2, users/3, etc). So far, so good. But what happens when you have a failover and you need to write to the secondary, and you use the identity? Well, RavenDB ain&#x2019;t stupid, and it won&#x2019;t overwrite the users/1 document. Instead, it will search for the next available opening from the smallest identity value generated and use that. The code looks like this:      1: private long GetNextIdentityValueWithoutOverwritingOnExistingDocuments(string key,    2:     IStorageActionsAccessor actions,    3:     TransactionInformation transactionInformation)   4: {   5:     long nextIdentityValue;   6:     do   7:     {   8:         nextIdentityValue = actions.General.GetNextIdentityValue(key);   9:     } while (actions.Documents.DocumentMetadataByKey(key &#x2B; nextIdentityValue, transactionInformation) != null);  10:     return nextIdentityValue;  11: }&#xA;This works, great. Except when you have large number of documents that have already been written. Instead of the brute force search, we now use the following approach:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: public long GetNextIdentityValueWithoutOverwritingOnExistingDocuments(string key,   2:     IStorageActionsAccessor actions,   3:     TransactionInformation transactionInformation,   4:     out int tries)   5: {   6:     long nextIdentityValue = actions.General.GetNextIdentityValue(key);   7:&#xA0;    8:     if (actions.Documents.DocumentMetadataByKey(key &#x2B; nextIdentityValue, transactionInformation) == null)   9:     {  10:         tries = 1;  11:         return nextIdentityValue;  12:     }  13:     tries = 1;  14:     // there is already a document with this id, this means that we probably need to search  15:     // for an opening in potentially large data set.   16:     var lastKnownBusy = nextIdentityValue;  17:     var maybeFree = nextIdentityValue*2;  18:     var lastKnownFree = long.MaxValue;  19:     while (true)  20:     {  21:         tries&#x2B;&#x2B;;  22:         if(actions.Documents.DocumentMetadataByKey(key &#x2B; maybeFree, transactionInformation) == null)  23:         {  24:             if (lastKnownBusy &#x2B; 1 == maybeFree)  25:             {  26:                 actions.General.SetIdentityValue(key, maybeFree);  27:                 return maybeFree;  28:             }  29:             lastKnownFree = maybeFree;  30:             maybeFree = Math.Max(maybeFree - (maybeFree - lastKnownBusy) / 2, lastKnownBusy &#x2B; 1);  31:&#xA0;   32:         }  33:         else  34:         {  35:             lastKnownBusy = maybeFree;  36:             maybeFree = Math.Min(lastKnownFree, maybeFree*2);  37:         }  38:     }  39: }&#xA;This can figure out the first free item in a range of billion documents in under 100 tries, which I am pretty sure if good enough.</p>
