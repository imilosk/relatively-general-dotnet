            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been writing about the internals of RavenDB for quite a while, and it is fascinating in many respects, but it gets tiring to keep thinking about bits &amp; bytes all the time. I&#x2019;m missing writing some of the more high level stuff, in particular about software architecture. So I thought that I would take the time to resurrect a very old post series of mine, Macto. I actually have quite a few posts about this, but they are all close to a decade old, so I might as well start from scratch.&#xA;Macto is a sample app for managing a prison. This is one of the few areas in which I can be an expert on the business requirements that isn&#x2019;t utterly boring (I don&#x2019;t want to do yet another E-Commerce stuff).&#xA0; To keep up with the times, Macto is going to be written with a Micro service architecture, and just for fun, I might be doing that in multiple languages and platforms, because prison is not fun, and neither should be working on it&#x2019;s computing systems . Oh, and there is also the real world thing, I guess.&#xA;Since 2009, I have pretty much given up on building anything UI wise, so I&#x2019;m going to show a few mockup screens, but the idea is that I&#x2019;m going to be looking only at backend code, with another team actually doing the user interface.&#xA;The first thing to start with, I guess, is to paint the overall architecture of the system. Prisons are pretty rigid systems, as you might expect, but there are a lot of interconnected parts. In order to properly build a system to manage a prison we need to be able to answer what is going on from multiple points of view and from very different perspectives.&#xA;The prison commander cares about such things as the inmate&#x2019;s count (the job is to keep them all hale and accounted for). The individual guard care about the particular set of cells they are assigned to and the inmates in them. The guys at Registrations care about the legal details of having a lawful warrant for holding an inmate in prison as well as when an inmate should be released. Intelligence cares about the connections between inmates, the kind of heads up that came through channels and what kind of actions should be taken as a result. Medical needs to verify that incoming inmates are fit to be held in the facility and Transfers needs to ensure that any movements of inmates outside the prison will complete successfully (as in, you got them out, you also gotta bring them all in).&#xA;Each of those pieces interact with others in interesting and complex ways. For example, incoming inmates needs to go through Registration for legal paperwork, Medical for certification, Intelligence for verification and then assigned to the proper block.&#xA0; Once they are accepted into the prison, they are the charge of the particular block they are assigned to and rarely need to interact with the rest of the prison unless something extraordinary happens (visits, court, sickness, etc).&#xA;When thinking about the software architecture of such a system, the most important rule to remember is that we want the system to be used, this means that we really need to plan for what people are actually doing (in abstract of what they should be doing) and to help them do things, rather than hinder them. In most places, all these details are done with pen &amp; paper, and it works, so our system will have to offer something more. Not to the prison administration, but to the actual people going about their work with the inmates.&#xA;From a software architecture point of view, we are going to model the system as a set of independent services that will each have the role of one of the departments inside the prison. The current term in micro-services, but in real systems, they are not so micro, so we might need to repeatedly break things apart until we get to a level in which things make sense in isolation.&#xA;A lot of the complexity is involved in managing such a system is in the flow of information across the system. In a prison, this is the responsibility of the Command &amp; Control Center (C3, from now on) which is in charge of coordination and monitoring of actions across the board. This also work very closely with the heads of all departments and the prison commander as well as most other external parties, but it generally does nothing on its own.&#xA;I think that this is enough of an intro, and we&#x2019;ll get right on to things in the next post, where we&#x2019;ll talk about Counting Inmates.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As part of our 4.0 deployment, we have a cluster made of mixed machines, some running Windows, some running Linux. In one particular configuration, we have 2 Windows services and a single Linux machine. We setup the cluster and started directing production traffic to it, and all was good. We left for the weekend and came back the following week, to see what the results were.&#xA0; Our Linux machine was effectively down. It was not responding to queries and it seemed like it was non responsive. That was good and bad. It was good because the rest of the cluster just worked, and there was no interruption in service. This is as designed, but it is always nice to see this in real life. It is bad because it isn&#x2019;t supposed to be happening. What was really frustrating was that we were able to log into the machine and there was nothing wrong there.No high CPU or memory, no outstanding I/O or anything of the kind that we are used to. The first clue for us was trying to diagnose the problem from inside the machine, where we able to reproduce it by trying to access the server from the local machine, resulting in the exact same issue as observed externally. Namely, the server would accept the connection and just leave it hanging, eventually timing out.That was a interesting discovery, since it meant that we can rule out anything in the middle. This is a problem in this machine. But the problem remained quite hard to figure out. We deployed to production in a manner similar to what we expect our users will do, so we used Let&#x2019;s Encrypt as the certificate authority with auto generated certificates.So we started by seeing where the problem is, whatever this is on the TCP side or the SSL side, we issued the following command:openssl s_client -connect b.cluster-name.dbs.local.ravendb.net:443This command showed immediate connection to the server and the client sending the ClientHello properly, but then just hanging there. What was really interesting is that if we waited about 2 minutes, that SSL connection would complete successfully. But we couldn&#x2019;t figure out any reason why this would be the case. It occurred to me that it might be related to the system handling of reverse DNS lookup. The two minutes timeout was very suspicious, and I assumed that it might be trying to lookup the client certificate and somehow resolve that. That isn&#x2019;t how it works in general, although the fact that some SSH (and not SSL/TLS) configuration directly relate to this has led us in a merry chase.Eventually we pulled strace and looked into what is actually going on. We focused on the following calls:sudo strace -fp 1017 -s 128 -Tfe open,socket,connect,sendto,recvfrom,writeThe interesting bits from there are shown here:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Then we have a connect() to 172.31.0.2 which is an AWS name server. Note that this is done over UDP, as you can see from the SOCK_DGRAM option in the preceding socket() call. We are getting some data back, and we can see identrust there. And then we see something really suspicious. We have a TCP socket call that goes to 192.35.177.64 on port 80. In other words, this is an HTTP call. What does an HTTP call is doing in the middle of an SSL handshake? As it turned out, our firewall configuration was blocking outbound connections to port 80. We tested removing that rule and everything came back online and the server was running just fine. Further inspection revealed that we were calling to: http://apps.identrust.com/roots/dstrootcax3.p7cAnd this is where things started to jell together. We are using Let&#x2019;s Encrypt certificates, and in order to ensure trust, we need to send the full chain to the user. SSL Certificates has the notion of Authority Information Access, which is basically a URL that is registered in the certificate that points to where you can find the certificate that signed this one. Why is this using HTTP? Because the data that will be fetched is already signed, and it is not a secret. And trying to use HTTPS to fetch it might get us into a loop. So whenever we had a new SSL connection, we&#x2019;ll try to connect to IdenTrust to get the full chain to send to the client. The killer here is that if we fail to do so, we&#x2019;ll send the certificate chain we have (without the missing root), but it will work, since the other side already have this root installed (usually). On Windows, this certificate is installed, so we didn&#x2019;t see it. On Linux, we didn&#x2019;t have that certificate installed, so we had to look it up every single time.The gory details, including dives into the source code are in the GitHub issue. And I do think they are gory. In this case, once we realized what was going on we were able to take steps to handle this. We needed to pre-register the entire chain on the local machine, so any lookup will be able to find it locally, and not do a network call per each SSL connection. But beyond mutating the global certificate store, there is no real way to prevent that remote call.Note that this is also true for Windows, although that seems to be implemented much deeper in the stack, and not in managed code, so I wasn&#x2019;t able to trace where this is actually happening. The really bad thing here is that from the outside, there is no way for us to control or disable this, so this is just something that you have to remember to do when you use certificates, make sure that the entire chain is registered on each machine, otherwise you might have a remote call per connection, or a very long (and synchronous!) hang until the request times out if you are blocking outgoing access.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We got a serious situation on one of our test cases. We put the system through a lot, pushing it to the breaking point and beyond. And it worked, in fact, it worked beautifully. Up until the point that we started to use too many resources and crashed. While normally that would be expected, it really bugged us, we had provisions in place to protect us against that. Bulkheads were supposed to be blocked, operations rolled back, etc. We were supposed to react properly, reduce costs of operations, prefer being up to being fast, the works.&#xA;That did not happen. From the outside, what happened is that we go to the point where we would trigger the &#x201C;sky about the fall, let&#x2019;s conserve everything we can&#x201D;, but we didn&#x2019;t see the reaction that we expected from the system. Oh, we were started to use a lot less resources, but the resources that we weren&#x2019;t using? They weren&#x2019;t going back to the OS, they were still held.&#xA;It&#x2019;s easiest to talk about memory in this regard. We hold buffers in place to handle requests, and in order to avoid fragmentation, we typically make them large buffers, that are resident on the large object heap.&#xA;When RavenDB detects that there is a low memory situation, it starts to scale back. It releases any held buffers, completes ongoing works and starts working on much smaller batches, etc. We saw that behavior, and we certainly saw the slow down as RavenDB was willing to take less upon itself. But what we didn&#x2019;t see is the actual release of resources as a result of this behavior.&#xA;And as it turned out, that was because we were too good about managing ourselves. A large part of the design of RavenDB 4.0 was around reducing the cost of garbage collections by reducing allocations as much as possible. This means that we are running very few GCs. In fact, GC Gen 2 collections are rare on our environment. However, we need these Gen 2 collections to be able to clean up stuff that is in the finalizer queue. In fact, we typically need two such runs before the GC can be certain that the memory is not in use and actually collect it.&#xA;In this particular situation, we were careful to code so we will get very few GC collections running, and that led us to crash because we would run out of resources&#xA0; before the GC could realize that we are actually not really using them at this point.&#xA;The solution, by the way, was to change the way we respond to low memory conditions. We&#x2019;ll be less good about keeping all the memory around and if it isn&#x2019;t being used, we&#x2019;ll start discarding it a lot sooner, so the GC has better chance to actually realize that is isn&#x2019;t being used and recover the memory. An instead of throwing the buffers away all at once when we have low memory and hope that the GC will be fast enough in collecting them, we&#x2019;ll keep them around and reuse them, avoiding the additional allocations that processing more requests would have required.&#xA;Since the GC isn&#x2019;t likely to be able to actually free them in time, we aren&#x2019;t affecting the total memory consumed in this scenario but are able to reduce allocations by serving the buffers that are already allocated. This two actions, being less rigorous about policing our memory and not freeing things when we get low memory are confusingly enough to get both reduce the chance of getting into low memory and reduce the chance of actually using too much memory in such a case.</p>
