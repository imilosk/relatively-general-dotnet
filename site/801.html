            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was asked about using NHibernate in a Domain Driven scenario, with the Entities, Aggregates&#xA0;and Repositories. Specifically, with regard to doing validation. A domain driven problem needs a domain, so I&#x27;ll chose the Northwind one. We have an Order aggregate, which has OrderLines, Shipments (which has OrderLines as well) and billing.     I am not so hot about validation (beyond rudimetry input validation), because I believe that Invalid State make the application flexible. Here is a simple business rule:The user may not order more than their credit limit allows.    Which can be translated in the code to:            public&#xA0;void&#xA0;AddLine(OrderLine&#xA0;lineItem)        {        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;if(&#xA0;this.TotalCost&#xA0;&#x2B;&#xA0;lineItem.TotalCost&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;CreditService.GetLimit(this.Customer))        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;throw&#xA0;new&#xA0;ValidationException(&quot;Passed&#xA0;credit&#xA0;limit&quot;);        &#xA0;&#xA0;orderLines.Add(lineItem);        &#xA0;&#xA0;lineItem.Order&#xA0;=&#xA0;this;        }        This is all very well, until you realize that when the user is browsing the store, they are likely to place many more items on the order than they actually intend to buy. The code above basically forces the user to stop what they are doing and make a decision about what items they want the most. That is not a good idea, because the user flow is interrupted with completely arbitrary and needless error.    I am more in favor of validating specific rules when the state change require it. In this case, I would check this business logic when trying to move the order to processed state. Another thing is throwing an exception for validation error. This is counter productive, because you need to guard against those, and it makes it harder to deal with violations of more than a single business rule.    Using the Domain Driven approach, we would like to use the Agrregate as the place where to put validation and business rules for the entities contained in the aggregate.     Often, a case is made for validating the state when the entities are being persisted, this can be an issue if/when you have partially loaded object graphs that you need to handle, while stil keeping the logic in its rightful place. I can think of several solutions to this, which mostly involves NHibernate intecetors and some attributes. I am not going to show them, because I don&#x27;t believe that this is the right approach.    Validation may be a cross cutting concern, but I don&#x27;t like the idea of it being trasperant. There is also the issue of &quot;what do you do if it is invalid?&quot; From an interceptor, the only thing that you can do is to throw, which put the session (and the related object graph) into an invalid state, not something that you should be eager to do.    I thought about utilizing the respective repositories for this, but I don&#x27;t see the point here. Repositories are for the getting data, I am usually not explicitly saving stuff unless I have just created it (Unit Of Work is cool!), so there isn&#x27;t any point in putting it in something like the Save() method there.    Thinking about this, I come back to Udi&#x27;s discussion about task oriented interface, this is a far better approach in my opinion, since it means that we no longer talk in abstract terms, but rather in clear, meaningful domain concepts. So instead of having a validator that would check the state of an order, and run the appropriate validation, I would have a method on the Order class that would tell it to change its state, and it would validate itself. This goes for deep object graphs as well, in my opinion. There aren&#x27;t many actions on the aggregate boundary that it isn&#x27;t the one to initiate.     In short, don&#x27;t try to find a technical solution to this problem, this is possible, but I feel that it would result in a clearer design and implementation to make this far more explicit.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jon Galloway&#xA0;presents an interesting point of view&#xA0;about why Microsoft can&#x27;t ship open source code. Basically, it boils down to the fear that an Open Source project that is licensed under a permissive license will &quot;aquire&quot; a piece of code that originated from GPL code, thus infecting the rest of the code distributing with that project with the GPL license. The implications of which would cause either (A) windows itself to be GPLed, (B) tremendous costs for recalling and replacing the GPLed sections.    The example given is distibuting Paint.NET, where a GPL code found in it can be will cause a recall of Windows.    This sounds reasonable enough, on the surface, but I don&#x27;t agree with this on a number of counts. I would like to point out that most OSS developers have at least basic understanding about what licenses, but that is actually beside the point.    It is far more important to consider the fact that the GPL applies to derived work only. Even assuming that the Paint.NET source code is found to contain GPLed bug, it has no implications on anything else in Windows. The worst case scenario would be that Paint.NET itself would be forced to become GPL, no other affect on anything else on Windows.     In fact, the GPL License explicitly allows this:&#xA0;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.    Jon goes on to point out that the implications of this:Microsoft can release projects with source code on sites like SourceForge and CodePlex when the potential damage is low. The kinds of projects you&#x27;ll see released as open source are generally good tools which will benefit developers, but wouldn&#x27;t cause a major crisis if they had to be pulled. They can&#x27;t, however, accept community contributions since they can&#x27;t verify that the code is free of copyright / left restrictions.    Again, I disagree. Some projects are fairly chaotic in this manner (usually GPLed ones), and will accept any patch, and may incur this issue. (This is non issue for GPLed projects, although there is also the reverse issue here, but that is rarer) Most open source projects require that you would either explicitly transfer ownership of the code or that you would guarantee that you are adding your own code, and not some random code that you grabbed from somewhere.    This also completely ignore the fact that a valid response for GPL code found in your code is to remove the offending code and get on with your life. A possible response would be to release an update via Windows Update in such scenario.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have just tracked down the Nthbug in my application that I can blame ASP.Net Ajax for. To be rather exact, I can blame ASP.Net Ajax performance, and to be absolutely clear, I am talking about initialization performance.     The main issue is that I keep running into is that it takes human noticable time for the extended behaviors to be set on the page. By human noticable time I means over a second. The immediate result is that users are able to interact with the page in unexpected ways. Leading to all sorts of reported bugs that are plain impossible to reproduce unless you are aware of it.    Case in point, I have a link that point to a page, and on that link, I have defined the ModalPopupExtender. In the popup, the user is expected to fill some values, after which it will post to the next page. Imagine my surprise when I get a bug report saying that the next page showing an error about missing details. I tested it, the QA tested it, everything seemed to work, but the bug kept popping up every now and then.    It took a while to understand that the key difference was how soon the link was pressed after the page was loaded. The QA saying &quot;and now I am going to press this link&quot; was usually just enough for ASP.Net Ajax to initialize itself correctly.    The reasoning for this is that JavaScript is inheritly slow, and ASP.Net Ajax groups all the initialization code at the bottom of the page, so it is the last thing that is being run.&#xA0; This is on a dual core, 3.4Ghz and 4Gb development machine! I am sick and tired of handling race conditions as it is, the last thing that I need is trying to handle them in javascript!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Daddy Starr&#xA0;has reponded to the latest discussion on TFS vs a mixture of tools, he points out that something that was missing from the discussion is...            This misses the entire point of a common development platform, which is a far more important value proposition than a feature set within a subsystem.&#xA0; The ability to repeatedly drive software through to delivery using common standards of quality, completeness, performance, trace-ability, and transparency is invaluable to any organization.                Do you really think you can get all of that from cobbling together loosely coupled open source components?&#xA0; Having been there and done that, I say, &#x201C;No way.&#x201D;        I agree with the first point, but disagree with the second. I can get this from a a set of components that I assemble together. It is not trivial, but it is not very hard either, and it is something that you need to do anyway.Open source vs. Microsoft is a pointless debate not worthy of my time to explore.     Agreed, the discussion was being side tracked because I use OSS tools and gave examples from them, but I was mostly talking about the general idea of separate tools that collaborate for a cohesive whole.            The one thing about Team System that is met with the most doubt is the idea that the system is genuinely open. [...] For example, we already know that we can use CruiseControl.Net to run the builds instead of TFS build types.&#xA0; We can use NUnit as the unit test framework instead of MSUnit.        And didn&#x27;t you just lose the integrated benefits? Yes, I am aware that you can use CC.Net to work against TFS, and you can use NUnit to run tests, etc. But those aren&#x27;t integrated into the product, you need to &quot;cobble together&quot; a solution that would give their output back into the system. How do you track build results now? How do you go from a build to the change set that triggered it?    The part that I seem to fail to explain is that I have looked at TFS, saw that it had major failings in Unit Testing, Continious Integration and Source Control, once I saw that, I was no longer interested in the integrated package. And if I am not interested in the integrated package, what does TFS has to offer me? Not much that I can&#x27;t get from somewhere else, frankly.Aren&#x2019;t we tired of arguing about source control systems and defect tracking?&#xA0;    Remind me not to mention the Vi vs. Emacs discussion, then :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Dave Laribee had a great post&#xA0;where he details some of the qualities of an open minded developer. He also coined the term ALT.NET.    A few others has taken this idea and extedned&#xA0;and bulleted it. I really don&#x27;t like it. I have two main issues with making this idea into a series of boolean bullet points.    Saying things like &quot;An ALT.NET developer would be using Castle Windsor before Enterprise Libraries ObjectBuilder.&quot;, or &quot;An ALT.NET developer was using NHibernate before the Entity Framework.&quot; is giving the wrong impression. It gives the impression of you are either with us (good) and against us (bad). And you must follow Our (notice the royality speak) way and no other.    The other objection is that it is focusing on tools and not on a mind set. The way I see it, this is much more about keeping your head open to new approach and ideas, regardless of where they come from.&#xA0;In short, I really like the ideas and concepts that Dave presents, I don&#x27;t want the idea to turn into &quot;A .NET developers that seeks to use non Microsoft technologies.&quot; I would much rather it be &quot;A developer that seeks to find the best tools and practices, and judge them on merit.&quot;    We as an industry has enough problems with the &quot;We Are A Microsoft Shop, Do Not Write Non Microsoft Certified Code!&quot; apprach, we don&#x27;t need it in the other direction. Prejudice can go both ways, after all, and reverse racism is just as unacceptable.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When comparing NHibernate to the Entity Framework, I found two places that the Entity Framework could do things that were difficult to do with NHibernate.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just got a bug report for Rhino Mocks from Kevin Miller. Those are not that common, but not very rare. That one came with a test case, which is also fairly common for bug reports (after all, Rhino Mocks is used in TDD scenarios :-) ).     I gave it a glance, saw that it had a lot of stuff that I needed to read, and started to put it on my ToDo list. Then I looked at the attached file name.&#xA0;For no particular reason, I have this convention of putting all the bug reports for Rhino Mocks using &quot;FieldProblem_[ReporterFirstName]&quot;.&#xA0;The file that kevin sent me was named &quot;FieldProblem_Kevin.cs&quot;     That was interesting enough that I fired opened the file right away, saw that this file could simply be dragged into the Rhino Mocks solution, with no extra modifications needed (namespaces, naming, etc). That was enough for me to follow up immediately. Luckily, this was something that I was able to quickly fix.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Check this out. Even though that Jim says that it is on the IronPython site, I can&#x27;t find it, but I am still loving it. Making the CLR more friendly to dynamic languages is a Good Thing in general, but the thing that excites me is the possiblity that it can be leveraged from my code as well.    I paid my IL taxes, and while Linq expressions are nice, I would like to get solid support for runtime code generation without having to do it in the assembly level.</p>
