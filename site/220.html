            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note: These series of posts are about a planned feature, exploring how we go about building it. This is meant to solicit feedback and get more eyes on the idea, things aren&#x2019;t set in stone and we don&#x2019;t have a firm release date on this.We have been wanting to add graph queries to RavenDB for several years now, but we always had more important things get in the way. That didn&#x2019;t prevent us from discussing this internally and sketch up a few options. We are now looking at this more seriously and I thought that sharing the details of our deliberations would be interesting and likely to garner us some valuable feedback. I&#x2019;m going to assume that the reader is at least somewhat familiar with the notion of graph data and graph queries. Probably the most well known graph database is Neo4J, which provides the notion of nodes and edges, both of which have a type and a set of (flat) properties. This allow you to define a model of any arbitrary complexity. This works if you model is purely graph based, but it doesn&#x2019;t work for RavenDB, whose users are used to the document model. On the surface, this looks like a minor detail. RavenDB has documents, which can have any shape, including containing embedded values and collections inside them. Neo4J, on the other hand, model things differently. The simplest example that I can think of is Orders and Order Lines, where you&#x2019;ll have the following models:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Neo4J&#xA;RavenDB&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Both models have the same information, but each element in the Neo4J graph is an independent node that is linked to the others. On the other hand, with RavenDB, we have a single document that embeds a lot of the information directly.&#xA0; Note that what we haven&#x2019;t shown in the image is that in RavenDB as well, you have other documents as well. The products, for example, are separate documents.&#xA0; Graph databases are often used to handle the basis of recommendation engines, fraud detection, etc. But they are usually used to augment the capabilities of the system, rather than as the primary data store of applications. RavenDB, on the other hand, is most frequently deployed as the primary data store. We want to give our users the ability to perform graph operations, but we don&#x2019;t want to lose anything that make RavenDB useful and easy to use. We initially thought about having the following definition:Each document is (implicitly) a node in the graph.You can call Link(src,dest,type, attributes) to create an edge between any two documents. Provide the usual graph queries on top of that.We started exploring this implementation, but it quickly led to mounting complexity. From the point of view of the user, it led to having to do additional work, you&#x2019;ll have to maintain your document model and the edges at the same time. This allow you to do some interesting things, but it also likely to cause complications down the line and very likely to cause issues when the document model and graph model disagree with one another. Other issues relates to how do you handle graphs in a distributed manner. How do you deal with the creation on an edge between two documents on one node when one of them was deleted on another? We pushed in that direction for a while, because that was the obvious thing to do, but it really turned up to be a bad idea which didn&#x2019;t play well with the rest of RavenDB. The worst part was the fact that you might modify the document properties but not define the edge, which lead to inconsistency. This was very easy to do.The next thing we played with was to remove the Link() call and allow the user to define a background operation that would go and create the links between documents automatically whenever they were updated. This would allow us to avoid having any inconsistencies between the data in the documents and the links between then. After thinking about this for a while, we went ahead with this approach, but removed the requirement for a background operations.RavenDB will be able to use your existing document model as the graph model as well. In other words, in the model above, you have the orders/2 document, which has two links, for each of the products. This give us both the ability to have a well define document model, with its well known Domain Driven architecture and the ability to hop off all the pre-existing links that we have in the model. I&#x2019;ll discuss the querying model and how it all plays together in a future post. For now, I want to show you how this looks like when we want to do a typical graph operation, friends of friends:More details will come in the next post&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into this twit:&#xA;&#xA;This resonated very strongly with me, because when we architected RavenDB 4.0, one of the key considerations was the issue of debuggability. RavenDB instances often run for months on end, usually only restarted to apply updates to OS or database. They are often running in production environments where it is not possible to do any meaningful debugging. We rely heavily on resolving issues through minidumps, core dumps, etc. Part of the work we did in architecting RavenDB 4.0 was to sit down and think about supporting the system in production. For many of the core components, async was right out. Part of that was because of issues relating to the unpredictability of async execution, we want certain things to always happen first, avoid thread pool starvation / growth policies / etc. But primarily, we were sick and tired of getting a dump (or even just pausing a running instance when we debug a complex situation) and having to manually reconstruct the state of the system. Parallel stacks alone is an amazing feature for figuring out what is going on in a complex system.The design of RavenDB called for any long lived task to run on a dedicated thread. These threads are named, so if you stop in the debugger, you can very quickly see what is actually is going on there. This is also useful for things like account for memory, CPU time, etc. We had a problem in a particular component that was leaking memory at a rate of 144 bytes per second, just under 12 MB per day. This is something that is very easy to lose in the noise. But because we do memory accounting on a thread basis, it was easy to go to a system that was running for a few weeks and see that this particular thing had 500MB of memory in use, when we expected maybe 15MB. We still use async for handling of short term operations. For example, processing of a single request, because these are fast and if there are problems with them, we&#x2019;ll usually see them already executing. I&#x2019;m really happy with this decision, since it provided us many dividends down the line. We planned this for production, to be honest, but it ended up really helpful in normal debugging as well. This also allow us to take advantage of the fact that a thread that is not runnable is effectively free (aside from some memory, of course), so we can dedicate a full thread for these long running tasks and greatly simplify everything. An index in RavenDB always has its own dedicated thread, which is woken up if there is anything that this index needs to process. This means that indexing code is simple, isolated and we can start applying policies at the index level easily. For example, if I have an index that has a low priority, I can just adjust the thread&#x2019;s priority and let the OS do the hard work of scheduling it accordingly.Async simplifies the programming model significantly, but it also come at a cost of system complexity and maintenance overhead. Figuring out that you have a request stuck on a task that will never return, for example, is never pleasant. The same thing using blocking operations is immediately obvious. That is a benefit that should absolutely not be discounted.</p>

If they hesitate too much in answering this, we typically just run this snippet in the browser and ask them to explain the results. This is important because it shows that they understand the execution model, how code is interleaves, etc.The next stage is to ask them what the following snippet will do:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

We let them think about this for a few seconds and then run it in the browser. Asking them to explain why it gave the output it gave is a lot more interesting.The final piece of this line of questions is to have them implement the following:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

This isn&#x2019;t a trivial thing to implement, because you need to understand lambdas, how to coordinate several actions into a cohesive whole, etc. We usually ask people to describe us how they would handle something like this, not actually write the code. And hearing the thought process that the candidates go through as they solve this can be illuminating.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I use Open Live Writer to post to this blog, the problem is that whenever I post a new post, it opens up the metadata api endpoint in the browser (services/metaweblogapi.ashx). I actually want to see the blog post that I just posted. I decided that this was annoying enough that I&#x2019;m going to figure out how this is done and see if there is a way for my blog to give Open Live Writer the address of the newly created post.I want this to be a focused operation, I don&#x2019;t wanna read through it all. So I&#x2019;m going to see if I can figure out how this works with a minimum of effort. I know that OLW is opening the browser after the post is published, this is usually done with Process.Start, so I run the following query:The very first result is promising, showing ExecuteFile. This sounds interesting, let&#x2019;s see how this is used. No one seems to be calling this method, but reading through the ShellHelper file, I run into LaunchUrl(), which seems promising. Searching for this method got me to some interesting locations, including the ViewPage method, which seems to be exact what I want.&#xA0;This seems to indicate that the blog post should support pages, not sure what this is about, but I found this piece of code by searching for IsPage:Not sure what pages are, but looking at the configuration for my blog, I see:Continuing my blaze through the code, I can see we have:My blog doesn&#x2019;t implement this method, but OLW doesn&#x2019;t probe for this. It seems that because I&#x2019;m using the generic interface, it already pre-loaded the available options there. What this means is that this exploration ended up at a dead end. I figured out roughly what is going on, but actually getting all the details is probably too much of a hassle for me to debug through the OLW code and update my blog engine. I&#x2019;m already used to just closing the newly opened tab and go to the new post directly. I&#x2019;ll keep this in my todo tasks for when I actually get around to doing this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last Friday, RavenDB 4.1 hit the RTM milestone and then went out to see what other interesting things it can do. The highlights include:Cluster wide transactionsJavaScript indexesSQL Migration WizardDistributed CountersRavenDB EmbeddedMongoDB &amp; CosmosDB migrationThe Inside RavenDB book is also complete and is now available at Amazon. This ended up being 562 pages of deep dive into everything that RavenDB does, how it does it and most importantly, why it is doing so. Not willing to just give you the raw details, I tried to tell both the story of RavenDB and place it in context, so you&#x2019;ll understand how to actually make the best use of the database. This has been almost a year and a half in the making. I&#x2019;m really glad that I wrote the book, because the mere fact that I had to present a coherent story for the book was very helpful for the product itself. Of course, that meant that I had to go and re-write a bunch of stuff, but the end result is both a better product and a better book.The book is available in both paper back formats and on Kindle (and Kindle Unlimited). I would really appreciate any feedback you have. The actual first copy are currently in the mail (currently residing in Weybridge, Surrey GB) and I can&#x2019;t wait to actually hold them in my hands.In other news, we are nearing public availability of 4.1 in RavenHQ as well. RavenHQ is currently in the middle of their private beta for RavenDB 4. Along with supporting v4.1, RavenHQ is revamping it&#x27;s hosting model to offer features such as hosting multiple databases per subscription and the ability to create a cluster in the region of your choice. RavenHQ will be opening up it&#x27;s V4.1 clusters to the public within the next few weeks, but the private beta is currently offering clusters for free! If you&#x2019;d like to participate in the private beta, fill out their survey to get an invitation.The hosting model revamp sounds small, but it has huge implications on all sort of details that you have to get right when you operate at the scale that RavenHQ does. In particular, whereas the 3.5 offering for RavenHQ is for a single (replicated) database, the RavenDB 4.1 offering is actually a full fledged cluster. This give you the ability to manage your own databases, designate production / test / dev environments, automatically create databases, etc. RavenHQ is still going to operate and manage everything for you, but you will now have far more freedom.</p>
