            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Starting with build 2603, we are now considering 2.5 to be a release candidate. It is feature frozen, and only bug fixes are going in. You can download the new version here: http://hibernatingrhinos.com/builds/ravendb-unstable-v2.5, and it is also available on nuget as an unstable release. There have been a lot of changes, most of which were recorded on this blog. Next week I&#x2019;ll do a proper post about what is new, but in the meantime, you can check the release notes. I urge you to download it and take it for a spin. We really need feedback from users about how it works, and any problems that you might run into.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It appears that in my previous post I have had an issue with how I read the code. In particular, I looked at the commit log and didn&#x2019;t look at the most recent changes with regards to how HyperLevelDB does the writes. Robert Escriva has been kind enough to point me in the right direction.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The way that this works is a lot more elegant, I think.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;When you want to make a write to a file, you ask for a segment at a particular offset. If we have that offset already mapped, we give it to the caller. Otherwise, we increase the file size if needed, then map the next segment. That part is done under a lock, so there isn&#x2019;t an issue of contention over the end of the file. That is much nicer than the pwrite method.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That said, however, I am still not sure about the issue with the two concurrent transactions. What actually happens here is that while we gained concurrency in the IO, there is still some serialization going on. In other words, even though transaction B was actually flushed to disk before transaction A, it would still wait for transaction A to complete, alleviating the concern that I have had about it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As mentioned earlier, HyperDex has made some changes to LevelDB to make it work faster for their scenarios. I was curious to see what changed, so I took a look at the code. In my previous post, I dealt with compaction, but now I want to deal exclusively with the changes that were made to leveldb to make writes more concurrent.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Update:&#xA0;it appears that I made a mistake in reading the code (I didn&#x27;t check the final version). See this post for the correction.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another change that was made that I am really not sure that I am following is the notion of concurrent log writer. This relies on the pwrite() method, which allows you to write a buffer to a file at a specified position. I have not been able to figure out what is going on if you have concurrent writes to that file. The HyperDex modifications include synchronization on the offset where they will actually&#xA0; make the write, but after that, they make concurrent calls. It make sense, I guess, but I have several problems with that. I was unable to find any details about the behavior of the system when making concurrent calls to pwrite() at the end of the file, especially since your position might be well beyond the current end of file.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what the behavior was supposed to be under those conditions, so I fired up a linux machine and wrote the following code:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   1: int main() {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   2:   char* str1 = &quot;1234\n&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   3:   char* str2 = &quot;5678\n&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   4:   int  file_descriptor;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   5:   int  ret;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   6:   char fn[]=&quot;test&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   7:&#xA0; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   8:   if ((file_descriptor = creat(fn, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR)) &lt; 0)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   9:   {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  10:     perror(&quot;creat() error&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  11:     return -1;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  12:   }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  13:   else {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  14:     ret = pwrite(file_descriptor, str2, 5, 5);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  15:     printf(&quot;Wrote %d\n&quot;, ret);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  16:     &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  17:     ret = pwrite(file_descriptor, str1, 5, 10);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  18:     printf(&quot;Wrote %d\n&quot;, ret);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  19:     &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  20:     if (close(file_descriptor)!= 0)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  21:        perror(&quot;close() error&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  22:     &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  23:   }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  24:   &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  25:   return 0;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  26: }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I&#x2019;ll be the first to admit that this is ugly code, but it gets the job done, and it told me that you could issues those sort of writes, and it would do the expected thing. I am going to assume that it would still work when used concurrently on the same file.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That said, there is still a problem, let us assume the following sequence of events:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write A&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write B&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write A is allocated range [5 &#x2013; 10] in the log file&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write B is allocated range [10 &#x2013; 5] in the log file&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write B is done and returns to the user&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write A is NOT done, and we have a crash&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Basically, we have here a violation of durability, because when we read from the log, we will get to the A write, see it is corrupted and stop processing the rest of the log. Effectively, you have just lost a committed transaction. Now, the log format actually allows that to happen, and a sophisticated reader can recover from that, but I haven&#x2019;t seen yet any signs that that was implemented.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;To be fair, I&#xA0;think&#xA0;that the log reader should be able to handle zero&#x27;ed data and continue forward. There is some sort of a comment about that. But that isn&#x27;t supported by the brief glance that I saw, and more importantly, it isn&#x27;t won&#x27;t help if you crashed midway through writing A, so you have corrupted (not zero&#x27;ed) data on the fie. This would also cause the B transaction to be lost.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The rest appears to be just thread safety and then allowing concurrent writes to the log, which I have issue with, as I mentioned. But I am assuming that this will generate a high rate of writes, since there is a lot less waiting. That said, I am not sure how useful that would be. There is still just one physical needle that writes to the disk. I am guessing that it really depends on whatever or not you need the call to be synced or not. If you do, there are going to be a lot more fsync() than before, when it was merged into a single call.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As mentioned earlier, HyperDex has made some changes to LevelDB to make it work faster for their scenarios. I was curious to see what changed, so I took a look at the code. The fun part is that I can easily check just the things that were changed by HyperDex, I don&#x2019;t need to go read and understand a completely new engine. I&#x2019;m currently just looking at the logs, and noting important stuff. A lot of the work appears to have been concentrated on the notion of compaction. In particular, compaction means that we need to merge multiple files into a single file at a higher level. That is great, until you realize that this may mean that you&#x2019;ll be writing a lot more data than you though you would, because you keep copying the data from one file to another, as it bubbles deeper into the levels. The first thing that seemed to have happened is that when you get to a deep enough level, the file sizes that you are allowed to have become much larger, that means that you&#x2019;ll have more data at higher level and likely reduce the number of times that you need to compact things. The next step in the process was to create two parallel processes. One to handle the common compaction from memory to level-0 and the other to handle level-0 and down. I assume that this was done to avoid contention between the two. It is far more common to have a memory to level-0 compaction than level-0 down, and having to sync between the two is likely causing some slow down. The next change I noticed was tightening locks. Instead of having a single lock that was used for more writes, there now appears to be more granular locks, so you gain more concurrency under parallel load. Next, the change was made to the compaction heuristics. I am not sure that I understand yet the changes, especially since I am just going through the commit log now. Once thing I noticed right away is that they removed the seek budget that you had for files. It appears that compactions triggered by reads were a source of too much pain for HyperDex, so it was removed. Note that HyperDex appears to be very interested in a consistent performance for high write scenarios.  Looking at the logs, it appears that there were a lot of strategies attempted for getting a better compaction strategy for what HyperDex is doing. Interestingly enough (and good for them) I see a lot of back &amp; forth, trying something out, then backing out of it, etc. Sometimes over the courses of several weeks or months. A lot of that appears to be more like heuristically setting various things, like number of compacting threads, the various config options, etc. Trying to find the best match. Another thing that I guess improved performance is that leveldb will intentionally slow down writes when is is doing compaction, or just about to, to reduce the load when heavy background operations are running. HyperLevelDB removed that, so you will have more load on the system, but no artificial governors on the system performance. But coming back to compactions, it appears that what they ended up doing is to have three levels of background compactions.  Memory Table &#x2013;&gt; Level0 files. Optimistic Compaction Background Compaction To be honest, I think that at least between the last two there is a lot of code that can be shared, so it is a bit hard to read, but basically. We have an optimistic compaction thread running that waits for enough data to comes through to level 0, at which point it will try to do a low cost, high yield compaction. If that isn&#x2019;t enough, we have the background compaction that will kick in, but that seems to be for there is really no other alternative. Given the importance of compaction to performance, it would probably make more sense to split them into a separate concept, but I guess that they didn&#x2019;t want to diverge too much from the leveldb codebase.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After having struggled with understanding Paxos for a while, I run into the Raft Draft paper, and I was very impressed. To start with, I have read at least four or five papers about Paxos, read 2 &#x2013; 5 implementations of the algorithm in different languages, implemented it myself, and I am still not really comfortable about it. On the other hand, after doing a single pass through the Raft paper, I have a much greater sense of understanding what it is about, how it works and even how I can implement that, if I want to. Hell, I fully expect to be able to hand that paper to a passerby CS student and get a working implementation without needing to get Sheldon Cooper involved.&#xA0; One thing to note, this paper and algorithm were heavily focused on making this understandable, and I think that they were quite successful in doing that. For that matter, I wish that other papers were this easy to read and follow. Very interesting, and unlike the Paxos paper, immediately and almost painfully obvious how you would actually make use of something like that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Kellabyte rightfully points out that leveldb was designed primarily for mobile devices, and that there have been many things that can be done that weren&#x2019;t because of that design goal. I was already pointed out to HyperDex&#x2019;s port of leveldb, and I am also looking into what Basho is doing with it.  You can read a bit about what HyperDex did to improve things here. And Basho challenges are detailed in the following presentation. The interesting thing about this is why people want to go to leveldb to start with. To put it simply, it is a really good product, in the sense that it is doing what it needs to do, and it is small enough so you can understand it in a reasonably short order. The fun starts when you disagree with the decisions made for you by leveldb, it is actually quite easy to make changes to the root behavior of the project without making significant changes to the overall architecture. Looking over the HyperDex changes overview, it appears that they were able to make very targeted changes. All the hard problems (storing, searching, atomicity, etc) were already solved, now the problem is dealing with optimizing them. I&#x2019;m going to review the changes made by both Basho &amp; HyperDex to leveldb, because I think that it would be a facinating object of study. In particular, I was impressed with how leveldb merged transactions, and I am looking forward at how HyperDex parallelized them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was pointed out to this article about friction in software, in particular, because I talk a lot about zero friction development. Yet the post show a totally different aspect of friction. I would actually agree with that definition of friction. The problem is that there are many types of frictions. There is the friction that you have to deal with when you build a new project, in a new domain or using new technologies, so you need to figure out how to make those things work, and you spend a lot of your time just getting things working. Then there is the friction of the process you are using. If you need to have a work item associated with each commit (and only one commit), it means that you are going to either commit more slowly, or spend a lot more time just writing effectively useless work items. Then you have the friction of the common stuff. If your users require you fairly elaborate validation, even a simple date entry form can become an effort taking multiple days. All of those are various types of frictions. And all of those adds up to the time &amp; cost of building software. I tend to divide them in my head to friction &amp; taxes. Friction is everything that gets in the way unnecessarily. For example, if I need to spend a day making a release, that is friction that I can easily automate. If I need to spend a lot of time on the structure of my software, that is friction. If I have checklists that I need to go through, that is usually friction. Then there are the taxes, stuff that you do because you have to. In my case, this is usually error handling and production readiness, failure analysis and recovery, etc. In other cases this can be i18n, validation or the like. Those are things that you can streamline, but you can&#x2019;t really reduce. If you need to run in a HA environment, you are going to be needing to write the code to do that, and test that. And that ain&#x2019;t friction, even though it slows you down. It is just part of the cost of doing business. And, of course, we have the toll trolls. That is what I call to those things that you don&#x2019;t have to do, but are usually forced upon you. Sometimes it is for a valid reason, but a lot of the time it is Just Because. Example of tolls that are being laid upon software include such things as having to integrate with the CRM / ERP / TLD of the day. Being forced to use a specific infrastructure, even though it is widely inappropriate. And, possibly the best thing ever: &#x201C;I went golfing with Andrew this weekend, and I have great news. We are a Java shop now!&#x201D;</p>
