        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">On October 30, I am going to give a lecture in the Tapuz User Group meeting.&#xA0; The topic of the lecture is &quot;Active Record: How to write less code.&quot;     This is a 101 (introductory) talk, showing what you can do with Active Record and how much more productive it makes you.    There are a couple of nice tools for code generation that I have reviewed recently, but I don&#x27;t think that I am going to go for the flashy screens and the wizards and reams of generated code.     I am going to give a RAD talk without a single wizard...    If you are in Israel, come and tell me how spectacular a failure this is going to be... :-)    P.S: Some poor guy actually asked to reserve two hours of my time to talk about OR/M. I&#x27;m not sure if I should pity him or not...    P.S.S: I&#x27;ll make the slides / code avialable after the lecture.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x27;m listening to DNR #198 at the moment, and Carl compares Ruby to VB6 and says that the main difference is that now we have tests.    I don&#x27;t agree with this statement.    In my opinion, the main problem with VB6 compare to Ruby, JavaScript, Python, or any other dynamically typed langauge, is that the only concession that VB6 had for dynamicasim (is that a word?)&#xA0;was in its typing system. In other words, variant, automatic type conversion and duck typing (to some degree) were the only dynamic features of VB6.    You can&#x27;t extend VB6 in any meaningful way. In a dynamic language, mixin is a natural paradigm, extending classes and objects is a matter of course. Those features give the developer a lot of flexibility to work with. VB6 didn&#x27;t have any of the real advantages fo a dynamic system.    That is also leaving aside the amount of freedom that each language gives the developers. The simplest example that I can think of is JavaScript and alert(). I override this function in my application to provide a dialog box that match the look and feel of the application. I can do it once, and any call to alert() in my application is changed (including library code). I am not familiar with any way to do that in VB6 and MsgBox</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Darrel&#xA0;investigated NHibernate and came back with a Post Traumatic Stress&#xA0;Disorder. The issue he had was with NHibernate&#x27;s Automatic Dirty Checking.    The implementation fo this feature is done by keeping the state of the object when it was loaded from the database inside the session, and comparing the initial data to the current state of the object when flushing. The problem, in Darrel&#x27;s words is:            From my perspective there are two major drawbacks to this approach.&#xA0; First, considering the data you are manipulating is probably consuming the majority of the applications memory, you have double the memory requirements for the writable objects.&#xA0;&#xA0;I am assuming you only take this hit for objects retrieved as writable, but even so, this just seems&#xA0;unreasonable especially considering the fact that many people use Hibernate&#xA0;on a server that is a shared resource!                The second problem is that when doing a flush, it is necessary to do a comparison on each and every entity&#xA0;property.&#xA0; This is necessary&#xA0;even if no changes have been made.        Let me tackle the second problem first. Yes, Flush()ing when you have large number of entities in the session is going to perform poorly. That is why NHibernate provide you with ways to tell it that it shouldn&#x27;t make those checks (calling Evict() on the stuff that you know wasn&#x27;t changed, etc). In practice, you only need to do this in rare cases. Loading large amount of objects, modifying a few and saving them is a use case that doesn&#x27;t turn out that often, in my experiance, and when it does, it is simple to optimize it. If you really wish, you can provide a way (through the interceptor) to tell NHibernate which entities are dirty or not, and save it the effort.    The first problem that Darrel has is with the memory consumtion. I will start right off by saying that I have been a devot user of NHibernate*for over two years now, and I&#x27;m building big, complex systems using it. Memory consumtion was never an issue with NHibernate.&#xA0;Optimizing NHibernate&#x27;s performance is almost solely focused on reducing the amount of queries and getting NHibernate to fetch the data in the most efficent way.    The one time I heard about an issue with memory consumtion and NHibernate, it wasn&#x27;t because of the entities cache, but because the developers had abused NHibernate&#x27;s query translation cache by generating hundreds of thousands of queries from user&#x27;s inputs.    The basic assumption that I contest is that the entities are going to be the majority of the application&#x27;s memory. This is not the case in nearly any application that I know of. Let us say that we have an entity that is 1Kb in size (this is a farily large entity, by the way). Let us say that we have 250 of those in the current request ( again, this is a very big number ). So we have 250Kb for the entities, and another 250Kb for the loaded state. 500Kb is a lot, you say?     Let us try finding other stuff (per request) that has similar size. The first thing that I can think of, of course, is ViewState. I&#xA0;am sure that I am not the only&#xA0;one who got a &quot;WTF is ViewState doing that it is 80% of the page size, including pictures!?&quot;. And, of course, you pay for ViewState&#x27;s (memory-wise)&#xA0;twice, once for the serialized data which remains in the request&#x27;s variables collection until the request ends and once for the de-serialized data.    The page itself and its controlls collection is another very big object. And I am sure that you can see where I am going from here. So, even for a case with a lot of very big entities, I would bet that the other factors in the request would overhsadow the amount of memory consumed by NHibernate by a large precentage.    But, and this is important, since when has memory been a problem for scaling an application? (Leaving aside doing silly stuff like putting a 400Mb dataset per user in the session). I/O is a far bigger factor in scaling applications, especially database I/O.    To conclude, I don&#x27;t see NHibernate&#x27;s Automatic Dirty Checking memory consumtion as a problematic issue. Quite the reverse, actually. You have no idea how powerful this is until you realize that your business logic can do its stuff (and you can test it) completely seperated from the persistance mechanism, and NHibernate will simply pick up the changes and persist them for you.&#xA0;The first time I did it, I felt like I was doing magic.    Oh, and just to point out, there aren&#x27;t really any other way to handle this, expect by doing exactly that. When I spoke with Luca Bolognese about DLinq, he mentioned that it uses basically the same approach to solve this issue.    * Mainly because whenever I stray from the Path I get hit hard on the head by the ADO.Net gods of venegance and boring code.</p>

In the last two days I have been busy moving my current project to using NHibernate 1.2 and dropping all references to NHibernate.Generics in favor of NHibernate 1.2&#x27;s native generics collection.&#xA0;(Finding some horrible business logic inside the Add/Remove delegates that was quite tricky to repreduce reliably).    This project is &quot;mostly read&quot; system, and it feels significantly faster after doing the upgrade.

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Do worry about the title, it isn&#x27;t meant to say anything meaningful.    Ted Neward&#xA0;had posted about the OSS WebCast, and one thing caught my eye:... Scott had mentioned that Corillian (his company) had built an abstraction layer on top of the open-source logging package, log4net. This reminded me so strongly of Commons Logging that I made a comment to that effect, warning that the Java community got itself into trouble (and continues to do so to this day, IMHO) by building abstraction layers on top of abstraction layers on top of abstraction layers, all in the name of &quot;we might want or need to change something... someday&quot;...    I am quite passionate about squashing this tendancy whenever I find it. There is value in abstracting a complex library to a simple set of API, but abstracting the library just because you don&#x27;t want a dependency is going to bite you.    First, your API is going to be limited, since you can&#x27;t make advantage of everything that the library has to offer, and you can&#x27;t just upgrade the library and start using the new features, since you need to decide beforehand if you can the abstraction layer.    Second, API isn&#x27;t the only thing that cause a depenedency. It is the interactions between your code and the library that cause the dependency. To give a simple example, log4net will never throw an exception, the Logging Block from Microsoft will happily throw an exception if it can&#x27;t log, which will kill you application, since you assumed that an exception cannot be thrown from logging calls.    I don&#x27;t even really like the logging services in Castle, for exactly this reason. But in this case, we does have users that need both NLog and log4net, so at least we are dealing with abstracting abstractions into nothingness</p>
