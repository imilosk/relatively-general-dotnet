            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Frans Bouma left the following in this post, which I found quite interesting:     The person who spend a lot of time inside the code base obviously finds it logical and knows his way through the codebase and where to make changes what to avoid etc. For that person, the codebase is maintainable. It is different for a person who&#x27;s new to the codebase. If that person has to spend a lot of time figuring out where what is and most importantly: why, it&#x27;s already a sign things aren&#x27;t as maintainable as it should.   I have to say that I disagree quite strongly with this definition.   Maintainable is a value that can only be applied by someone who is familiar with the codebase. If that someone find it hard to work on the codebase, it is hard to maintain. If someone with no knowledge of a codebase find it hard to work with it, tough luck, but that doesn&#x2019;t say anything about the maintainability of a code base.  A codebase is more than just a code sample, it is conventions, ways of doing things, overall architecture and a sense of how to do things.   Now, there is a separate value, related to how easy it is to bring someone up to speed on the codebase, but that does not relate directly to maintainability.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got a few questions about NHibernate and Silverlight. That is actually a very easy thing to answer.  Don&#x2019;t even try. They don&#x2019;t get along. In fact, they aren&#x2019;t even going to get along.   Silverlight doesn&#x2019;t have System.Data.IDbConnection, and you can safely assume that that it somewhat important to NHibernate.   So, running NHibernate inside a Silverlight application, presumably in order to access a local database is out. But I don&#x2019;t think that this is what most people actually had in mind when they ask about NHibernate and Silverlight. They want to know about NHibernate on the server and Silverlight on the client.  And that is easy enough to answer as well, it is going to work just like any client / server system. All the same rules apply.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The sample application that I am going to build is going to be a prison management application. I am going to take this post as a chance to talk about it a bit, discuss the domain and then I&#x2019;ll talk about the overall architecture in more details.  The domain of a prison is actually fairly simple, you have an inmate, and the sole requirement is that you would keep him (it tend to be overwhelmingly him, rather than her) in lawful custody.  The term lawful custody has a lot of implications, which are, in more or less their order of importance:     The inmate is in custody, that is, he didn&#x2019;t manage to run away.    Custody is lawful, that is, you have legal authorization to keep him in jail. Usually that means an order by a judge, or for the first 24 hours, by a police officer.    Lawful custody itself means that you:         keep the inmate fed      in reasonable conditions (sleeping quarters, sanitation, space)      access to medical facilities. Indeed, in most prisons the inmates get better health care, especially for emergencies, than the people living in most big cities.      ability to communicate with lawyers and family      The devil, however, is in the details. I am pretty sure that I could sit down and write about 250 pages of high level spec for things that are absolutely required for a system that run a prison and still not get everything right.  In practice, at least in the prisons I served at, we did stuff using paper, some VB6 apps &amp; Access, and in one memorable occasion, an entire set of small prisons where running on what amounted to a full blown application written using Excel macros.  Anyway, what I think that I&#x2019;ll do is start with a few modules in the system, not try to build a full blown system.  The modules that I&#x2018;ll start with would be:     Staff &#x2013; Managing the prison&#x2019;s staff. This is mostly for authentication &amp; authorization for now.    Roster &#x2013; Managing the roster of the prisoners, recording Countings, etc.    Legal &#x2013; Managing the legal side of the prisoners, ensuring that there are authorizations for all the inmates, court dates, notifications, etc.    Escort &#x2013; Responsible for actually taking the inmates out for court, medical evacs, releasing inmates, etc.   That is enough for now, for that matter, it is a huge workload already, but that is about the only way in which I can actually have a chance to show a big enough system and the interactions between all the parts.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Ben is pointing out something that I find flat out infuriating, a TFS MVP had removed a comment talking about SVN &amp; Git from his blog with the following explanation:     &#x201C;No offense, but I deleted your comment.&#xA0; I make way too much $$ on Team System training &amp; consulting to go publicly plugging alternative options.&#x201D;   I am&#x2026; disappointed. I started to write shocked, but it is not the first time that I have seen stuff like that happen.  What bothers me even more, if you can&#x2019;t deal with critics on something that you are doing for a living, how can you call yourself an consultant in the field? How can you actually point out the options if you refuse to even look at them or engage in conversation about them.  This make me seriously doubt the professionalism of the person in question, to say the least.     Independent expert? I don&#x2019;t think so.   Real world answers? Hardly.  Update: Ben Day has posted a reply about this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Mike Scott has pointed out a bug in this code, relating to the use of DateTime.Now vs. DateTime.UtcNow, which can cause inaccurate wait durations during daylight change time.    That made me think for a bit, there are things that just naturally make me highly suspicious, because they are a common source for bugs.  Using a WCF service in a using block, creating a session factory, a foreach loop with database calls, a select without a limit clause.  What are the things that cause a flashing neon sign to go through your head when you see them in code? The stuff that you know will have to be re-read twice to make sure it is bug free.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Looking at the responses that I got, I think that there is some basic misunderstanding about the goal of the sample. Some people seems to want this to be a usable product, some even went ahead and specified some&#x2026; interesting requirements.   Unlike Storefront, I don&#x2019;t intend to create something that would be a useful component to take and use, for the simple reason that I don&#x2019;t think that it would allow to show anything really interesting. Any generic component or system has to either make too much assumptions (constrained) or not enough (open ended). I don&#x2019;t care to have to hand wave things too much.  Given that I am a domain expert on exactly two things, and that I am not going to create Yet Another Bug Tracking Application, I think that it is fairly obvious what I have to build.  Macto is going to be a prison management system.   I am going to use it to demonstrate several topics that I have been dealing with lately, among them the concepts &amp; features architecture and how to build scalable systems.  I&#x2019;ll let you stew on that and will post more details about Macto tomorrow.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The most requested feature for NHibernate for the last few years has been Linq support, and it gives me great pleasure to announce the release of NHibernate Linq 1.0 RTM, which you can download from here.  NHibernate Linq support is based on the existing, proven in production, Linq provider in NHibernate Contrib. The plans to overhaul that and merge that into NHibernate&#x2019;s proper for the next release are still active, but the project team feels most strongly that production quality Linq support is something that we ought to provide for our users now.  This Linq release support just about anything that you can do with the criteria API. We do not support group joins or subqueries in select clauses, since they aren&#x2019;t supported by the criteria API. NHibernate&#x2019;s Linq support has been tested (in production!) for the last couple of years, and most people find it more than sufficient for their needs.  We do plan for expanding the Linq support to support more, but the decision has been made that it makes absolutely no sense not to provide an interim, highly capable, release in the meantime for our users.  Enjoy, and happy linqing.  Oh, and I almost forgot, which would have been a shame. Many thanks for Tuna and Chad, for doing the bulk of the work on the provider.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It looks like what people would really like to see is an end to end sample of all the things that I have been talking about lately.  The problem with doing that is the scope that we are talking about here, it is pretty big, and there are some interconnected parts that would be hard to look at in isolation. To make things a little bit more interesting, building a &#x201C;best practice&#x201D; application is dependent on far too many variables.   Given all of that, I decided that I might as well copy a good idea and try to emulate Rob Conery&#x2019;s Storefront series of webcasts. What I absolutely refuse to do, however, is to create Yet Another Online Shop.  Hence, I have another forum, dedicated to this specific task, where you can discuss what you want to see.&#xA0; We need to decide what is the application, what are the requirements, etc.  Please have the conversation in the forum, which would make it easier to track things.  I think that I can promise at least two or three webcasts to come out of it, including the full source code.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just finished listening to this book, and it is&#x2026; quite an interesting one. The basic premise of the book is enough to ensure that it would be interesting:     After the first [alien invasion] enemy landings in 2004, the German chancellor decides, despite fierce opposition, to rejuvenate survivors of the Waffen SS. Eager to redeem their tarnished honor, these veterans display the same steadfastness and fortitude that they did in Russia and Normandy.   I think that just from that, you can understand why it is interesting by default. I have to say, Ringo and Kratman managed to set a very believable world, and the handling of the topic was superb. I am going to have another post about Ringo&#x2019;s style vs. Weber&#x2019;s style, so I&#x2019;ll skip a lot of that discussion in this post.  This is a Good Book, although I have to say, I find it much easier to accept alien invasions than the Judas Maccabiah SS brigade (which appear in the book).  I wonder the affect of Heinlein on Ringo&#x2019;s writing. Some of the themes woven throughout the plot are definitely Heinleinism. The parasitic pacifist and peace through superior firepower, in particular.  I want to say that the book&#x2019;s portrayal of the civilian attitude to the military mindset is unrealistic, but I have to say that unfortunately it isn&#x2019;t so. There are some really stupid people out there.   The one thing that I find totally unrealistic in the book, however, was that political pressure was able to basically castrate the army. Mostly from environmentalist groups and the like. I have no idea how the German political and military game is played, but in most places, there is Peace and there is War. And you don&#x2019;t mess around with the army in a time of war, the army tend to push back on that, and hard.</p>
