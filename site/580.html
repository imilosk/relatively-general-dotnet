            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, you are probably are already aware of the long discussion that I had about it. Patrick was kind enough to help me get to the actual information that I was interested at, and now I can try to talk with concrete data.  The post is based on skimming the following matrix:     But the reason that I am skimming is that the matrix size is just too big to really go over by hand. The matrix is showing dependencies between different types.   Here is an area that seems to be rich in cycles:     Let me list them out for you:     FutureCriteriaBatch and FutureQueryBatch have a cyclic relationship with SessionImpl. There isn&#x2019;t a problem here, since they are considered to be friend classes, they would probably have been defined as inner classes of SessionImpl, if that class wasn&#x2019;t already big enough. So we consider them to be part and parcel of the same thing, since they are tied together very tightly.     SessionFactoryImpl have cyclic relationship with SessionImpl and StatelessSessionImpl. Again, we don&#x2019;t consider this a problem, those classes are tied together by the nature of their existence. SessionFactoryImpl have to be able to create the sessions, and they need to access it to be able to touch everything that isn&#x2019;t session scoped.     MultiCriteriaImpl has a cyclic relation with SessionImpl for much the same reason, SessionImpl is its creator, after which it&#xA0; is using SessionImpl to do a lot of its work.     CritertiaImpl and its inner class, CriteriaImpl.Subcrtieria are also listed as a cycle. In this case, again, I don&#x2019;t have an issue. Especially since inner class relationship already have the concept of a cycle in it.    Here are a few other snapshots:     On the face of it, it looks like a lot of cycles in NHibernate.Type. But again, digging a bit deeper, we can see that there is actually a good reason for those. Customer types needs to be able to create additional types, and it is no great surprise that they use the TypeFactory to do so, or that the TypeFactory can also create them.  Another matrix that looks bad at first glace is this:     Except that every single one of those cyclic dependencies are between a parent class and an inner class.  Now, I don&#x2019;t want to say that there aren&#x2019;t cyclic dependencies in NHibernate that shouldn&#x2019;t be there and need to be removed. But on a(n admittedly short) study, I wasn&#x2019;t able to find a such a case. And the cases that I found had pretty good reasons for behaving the way they do.  Another observation worth noting is that NHibernate is structured using a recursive spoke and wheel approach.     What I mean by that is that we have different types of components all doing their own specific task, and then we have what, for lack of a better word, I&#x2019;ll call orchestrators, which manager a bunch of those components and how they work together.  This continues on recursively, we have orchestrators for orchestrators, until we end up at the pinnacle, with ISession and ISessionFactory.  This design make it pretty easy to add new functionality along existing lines, and adding entirely new functionality is just a matter of deciding where to put things.  One of the things that I most like with NHibernate is that so many features can be implemented using very high level concepts. For example, Futures were extremely easy to implement, because we could take advantage of all the underlying infrastructure.  An implication of this is that when I need to expose something from SessionImpl, for example, which was built mostly using SessionImpl, I am going to have a cycle.  I suggest taking a look at FutureCriteriaBatch and its association to SessionImpl to look at why we have those cycles. I don&#x2019;t believe that you will find them to be a problem after you look at the actual code.  Now, let see how big an ants&#x2019; nest I kicked this time.  Update: Patrick mentioned in the comments that I should also pay attention to direct &amp; indirect usage. The problem is that I don&#x2019;t find it very useful, from the aforementioned reasons. For that matter, when I looked at a few of the &#x201C;trouble spots&#x201D; with direct &amp; indirect usage, I was still not able to point at something that I would consider a problem.   The graph certainly looks scary, isn&#x2019;t it?     But the problem is that I can&#x2019;t find much new information when I dig in. Here are a few examples:     We already talked about SessionImpl and FutureCriteriaBatch, and it doesn&#x2019;t surprise me that IType and ISessionImplementor are tied together. ISessionImplementor needs types to do its work, and IType needs ISessionImplementor to access the services that NHibernate offers internally.   Another one:  &#xA0;   Again, nothing that I didn&#x2019;t know already.  In fact, I&#x2019;ll go a bit further and say that even for indirect only cycles in NHibernate&#x2019;s codebase, the things I said above about direct cycles still hold.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Since I am making so much use of future posts recently, I decided that it would be interesting to have a sidebar that shows the future posts. The problem is that I really don&#x2019;t want to mess around with SubText.  This is not a slight against SubText, it has served me well for a long time. It is simply that for what I wanted, the number of steps that I would have to go through is way too long:     Get the relevant source    Compile it on my machine    Figure out SubText&#x2019;s architecture and where I should make my changes    Upload a new version of the blog engine   It is possible, but it just take too long. Moreover, it would most certainly break the next time that I would update SubText, because I would forget all about it.   But it is not the only way to get stuff done, however. Here is my solution:  Update: I actually had a bug here related to time zone handling, fixed now.  Update 2: I used the 3.5 TimeZone semantics for this, but my server is running 2.0, use an okay hack instead. And fixed potential issue with &lt; &amp; &gt; in the titles.     &lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;C#&quot; %&gt;&#xA;&lt;%@ OutputCache Duration=&quot;60&quot; VaryByParam=&quot;None&quot; %&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;%@ Import Namespace=&quot;System.Data.SqlClient&quot; %&gt;&#xA;&lt;%@ Import Namespace=&quot;System.Configuration&quot; %&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;%&#xA;string connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[&quot;subtextData&quot;].ConnectionString;&#xA;using(SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;connection.Open();&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;using(SqlCommand cmd = connection.CreateCommand())&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;cmd.CommandText = @&quot;&#xA;select top 15 Id, DateSyndicated, Title from subtext_Content&#xA;where DateSyndicated &gt; @nowIsrael&#xA;order by DateSyndicated&#xA;&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;DateTime nowIsrael = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(3);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(&quot;nowIsrael&quot;,nowIsrael);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;using(SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;if(reader.HasRows == false)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;%&gt;&lt;li&gt;Queue is empty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;%&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;while(reader.Read())&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;DateTime dateSyndicated = (DateTime)reader[&quot;DateSyndicated&quot;];&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;string title = (string) reader[&quot;Title&quot;];&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;string formattedSyndication;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;TimeSpan timeLeft = dateSyndicated - DateTime.Now;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;if (timeLeft.Days &gt; 7)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;formattedSyndication = timeLeft.Days / 7 &#x2B; &quot; weeks &quot; &#x2B; timeLeft.Days % 7 &#x2B; &quot; days&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;else if (timeLeft.Days &gt; 0)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;formattedSyndication = timeLeft.Days &#x2B; &quot; days&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;else if (timeLeft.Hours &gt; 0)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;formattedSyndication = timeLeft.Hours &#x2B; &quot; hours&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;else if (timeLeft.Minutes &gt; 0)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;formattedSyndication = timeLeft.Minutes &#x2B; &quot; minutes&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;else&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;formattedSyndication = &quot;In a moment&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;%&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= formattedSyndication %&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;%= Server.HtmlEncode(title) %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;%&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;}&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;%&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And then it was just a matter of changing the template to include the following JavaScript:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  $(&#x27;#futurePosts&#x27;).load(&#x27;http://ayende.com/Blog/FuturePosts.aspx&#x27;);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And that is it.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I commented before that a feature is usually composed of several classes, running in different places and at different times, all working together to achieve a single goal. This post is meant to expand on this notion a bit.  Let us go back to the type of architecture that I favor right now. Note that this is a physical diagram only, without actually going into the details about how each of those is implemented.     Storage, for example, may be a relational database, a key value store, a distributed hash table or something else, depending on&#xA0; the requirements and constraints that I have.  More than anything, this diagram represent physical distribution and setup behavior. For example, you really want to backup all the storage servers, but an application server can just have a image made and that would be it.  The main reason for having a separation between web &amp; app servers is mostly so we can place the web server in the DMZ and the app server in a more trusted location. But I digress.   I mentioned before that I don&#x2019;t really like layering anymore, and that I tend to think hard before I create assemblies.   Here is a sample of some of the ideas that I have been working on lately. The idea is to formalize a lot of the notions that I talked about in my concepts and features post.&#xA0;      You can think about this as a logical extension to the way people build composite applications. We have the infrastructure, the idea of the base services that are being provided by the application, and then we have features.  Each feature is a complete story, which means that a feature will contain, in the same place, all the parts required to make it work. For example, as you can see in the project image, what we have is the Search feature, which contains some UI, the logic to control the UI on the client side and the server side, helper classes to manage that. In the Finders folder we have additional functionality that is specific for this particular feature.  The infrastructure knows that it needs to pull of of that together, so we base everything on conventions. For example, we have a routing convention for aspx pages, and for finding services or controllers.  From layering perspective, there aren&#x2019;t any. Inside a feature, you can do pretty much whatever you want. There is usually some conventions around to help build things properly, but that is mostly about just getting things working, not to support layering. And I don&#x2019;t have a problem with breaking the rules inside a feature.  Features that affect each other are rare. It usually only happen whenever we have to do things like &#x201C;when you search for an order and you go to a particular order, we want to always go back to the search page, no matter how deep we went&#x201D;.  Cross feature communication is done using pub/sub mechanism, most of the time.  Most of the ideas that I outline here are composite applications notions, just applied in a more general fashion. The end result is that you gain all the usual benefits from composite applications. You don&#x2019;t step on another feature toes when you add stuff, and you have a stable base from which to work from. Each feature can be developed independently and is only worried about its own problems. The infrastructure is built during the first few features, but afterward it is mainly a stable platform on top of which we build.   I should note that notion is recursive. That is, we have a feature that keep getting expanded. At that point, we will probably treat it like the entire application, and build the infrastructure in place so we can drop additional features to the root feature. A common example of that would be to support additional authentication mechanisms for the Authentication feature.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Hands down, David Weber is my favorite author. He has the ability to create rich worlds that are complete, logically consisted and interesting. While Weber is mostly known for the Harrington series, which I also really like, I have to say that the Prince Roger books (March Upcountry, etc) are the best military action series that I have read, and that the Safehold series is the best political action series.  Of the two, I actually think that I prefer the Safehold series, although it is a very close match, and I&#x2019;ll likely change my mind if there would be a new book in the series.  All of that said, this book is actually about the latest book in the Safehold series, which includes Off Armageddon Reef and By Schism Rent Asunder. In a single sentence, I can tell you that Weber has managed to capture my interest all over again. His ability to weave so many concurrent plot lines is the key part of the high level of enjoyment (and quality) that I derive from the books.  The one problem that I have, like the one in the previous one, is stops too early! If I were smart, I would probably drop the series for a decade or so, and wait for Weber to pump enough books out that I can get them all in one shot.  That is not to say that the books are too long, or full of fluff. It is just that Weber is painting a big picture, and that takes time. Unfortunately, it means that by the book ends, I was left with quite a desire to known what the hell is going to happen next.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, there is the interesting debate in the comments of this post, and I thought that it might be a good time to talk again about the way I approach building and architecting systems.  Let me tell you a story about a system I worked on. It started as a Big Project for a Big Company, and pretty much snowballed into getting more and more features and requirements as time went by. I started up as the architect and team lead for this project, and I still consider it to be one of the best projects that I worked on and the one that I hold up to compare to others.  Not that it didn&#x2019;t have its problems, for once, I wasn&#x2019;t able to put my foot down hard enough, and we used SSIS on this project. After that project, however, I made a simple decision, I am never going to touch SSIS again. You can&#x2019;t pay me enough to do this (well, you can pay me to do migrations away from SSIS).  Anyway, I am sidetracking, I was on the project for 9 months, until its 1.0 release. At that point, we were over delivering on the spec, we were on schedule and actually under budget. The codebase was around 130,000 lines of code, and consisted of a huge amount of functionality. I was then moved to a horrible nasty project that ended up with me quitting after the first deliverable. The team lead was changed and a few new people were added, in the next 6 months, the code size doubled, velocity remained more or less fixed (and high) and the team released to production on scheduled with very few issues.  I lost touch with the team for a while, but when I reconnected with them, they had switched the entire time again, this time they brought it fully in house, they were still working on it, and a code review that I did revealed no significant deterioration in the codebase, in fact, I was able to go in and look at pieces that were written years after I left the project, and follow the logic and behavior as if no time has passed or the entire team changed.   Oh, and just to make things even more interesting, there were no tests for the entire thing. Not a single one. I did mention that we did frequent releases and had low amount of bugs, right? Yes, I am painting a rosy picture, but I did say that I consider this to be the best project that I was on, now didn&#x2019;t I?  The question arises, how did this happen? And the thing that is responsible for this more than anything else was the overall architecture of the system.   Broadly, it looks like this:     Except that this image is not to scale, here is an image that should give you a better idea about the scales involved:     That tiny red piece there at the bottom? That is the application infrastructure. Usually, we are talking about very few classes. In NH Prof case, for example, there are less than five classes that compose the infrastructure for the main functionality (listener, bus, event processor (and probably another one or two) if you care).  The entire idea was based around something like this:           We had provided a structure for the way that the application was built. The infrastructure was aware of this structure, enforced it and used it. The end result that we ended up with a&#xA0; lot of &#x201C;boxes&#x201D;, for lack of a better word, where we could drop functionality, and it would just pick it up. For example, adding a new page with all new functionality usually consisted of about few things that had to be changed:     Create the physical page &amp; markup     Create the controller for the page     Optional: Create associated page specific markup     Optional: Create associated page specific Json WebService    If new functionality was required in the application core itself, it was usually segregated to one of few functional areas (external integration, business services, notifications, data) and we have checklists for those as well. It was all wired up in such a way that the steps to get something working were:     Create new class     Start using new class (no new allowed, expose as ctor parameter)     Done    The end result was that within each feature box, if you weren&#x2019;t aware of the underlying structure, it would look like a mess. There is not organization at the folder (or namespace), because that wasn&#x2019;t how we thought about those things. What we had was a feature based organization, and a feature usually span several layers of the application and dealt with radically different parts.      Note: Today, I would probably discard this notion of layering and go with slightly different organization pattern for the code, but at the time, I had a strict divide between different parts of the application.    Anyway, because we worked with it that way, the way that we actually approached source code organization was at the feature level. And a feature usually spanned all parts of the application and had to be dealt with at all layers. So let us take the notion of tracking down a feature, and what composed it. We usually started from the outer shell (UI) and moved inward, by simply looking at the referenced . Key part of that was the ability to utilize R#&#x2019;s capabilities for source code browsing.  I&#x2019;ll talk a bit more about this in a future post, because it is not really important for this one.  What is important is that we had two very distinct attributes to the system:     You rarely had to change code. Most of the time, you added code.    There was a well defined structure to the application&#x2019;s features.    The end result that we produced a lot of code, all to the same pattern, more or less, and all of it was isolated from the other code in the same level.  It work, throughout several years of development, several personal change and at least two complete team changes. I just checked, and the team added new features since the last time I visited the site.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The Finance Department in Tel Aviv Municipality has decided to go on a (probably illegal) strike (Hebrew link). Since I don&#x2019;t live in Tel Aviv nor am I a local blogger, there is actually a reason for me pointing it out.  The reason for them being on a strike, especially since it is looks like it is not a legal one? The rollout of a new system is currently going on, and it is painful enough for them to refuse to do any work.  I wonder how bad it is for them to get to that point&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Patrick has a post analyzing the changes to NHibernate 2.1, which I take exception to. Specifically, to this:     Now, the code base is completely entangled and it must be a daily pain to maintain the code. There is a total lack of componentization and each modification might potentially affect the whole code base.   Um&#x2026; not!  The problem with the way things are seen from Patrick&#x2019;s point of view is that his metrics and the metrics used by the NHibernate team are not identical. As a matter of fact, they are widely divergent. This is part of the reason that I tend to use automatic metrics only as tracer bullets in most code review scenarios.   In particular, Patrick uses the notion of namespaces as a layering mechanism, when the codebase doesn&#x2019;t follow that convention, the output is broken. NHibernate doesn&#x2019;t use namespaces as a layering mechanism, hence, the results that Patrick is showing.  Just to give you an idea, we have tens of new features in the new release, and the number of issues have decreased. We are able to make changes, including major ones, with no major problems, and with safety. For that matter, I actually take offence at the notion that NHibernate isn&#x2019;t componentized. It is highly componentized, and we are actually working on making this even more so, by adding additional extension points (like the pluggable proxies, object factories, and more).  There is no question about NHibernate being complex, but in the last year or so we have taken on several new committers, drastically increased the number of new features that we ship and have maintained a high code quality. For that matter, we were able to finally resolve some long standing code quality issues (three cheers for the death of the NHibernate.Classic.QueryParser, and many thanks to Steve Strong for the ANTLR HQL parser)!  There are a few other issues that I would like to point out as well:     Methods added or changed represent 67% of the code base!   A lot of those are the result of internal refactoring that we do, a good example is the move to strongly typed collections internally, or renaming classes or methods to better match their roles. Those are, generally speaking, safe changes that we can do without affecting anyone outside of NHibernate Core. That helps us keep the high level of code quality over time.     30 public types were removed which can then constitute a breaking change.   Again, here we have a more complex scenario than appears upfront. In particular, NHibernate uses a different method for specifying what a breaking change is. By default, we try to make NHibernate extensible, so if you need to make changes to it, you can do that. That means we make a distinction between Published for Inheritance, Published for Use and Public.  For example, we guarantee compatibility for future version if you inherit from EmptyInterpcetor, but not if you implement IInterceptor. By the same token, we guarantee compatibility if you use ISession, but not if you try to implement it. And then there are the things that are public, extensible by the user, but which we do not guarantee which be compatible between versions. Dialect are a good example of that.  This approach means that we have a far greater control over the direction of NHibernate, and it has stood for us throughout 4 major releases of the project.  As for how we measure code quality in NHibernate? We measure it in:     Peer code review (especially for things that are either tricky or complex)    Reported bugs    Ease of change over time    Quality of deliverable product   So far, even if I say so myself, I have to say that there is good indication that we are successful in maintaining high quality codebase. Complex, yes, but high quality, easy to change and easy to work with.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note: I thought about trying to find a more PC title for this post, but I don&#x2019;t think that I can really find a good one that express the same emotional content and the punch that this title have.   A few weeks ago I got my first interesting cold call (someone calling me from the number in the blog without some previous acquaintance), cold calling doesn&#x2019;t happen very often (maybe 5 &#x2013; 7 times in the 5 years I had the number there), but that was the first time that I actually got to talk to someone about an interesting and relevant problem.  Anyway, they were building a multi tier system using NHibernate, and they were running into problems with lazy loading over WCF. I quickly pointed out that I really don&#x2019;t like this approach, it has more than technological faults, it has serous architectural issues.  But let us try to get some idea about how they structured they application. It looked something like this:     I think that you can figure out how a normal request would work, but let me spell it out for you.     Please note that this diagram shows the communication between tiers, that is, each of those is a separate machine.  The idea, as far as I could understand, was to use NHibernate in the Data tier, to get entities from the database and then send them to the business tier where it would do business logic processing, after which it may return it back to the Data tier, which would write them to the database.   I was&#x2026; at a loss for some time, trying to find a way to explain how screwy this architecture was. It quickly became evident that while the guy on the other side of the line wasn&#x2019;t aware of my reservations, he certainly felt the pain of this type of architecture:     Slow response times     Lazy loading over WCF     Need to handle change tracking on the Business tier    Those are the problem that they already experienced directly. I can add a few more:     Anemic domain model (by design!)    Required manual caching    Required distributed transactions    Cascading failure scenarios   I think that I&#x2019;ll stop here, but I am pretty sure that I can come up with a bigger list if I put my mind to it.  My questions about how did they come up with this architecture were mostly answered with: &#x201C;that is how we do things&#x201D; and &#x201C;security&#x201D;.  To add insult to injury, naturally the developers are running it all on a single machine, so they aren&#x2019;t actually seeing what it going on there.  Here is how I would build such a system:     Note that I don&#x2019;t have a Business tier or a Data tier, I have an Application tier. From my experience, even under fairly strict regulatory compliance rules, application servers can call the database, so the security aspect is covered. What we are actually doing, however, is a far more significant change.  We don&#x2019;t need to worry about:     lazy loading (NHibernate does it for us)    change tracking (NHibernate does it for us)    caching (NHibernate does it for us, mostly)    reduced number of hops    no need for distributed transactions    reduced number of failure points    have a chance to build a true domain model   As I mentioned before, I don&#x2019;t even like the distinction between BAL and DAL, even when they are layers, instead of tiers. Trying to make them into tiers is going to cause quite a lot of pain. In essence, and the main thing that is being missed here, is that you are going to have to build some infrastructure to deal with the data at the Business tier. That may be just simple change tracking and DTC support, but it is likely that you&#x2019;ll need more than that for real world applications. Caching and lazy loading are both topics that you&#x2019;ll need to deal with, and neither is going to be an easy task.  This is what NHibernate is meant to do. People keep looking at NHibernate and seeing the Row &lt;- -&gt; Entity conversion, but that is just the very tip of a very big iceberg.     Most of the complexity within NHibernate is with things like caches, lazy loading and change tracking. That is where you are going to see the really significant time and complexity saving.  When you are forcing an architecture into that mode, you are basically removing a lot of the functionality already in the box, and forcing yourself to create it from scratch.   Instead of castrating your abilities, make sure that your architecture matches them, don&#x2019;t play to your weaknesses, play to your strengths.</p>
