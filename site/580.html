            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">With the release of NH Prof v1.0, I started to look if I can extend what I am doing for NHibernate for other OR/M in the .NET space. My initial spiking makes me optimistic, this is certainly possible. I&#x2019;ll probably talk at length about the actual architectural implementation, but for now I want to concentrate on the actual high level requirements. I want to be able to support the following:     Linq to SQL    SubSonic    LLBLGen    Plug your own DAL   While none of them are going to provide me with the detailed information that I can get from NHibernate, it turns out that I can get a pretty good mileage from just pushing the basics along. The first spikes with Linq to SQL are promising (more about that will show up starting next week or the one after that), and I intend to allow you to:     Show DataContext     Show SQL Statements         Show you the actual formatted SQL, including parameters      Show you the stack trace of where that SQL was generated       Generate alerts for bad practices such as SELECT N&#x2B;1 or issuing too many queries   There are things that I can do with NHibernate that are simply not possible with other OR/Ms (something like tracking loaded entities per session, for example, or showing cached queries), but since most of those are actually capabilities that NHibernate has and the others do not, I think it is still great.  Currently the plan is to have a separate product for each OR/M, that means that buying NH Prof will not get you L2S Prof, but we will most likely have some uber license that will cover all of them.   You&#x2019;ll notice that the Entity Framework isn&#x2019;t listed in my initial targets list. That is for a very simple reason, plugging into EF seems to be about nine times harder than doing it with anything else. I would need to get a strong feedback that this is something that enough people are willing to pay for.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Mike Rettig has left a somewhat snarky comment on a post detailing a deadlock issue that I run into:     Locking on shared state? I thought you were a proponent of message based concurrency.&#xA0; This post demonstrates exactly why concurrency combined with shared state is so hard.     Looking forward to your next thread race or deadlock,   The problem with message passing concurrency is that the underlying assumption here is that there isn&#x2019;t any shared state. But in my situation, that is no a valid assumption.  Let us see if I can give a good example of what I mean. Let us assume that we have a message passing the exchange the following messages:     Session Created { Session Id }    Statement Executed { Session Id, Statement Text }    Query Sessions And Statements { }   Furthermore, you are not going to be make use of something like a DB to manage the state (which would handle the sharing issue for you), you have to manage everything in memory.  I would be very interested in hearing how you can design such a system without having shared state and locking.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was a bit quite on the NH Prof front lately, not because I didn&#x2019;t work on it, but because I was fighting a really nasty bug. The way NH Prof is making use of WPF exposed a memory leak scenario inside WPF.  Luckily, once we were able to isolate the actual problem, it was relatively easy to find a workaround. If you care, the resolution was to keep a single instance bound to the view and replace its values, instead of providing a new instance when replacement was required. The problem is that this bug took forever to isolate.   Also included are a bunch of performance optimizations that I did along the way to resolve the OOM error. Those relate to better handling of batch statements, caching the result of SQL parsing and optimized NH Prof&#x2019;s idle state (I&#x2019;ll have a separate post about that).  In addition to that, I gave some additional love to DDL statements, making sure that NH Prof treated them specially and didn&#x2019;t generate DML errors for DDL statements. Same goes for cached statements.  It is a bunch of small changes, the biggest of them was tracking down and viciously attacking the OOM error. For the next week, I am going to be busy at JAOO, but I also intend to spend some free time continuing the final polishing &amp; touch ups.  The week after that, I intend to seriously start working on the 1.1 feature set.  Should be interesting.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is just something that came up recently in a mailing list, we were talking about copyright, ownership and such. The topic of who owns the code you write on your own time (and on your own machines) came up.  The opinion of some people was that the employer may own the code even under those circumstances. It seems that it isn&#x2019;t usually part of the law (that depend on where you are at, of course), but it is part of standard employment contract templates.   When I started looking for a job, I insisted on taking the employment contract home and going over it with:     a calm mind    having another set of eyes go over it   I had one case of not properly reading what I was signing on with bad consequences, I learned since then.  There is no such thing as a standard contract, you can always negotiate.   For that matter, I rejected an offer from one place after verbal agreements that we reached didn&#x2019;t get into the contract (twice!). I decided that if they were trying to effectively cheat me when I wasn&#x2019;t even working for them, I had better things to do than to put my head into this sickbed.  Some of the things that I found in employment contracts are of the sort that would make your head curl. Non compete agreements that basically say that you are not allowed to do any work (for anyone) for 2 years after you stop working for the company. Ownership on anything you do (be in software artifacts, a book about flowers and quite possibly any children you have during your employment terms).  Some of them are unenforceable at court, but you would be at a much better position if you didn&#x2019;t have to deal with annoying section in a contract that you are signed on in the first place.  My usual approach to reading contracts is to debug them, assuming that the other side is nefarious, evil, double dealing and likes kicking puppies before breakfast. Most places will go with the &#x201C;Try and you shall succeed&#x201D; method for contracts. If you signed on to them without complaints, they are good. If you object to something, they can amend the contract to be more reasonable. It isn&#x2019;t that they are nefarious, or that they even plan to act according to the contract. But it is best if they don&#x2019;t have any leverage on you.  An interesting point that I run into is that it is often useful to be bold when negotiating a contract. I deleted the non compete clause for my employment contract when I viewed it, and required a lot of clarifications about what of my work amounts to company&#x2019;s property. I followed the same logic as they did, &#x201C;Try and you shall succeed&#x201D;, if they didn&#x2019;t care about that, I was good.   We ended up with a 1 year limitation for clients that they sent me to, and agreeing that any software work that I am making on the company&#x2019;s time or using their equipment belong to the company, which I considered reasonable.   Not reading the contract is a crime, once you did, be very careful in deciding what is acceptable and what isn&#x2019;t. And if you are already signed on a contract, make sure that you know what is in it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In a comment to one of my posts, Dave Mertens said:     I often wish I had the luxury the throw away the current code and start from scratch. Why. Because my manager ask me how long it takes to fix just this bug. 80% of the bugs (luckily we don&#x27;t have that many bugs) are fixed within 2 hours including writing tests. Than he asks me how long it takes to rewrite the damn code.     It is interesting to note that the questions you ask select the answers you want.  When you give someone a choice between 2 hours of fixing code vs. 3 days of fixing code, the decision is always going to be in favor of 2 hours.  At one point in my life I was asked if I stopped beating up people. This is a twist on the old &#x201C;have you stopped beating your wife yet? yes/no&#x201D; question. I answered in Mu. Then I spent another ten minutes explaining what I meant.     When someone asks me those types of questions, I correct the question, before I answer. Because while you may ask questions to lead the answer in a certain way, there is nothing that says that I must go that way.  The right question is: How often are we hitting on bugs for this same code path? Then asking about how long it takes to fix the whole damn thing.  Oh, and make sure that you can fix it. There is nothing a business likes less than spending time &amp; money on solving a problem and ending up not solving it. Leaving aside what it does to your credibility and the trust relationship with the business.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most annoying bug reports that we got for NH Prof is that it crash with out of memory exception after long use. We did the usual checkups, and the reason for the memory leak was obvious, something kept a lot of objects internal to WPF in memory. In fact, here are the heavy hitters, as extracted from the dump:              Count        Size (kliobytes)        Type                  5,844        3,337        System.Byte[]                  69,346        5,474        System.String                  49,400        37,198        System.Object[]                  1,524,355        47,636        MS.Utility.SingleItemList`1[[System.WeakReference,mscorlib]]                  3,047,755        71,432        MS.Internal.Data.ValueChangedEventArgs                  1,523,918        71,434        MS.Utility.ThreeItemList`1[[System.WeakReference,mscorlib]]                  3,048,292        71,444        MS.Utility.FrugalObjectList`1[[System.WeakReference,mscorlib]]                  3,048,292        95,259        System.Windows.WeakEventManager&#x2B;ListenerList                  3,047,755        166,674        MS.Internal.Data.ValueChangedEventManager&#x2B;ValueChangedRecord                  3,056,462        191,029        System.EventHandler                  7,644,217        238,882        System.WeakReference          As you can see, this just says that we are doing something that cause WPF to keep a lot of data in memory. In fact, this looks like a classic case of &#x201C;memory leak&#x201D; in .NET, where we aren&#x2019;t releasing references to something. This usually happen with events, and it was the first thing that I checked.  It took a while, but I convinced myself that this wasn&#x2019;t that. The next step was to try to figure out what is causing this. I&#x2019;ll skip the sordid tale for now, I&#x2019;ll queue it up for posting at a later date. What we ended up with is a single line of code that we could prove caused the issue. If we removed it, there was no leak, if it was there, the leak appeared.  That was the point where I threw up my hands and asked Christopher to look at this, I couldn&#x2019;t think of something bad that we were doing wrong, but Christopher and Rob are the experts in all things WPF.  Christopher managed to reproduce this in an isolated fashion. here is how it goes:                 public class TestModel : INotifyPropertyChanged{    private readonly DispatcherTimer timer;    private int count;    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged = delegate { };    public TestModel()    {        timer = new DispatcherTimer(DispatcherPriority.Normal)                    {                        Interval = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(50)                    };        timer.Tick &#x2B;= Timer_Tick;        timer.Start();    }    public IEnumerable Data    {        get        {            return new[]            {                new {Name = &quot;Ayende&quot;},            };        }    }    private void Timer_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)    {        if (count&#x2B;&#x2B; % 100 == 0)        {            GC.Collect(2, GCCollectionMode.Forced);            Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0:#,#}&quot;, Process.GetCurrentProcess().WorkingSet64);        }        PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(&quot;Data&quot;));    }}&#xA;    &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is a pretty standard model, showing data that updates frequently. (The short time on the time is to show the problem in a short amount of time.) Note that we are being explicit about forcing a GC release here, to make sure it isn&#x2019;t just waste memory that haven&#x2019;t been reclaimed yet.&#xA;&#xA;And the XAML:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &lt;Grid&gt;    &lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding Data}&quot;&gt;        &lt;ItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;            &lt;DataTemplate&gt;                &lt;StackPanel Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot;&gt;                    &lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{Binding Name}&quot; /&gt;                &lt;/StackPanel&gt;            &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;        &lt;/ItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;    &lt;/ItemsControl&gt;&lt;/Grid&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Executing this will result in the following memory pattern:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Looking at the code, I really don&#x2019;t see anything that is done wrong there. &#xA;&#xA;I uploaded a sample project that demonstrate the issue here.&#xA;&#xA;Am I going crazy? Am I being stupid? Or is select really broken?</p>

I more or less expected to get responses like that, which was why I was hesitant to&#xA0; post it. Contrary to popular opinion, I don&#x2019;t really enjoy being controversial.   There are two main points that I object to in his post:     You see, Ayende appears to say that if you&#x27;re smart enough, you&#x27;ll just know what code to write, just like that. Ergo, if you don&#x27;t know, maybe you&#x27;re not that smart and hence you would need this technique for losers called Test Driven Design/Development.   That is not what I said, please don&#x2019;t put words in my mouth. What I said was: &#x201C;The idea behind TDD is to use the tests to drive the design. Well, in this case, I don&#x2019;t have any design to drive.&#x201D; Combine this with my concepts &amp; features architecture, where the main tenets is: &#x201C;A feature creation may not involve any design activity.&#x201D; and it should be clear why TDD simply doesn&#x2019;t work for my scenario.   And his attack on Rhino Mocks:     Moq vs Rhino Mocks: he [Ayende, it seems] read the (useless IMO) literature on mocks vs stubs vs fakes, had apparently a clear idea of what to do, and came up with Rhino&#x27;s awkward, user unfriendly and hard to learn API with a myriad of concepts and options, and a record-replay-driven API (ok, I&#x27;m sure it was not his original idea, but certainly it&#x27;s his impl.) which two years ago seemed to him to stand at the core of mocking. Nowadays not only he learned what I&#x27;ve been saying all along, that &quot;dynamic, strict, partial and stub... No one cares&quot;, but also is planning to remove the record / playback API too.   This is just full of misinformation. Let me see how:     Rhino Mocks is 5 years old.     Rhino Mocks came out for .NET 1.0.    Rhino Mocks actually predate most of the mocks vs. stubs debate.   I keep Rhino Mocks updated as new concepts and syntax options comes. Yes, AAA is easier, but AAA relies on having the syntax options that we have in C# 3.0. Rhino Mocks didn&#x2019;t start from there, it started a lot earlier, and it is a testament to its flexibility that I was able to adapt it to any change along the way.  Oh, and Rhino Mocks was developed with TDD, fully. Still is, for that matter. So I find it annoying that someone attacks it on this grounds without really understanding how it worked.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Sometimes I read something and I just know that responding off the cuff would be a big mistake. Joel&#x2019;s latest essay, duct tape programmers, is one such case.  I many ways, I feel that this and this says it all:    Sometimes I feel like Joel is on a quest to eradicate good design practices.   Let us start from where I do agree with him. Yes, some people have a tendency to overcomplicate things and code themselves into a corner. Yes, you should keep an eye on your deadlines and deliver.   But to go from there to disparage good practices? To actually encourage brute force hacking?   I think that Joel&#x2019;s dream developer is the guy that keep copy/pasting stuff he finds on the web until it looks like it is working. At the very least, it will make sure that his bug tracking system is used.  And the examples that he gives?     Here&#x2019;s what Zawinski says about Netscape: &#x201C;It was decisions like not using C&#x2B;&#x2B; and not using threads that made us ship the product on time.&#x201D;   Oh, wait, let me see. Netscape is the company that:     Routinely shipped a browser that kept crashing    Wasn&#x2019;t able to compete with IE    Got their source code into a bad enough shape that they had to rewrite it from scratch and lose 5 &#x2013; 6 YEARS doing so    Collapsed   Yep, sounds like this duct tape notion really worked out for them, no?  Here is the deal, every tool and approach can be overused.           But that is part of being a professional, you have to how to balance things. I am not sure what bee got in Joel&#x2019;s bonnet, but it sure seems to cause him to have a knee jerk reaction whenever good design principles are discussed.  Shipping software is easy, you can cobble together something that sort of works and you have a shipping product. People will even buy it from you. All you have to do is look around and see it.  The hard part is to keep releasing software, and with duct tape, your software will be taken away from you by software protective services.     Don&#x2019;t, just don&#x2019;t.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I originally titled this blog post: Separate the scenario under test from the asserts. I intentionally use the terminology scenario under test, instead of calling it class or method under test.   One of the main problem with unit testing is that we are torn between competing forces. One is the usual drive for abstraction and eradication of duplication, the second is clarity of the test itself. Karl Seguin does a good job covering that conflict.  I am dealing with the issue by the simple expedient of forbidding anything but asserts in the test method. And no, I don&#x2019;t mean something like BDD, where the code under test is being setup in the constructor or the context initialization method.  I tend to divide my tests code into four distinct parts:     Scenario under test    Scenario executer    Test model, represent the state of the application    Test code itself, asserting the result of a specific scenario on the test model   The problem is that a single scenario in the application may very well have multiple things that we want to actually test. Let us take the example of authenticating a user, there are several things that happen during the process of authentication, such as the actual authentication, updating the last login date, resetting bad login attempts, updating usage statistics, etc.  I am going to write the code to test all of those scenarios first, and then discuss the roles of each item in the list. I think it will be clearer to discuss it when you have the code in front of you.  We will start with the scenarios:          public class LoginSuccessfully : IScenario{    public void Execute(ScenarioContext context)    {        context.Login(&quot;my-user&quot;,&quot;swordfish is a bad password&quot;);    }}public class TryLoginWithBadPasswordTwice : IScenario{    public void Execute(ScenarioContext context)    {        context.Login(&quot;my-user&quot;,&quot;bad pass&quot;);        context.Login(&quot;my-user&quot;,&quot;bad pass&quot;);    }}public class TryLoginWithBadPasswordTwiceThenTryWithRealPassword : IScenario{    public void Execute(ScenarioContext context)    {        context.Login(&quot;my-user&quot;,&quot;bad pass&quot;);        context.Login(&quot;my-user&quot;,&quot;bad pass&quot;);        context.Login(&quot;my-user&quot;,&quot;swordfish is a bad password&quot;);    }}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And a few tests that would show the common usage:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    public class AuthenticationTests : ScenarioTests{    [Fact]    public void WillUpdateLoginDateOnSuccessfulLogin()    {        ExecuteScenario&lt;LoginSuccessfully&gt;();                Assert.Equal(CurrentTime, model.CurrentUser.LastLogin);    }        [Fact]    public void WillNotUpdateLoginDateOnFailedLogin()    {        ExecuteScenario&lt;TryLoginWithBadPasswordTwice&gt;();                Assert.NotEqual(CurrentTime, model.CurrentUser.LastLogin);    }    [Fact]    public void WillUpdateBadLoginCountOnFailedLogin()    {        ExecuteScenario&lt;TryLoginWithBadPasswordTwice&gt;();                Assert.NotEqual(2, model.CurrentUser.BadLoginCount);    }    [Fact]    public void CanSuccessfullyLoginAfterTwoFailedAttempts()    {        ExecuteScenario&lt;TryLoginWithBadPasswordTwiceThenTryWithRealPassword&gt;();                Assert.True(model.CurrentUser.IsAuthenticated);    }}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, each of the tests is pretty short and to the point, there is a clear distinction between what we are testing and what is being tested.&#xA;&#xA;Each scenario represent some action in the system which we want to verify behavior for. Those are usually written with the help of a scenario context (or something of the like) with gives the scenario access to the application services required to perform its work. An alternative to the scenario context is to use a container in the tests and supply the application service implementations from there.&#xA;&#xA;The executer (ExecuteScenario&lt;TScenario&gt;() method) is responsible for setting the environment for the scenario, executing the scenario, and cleaning up afterward. It is also responsible for any updates necessary to get the test model up to date.&#xA;&#xA;The test model represent the state of the application after the scenario was executed. It is meant for the tests to be able to assert against. In many cases, you can use the actual model from the application, but there are cases where you would want to augment that with test specific items, to allow easier testing.&#xA;&#xA;And the tests, well, the tests simple execute a scenario and assert on the result.&#xA;&#xA;By abstracting the execution of a scenario into the executer (which rarely change) and providing an easy way of building scenarios, you can get very rapid feedback into test cycle while maintaining testing at a high level.&#xA;&#xA;Also, relating to my previous post, note what we are testing here isn&#x2019;t a single class. We are testing the system behavior in a given scenario. Note also that we usually want to assert on various aspects of a single scenario as well (such as in the WillNotUpdateLoginDateOnFailedLogin and WillUpdateBadLoginCountOnFailedLogin tests).</p>
