            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In most of my applications, I tend to work according to a method that I call zones of quality.  Case in point, I am currently writing an application that does [doesn&#x27;t really matter]. This application needs data entry screens to get data in, but while data entry is a big and complex topic, it is not something that is even remotely related to the real business value in the system. For that matter, a lot of the domain logic of the system is secondary and only there as a supporting role. So I give them both the exact same treatment: Quick &amp; dirty implementation that will move them out of the way and allow me to focus on the real business value.   Once I get that out of the way, we know that the system can work as needed, all we need to do now is replace the quick &amp; dirty implementation with a production ready one. This is often a tedious process, but a very straightforward one. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend time &amp; effort on external concerns of a system until you have gotten the main one down pat.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am doing a spike in ASP.Net MVC now (and I&#x27;ll talk about this at length at another time). I hit the wall when I wanted to do something that is trivially simple in MonoRail, limit a routing parameter to be a valid integer. Luckily, just looking at the API signature told me that this is a supported scenario:  Unfortunately, that is all that it told me. This method accept an object. And there is no hint of documentation to explain what I am suppose to do with it. A bit of thinking suggested that I am probably supposed to pass an anonymous type with the key as the route parameter and the value is some sort of a constraint. But what sort of a constraint.   Type information is one of those things that static language actually do, and from experience in both dynamic and static languages, while it is often a PITA to specify types, it actually help for people who read the code. Not often, I&#x27;ll admit, but it is helpful for the uninitiated. I am... unused to having this type of problem in C#.  So I did what any developer would do, hit google and tried to find some information about it. Didn&#x27;t work. I pulled reflector and started to track down what is going on there. Following a maze of untyped paths that I have not seen the like since the 1.1 days, I finally figured out that the value that I need to push is an instance of IRouteConstraint. Obvious, isn&#x27;t it? In short, and the reason of this post. I am seeing a lot of parameter signatures that look like that, and have barely defined semantics. I would file this under C#.Abuse();</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I spent election night in NYC, and was in Times Square when CNN announced that Obama won. I don&#x27;t have any emotional attachment to any candidate, but from the looks of things, just about everyone in NYC was cheering for Obama. The excitement was literally visible in the air.&#xA;I saw people dancing in the street and crying when the announcement was made. I also got to watch both candidate speeches, and I think that they did a good job (based on watching a single speech from each). Obama can talk. Watching his victory speech, I was impressed not by the content, but by his oratory skills.&#xA;People kept throwing &quot;historic event&quot; whenever I walked, and I think that I concur, I am happy to be there when I was, and I certainly going to remember this for a long time.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Yesterday I was at the PhizzPop design party in New York. The purpose of the party was to show off the capabilities of the new Expression 2.0 product line. The way chosen to do so was by getting several companies to participate in a content to get the best result. It might have been a good idea, but it back fired tremendously.&#xA;One of the reasons that I went to that party was the expectation that I would be impressed by the new capabilities. Instead, what I saw there was... disappointing.&#xA;The best candidate application there was adequate. In fact, it was pretty good, but not nearly good enough to take part in a design contest. It is bad when I, a developer with negative UI sense, can spot problematic UI and see how they had to fight with the platform to get it to do things.&#xA;And that was the best they had. One of the other application (in a design contest!) had a RadioButton1, RadioButton2 and other things like that showing. They could literally not be bothered to change something as basic as that.&#xA;I was very disappointed, and the impression that I got from the entries in the contest is that the platform is a really lousy one. Especially considering the amount of time that was supposedly invested on the entries.&#xA;To conclude, I want to quote myself: &quot;I know of people who can do better and faster than that drunk, and while writing the XAML on a stone tablet with a chisel.&quot;&#xA;Very disappointing.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">NH Prof has reached the level in which I can actually talk about the features that it has in more than abstract terms. There is still a big feature area that I want to cover (which should be a nice surprise), but the basics are there, and today I had ample proof that it is maturing just nicely. I was able to deal with quite a few of the remaining tasks by applying check listing. Basically, to do X, I had to do A,B &amp; C. Trivially simple, and quite satisfying.&#xA;Test coverage went back up to over 90% on the backend again, which is also nice.&#xA;Anyway, let us start with the tour, shall we?&#xA;&#xA0; &#xA;The left upper pane shows the captured sessions. You can see the number of statements per each session, as well as the length time it was open.&#xA0; Let us move down a bit, and explore statistics.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;The session factory statistics pane include a lot of information about NHibernate, which can give you a good indication about what is going on in the application in a global fashion. In 2.0 we have quite a few data points, but the statistics feature was significantly expanded in 2.1, and contains a lot more data and more finely grained statistics.&#xA;But that is probably not what gets you excited. What is likely to thrill you are the statement view.&#xA;&#xA;I put a lot of though into designing those (well, into thinking about them, the actual design was handled by people who actually know what they are doing, design wise). The upper section of the screen is optimized to allow the human eye to quickly scan it in order to find all sorts of interesting patterns. Compare this to SQL Profiler UI, and you can see why I think that this is a much better version, just from that stand point.&#xA;The bottom half, however, is what I really like. This is the part I use the most often, in order to really see what is going on. I did an ad-hoc demo of the profiler in Dallas, and one of the things that cam out of this was the format that you see on the lower pane. This UI is set to allow you to just copy the query from the profiler and immediately execute a readable, easy to understand query on Management Studio or Toad. Again, another piece where I think that I providing a lot more value than SQL Profiler does.&#xA;For quick reference, we put the parameter values on the left of the query, so you can inspect them without having to go into a potentially complex queries to try to figure out what is what.&#xA;But this isn&#x27;t where it ends, let us take a look at the stack trace tab:&#xA; &#xA;The stack trace will let you correlate a query and the code that generated it, and not only that, it will take you directly from the query to the code (opening visual studio, loading the file and landing you directly in the place in the code that caused this query to be executed.&#xA;Oh, and one more thing...&#xA; &#xA;I have over four years of experience working with NHibernate, a time during which I learned quite a bit about what work, what doesn&#x27;t and what kind of things we should be aware off. The profiler has given me the chance to codify a lot of these patterns, and put them in a way that allow you to have apply early detection and prevention mechanisms.&#xA;And one last thing, this time it will really be the last. Session / Entity inspection:&#xA; &#xA;You can see exactly what are the entities that were loaded by this session, including counts per entity and all the ids that were loaded. &#xA;I hope to be able to open it for beta testing in two to three weeks, and a 1.0 release about a month after that. Pricing is tentatively set at 200$ per user, but this is subject to change.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In normal systems, when we want to understand what is going on, or to investigate a problem, we have a really simple option, just debug it until you have found the root cause. This is so common that we actually have best practices against being too dependent on the debugger.&#xA;I think that we can all agree that the industry is going more and more toward parallelism. And distributed applications are more and more common. This present an interesting problem for us when we come to understand &amp; troubleshoot a system. It is no longer possible to simply step through the code as it is executing and thus gain the knowledge that we need in order to understand exactly what is going on.&#xA;In order to understand these kind of systems, we need to develop new tools and approaches. Microsoft already did some of that when they built web services for .Net. It is literally possible to debug through a web service call and move from the client to the server (assuming that they are on the same machine) just by pressing F11.&#xA;This doesn&#x27;t really work for most scenarios, however, a common example is a system that is distributed in both time and space (imagine an authorization process that can take minutes or hours). Or a system where the stream of messages is simply too high to be able to individually understand.&#xA;In order to deal with this type of systems, we need to go a long way back. Sometimes before we had debuggers, we still needed a way to figure out what is going on, and we found it.&#xA;Welcome to printf() debugging (or Response.Write debugging, if you prefer it this way).&#xA;And no, we are not quite in the same position, but we are close. One of the main problems here is the fact that we need to coordinate several different machines and correlate between work done on different times and with different capacity.&#xA;WCF calls this end to end logging, and achieve this by attaching a guid that you have to carry around, plus some tools that allow you to merge different logging files to give a unified view across systems.&#xA;BizTalk has the notion of Business Activity Monitoring, and other tools share the same concept. All of them are based on the notion of a common id that spans multiple messages and can be used across machines to get a single view of the entire set of actions.&#xA;In a world that is fast become more and more distributed, such tools are quickly becoming essentials, and I foresee quite a few best practices that will be aimed solely at ensuring that we keep that single thread of traceability in place.&#xA;I find it quite amusing that we are basically going back to reading log files to figure out what is going on with our applications. Of course, there are logs and there are logs, and I&#x27;ll talk about logging &amp; auditing in a lot more detail in a future post.&#xA;&#xA;Messaging</p>
