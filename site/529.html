            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I designed Raven, one of the things that were very clear to me was that I wanted to be able to take advantage on existing features in the framework to the greatest degree possible. This means that I don&#x2019;t have to reinvent the wheel, and it means that Raven&#x2019;s users will be able to understand what is going on and how to utilize Raven much more easily.  One of those decisions was to use Linq as the format for defining indexes. All other document databases use Javascript as their index definition format (yes, I know you can use Ruby for CouchDB, that isn&#x2019;t the default / common approach). But .NET already has this nice syntax, and it already gives me so much information OOTB, and users already know how to make linq do all sort of crazy stuff. That reduce support questions, not to mention that it is a sexy little feature.  We are running those linq queries on the server (doing dynamic compilations and a bunch of other stuff). The problem is how to get them to the server. We have a really nice UI, to do so, of course:   But when it comes right down to it, it is a couple of text boxes, and users may want to be able to define indexes via code. That is perfectly understandable, but it means that users have to do something like this:     documentStore.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(&#xA;    &quot;UsersByRegion&quot;,&#xA;    new IndexDefinition()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = @&quot;from user in docs.Users select new {user.Region}&quot;,&#xA;    });&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;If you cringe when you see that, welcome to the club. This is still more or less okay, but indexes can get complicated, like this guy:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  store.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(&quot;GameEventCountZoneBySpecificCharacter&quot;,&#xA;                    new IndexDefinition&#xA;                    {&#xA;                        Map = @&quot;from doc in docs where doc.DataUploadId != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.RealmName != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.Region != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.CharacterName != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.Zone != null &#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.SubZone != null&#xA;    select new&#xA;    {&#xA;        DataUploadId = doc.DataUploadId,&#xA;        RealmName = doc.RealmName,&#xA;        Region = doc.Region,&#xA;        CharacterName = doc.CharacterName,&#xA;        Zone = doc.Zone,&#xA;        Count = 1&#xA;    };&quot;,&#xA;                        Reduce = @&quot;from result in results&#xA;        group result by new&#xA;        {&#xA;            DataUploadId = result.DataUploadId,&#xA;            RealmName = result.RealmName,&#xA;            Region = result.Region,&#xA;            CharacterName = result.CharacterName,&#xA;            Zone = result.Zone&#xA;        } into g&#xA;        select new&#xA;        {&#xA;            DataUploadId = g.Key.DataUploadId,&#xA;            RealmName = g.Key.RealmName,&#xA;            Region = g.Key.Region,&#xA;            CharacterName = g.Key.CharacterName,&#xA;            Zone = g.Key.Zone,&#xA;            Count = g.Sum(x =&gt; x.Count) &#xA;        };&quot;});&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I could tolerate the first example, I couldn&#x2019;t tolerate this one. I spent a lot of time exploring how I can get things setup so you&#x2019;ll be able to use linq (including all the usual strong typing goodies) on the client to define server indexes. The short answer is that a complete solution would take about a month of development. A workable solution can be used by serializing expression tree on the wire. But that would produce the following index definition on the server:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;That is not an acceptable option for me.&#xA;&#xA;But if we limit the scope to &#x201C;just get it working and accept that it won&#x2019;t handle 100% of the cases&#x201D;, the problem become much easier, and we can now do this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  documentStore.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(&quot;UsersByLocation&quot;,&#xA;    new IndexDefinition&lt;LinqIndexesFromClient.User&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = users =&gt; from user in users&#xA;                       select new { user.Region }&#xA;    });&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;And that would show up on the server as:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;It isn&#x2019;t the original expression, but it is clear enough, I think.&#xA;&#xA;What about that monster query? We can now write it like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  documentStore.DatabaseCommands.PutIndex(&quot;GameEventCountZoneBySpecificCharacter&quot;,&#xA;    new IndexDefinition&lt;Game.GameEvent, Game.GameEventCount&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = docs =&gt;&#xA;            from doc in docs&#xA;            where doc.DataUploadId != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.RealmName != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.Region != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.CharacterName != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.Zone != null&#xA;                &amp;&amp; doc.SubZone != null&#xA;            select new&#xA;            {&#xA;                doc.DataUploadId,&#xA;                doc.RealmName,&#xA;                doc.Region,&#xA;                doc.CharacterName,&#xA;                doc.Zone,&#xA;                Count = 1&#xA;            },&#xA;        Reduce = results =&gt; from result in results&#xA;                            group result by new&#xA;                            {&#xA;                                result.DataUploadId,&#xA;                                result.RealmName,&#xA;                                result.Region,&#xA;                                result.CharacterName,&#xA;                                result.Zone&#xA;                            }&#xA;                            into g&#xA;                            select new&#xA;                            {&#xA;                                g.Key.DataUploadId,&#xA;                                g.Key.RealmName,&#xA;                                g.Key.Region,&#xA;                                g.Key.CharacterName,&#xA;                                g.Key.Zone,&#xA;                                Count = g.Sum(x =&gt; x.Count)&#xA;                            }&#xA;    });&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Well, this will turn into this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;It isn&#x2019;t as nice as the original query, I&#x2019;ll admit, but it is still highly readable.&#xA;&#xA;And yes, it takes scary code to get there :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Column family databases are probably most known because of Google&#x2019;s BigTable implementation. The are very similar on the surface to relational database, but they are actually quite different beast. Some of the difference is storing data by rows (relational) vs. storing data by columns (column family databases). But a lot of the difference is conceptual in nature. You can&#x2019;t apply the same sort of solutions that you used in a relational form to a column database.  That is because column databases are not relational, for that matter, they don&#x2019;t even have what a RDBMS advocate would recognize as tables.     Nitpicker corner: this post is about the concept, I am going to ignore actual implementation details where they don&#x2019;t illustrate the actual concepts.      Note: If you want more information, I highly recommend this post, explaining about data modeling in a column database.   The following concepts are critical to understand how column databases work:     Column family     Super columns     Column    Columns and super columns in a column database are spare, meaning that they take exactly 0 bytes if they don&#x2019;t have a value in them. Column families are the nearest thing that we have for a table, since they are about the only thing that you need to define upfront. Unlike a table, however, the only thing that you define in a column family is the name and the key sort options (there is no schema).  Personally, I think that column family databases are probably the best proof of leaky abstractions. Just about everything in CFDB (as I&#x2019;ll call them from now on) is based around the idea of exposing the actual physical model to the users so they can make efficient use of that.     Column families &#x2013; A column family is how the data is stored on the disk. All the data in a single column family will sit in the same file (actually, set of files, but that is close enough). A column family can contain super columns or columns.     A super column is a dictionary, it is a column that contains other columns (but not other super columns).     A column is a tuple of name, value and timestamp (I&#x2019;ll ignore the timestamp and treat it as a key/value pair from now on).    It is important to understand that when schema design in a CFDB is of outmost importance, if you don&#x2019;t build your schema right, you literally can&#x2019;t get the data out. CFDB usually offer one of two forms of queries, by key or by key range. This make sense, since a CFDB is meant to be distributed, and the key determine where the actual physical data would be located. This is because the data is stored based on the sort order of the column family, and you have no real way of changing the sorting (except choosing between ascending or descending).  The sort order, unlike in a relational database, isn&#x2019;t affected by the columns values, but by the column names.  Let assume that in the Users column family, in the row &#x201C;@ayende&#x201D;, we have the column &#x201C;name&#x201D; set to &#x201C;Ayende Rahine&#x201D; and the column &#x201C;location&#x201D; set to &#x201C;Israel&#x201D;. The CFDB will physically sort them like this in the Users column family file:     @ayende/location = &#x201C;Israel&#x201D;&#xA;@ayende/name = &#x201C;Ayende Rahien&#x201D;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;This is because the sort &#x201C;location&#x201D; is lower than &#x201C;name&#x201D;. If we had a super column involved, for example, in the Friends column family, and the user &#x201C;@ayende&#x201D; had two friends, they would be physically stored like this in the Friends column family file:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  @ayende/friends/arava= 945&#xA;@ayende/friends/rose = 14&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Remember that, this property is quite important to understanding how things work in a CFDB. Let us imagine the twitter model, as our example. We need to store: users and tweets. We define three column families:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  Users &#x2013; sorted by UTF8 &#xA;&#xA;  Tweets &#x2013; sorted by Sequential Guid &#xA;&#xA;  UsersTweets &#x2013; super column family, sorted by Sequential Guid &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0; Let us create the user (a note about the notation: I am using named parameters to denote column&#x2019;s name &amp; value here. The key parameter is the row key, and the column family is Users):&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  cfdb.Users.Insert(key: &#x201C;@ayende&#x201D;, name: &#x201C;Ayende Rahine&#x201D;, location: &#x201C;Israel&#x201D;, profession: &#x201C;Wizard&#x201D;);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;You can see a visualization of how below. Note that this doesn&#x2019;t look at all like how we would typically visualize a row in a relational database.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; Now let us create a tweet:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  var firstTweetKey = &#x201C;Tweets/&#x201D; &#x2B; SequentialGuid.Create();&#xA;cfdb.Tweets.Insert(key: firstTweetKey, application: &#x201C;TweekDeck&#x201D;, text: &#x201C;Err, is this on?&#x201D;, private: true);&#xA;&#xA;var secondTweetKey = &#x201C;Tweets/&#x201D; &#x2B; SequentialGuid.Create();&#xA;cfdb.Tweets.Insert(key: secondTweetKey, app: &#x201C;Twhirl&#x201D;, version: &#x201C;1.2&#x201D;, text: &#x201C;Well, I guess this is my mandatory hello world&#x201D;, public: true);&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;And here is how it actually looks:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;There are several things to notice here:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  In this case, the key doesn&#x2019;t matter, but it does matter that it is sequential, because that will allow us to sort of it later. &#xA;&#xA;  Both rows have different data columns on them. &#xA;&#xA;  We don&#x2019;t actually have any way to associate a user to a tweet. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;That last bears some talking about. In a relational database, we would define a column called UserId, and that would give us the ability to link back to the user. Moreover, a relational will allow us to query the tweets by the user id, letting us get the user&#x2019;s tweets. A CFDB doesn&#x2019;t give us this option, there is no way to query by column value. For that matter, there is no way to query by column (which is a familiar trick if you are using something like Lucene).&#xA;&#xA;Instead, the only thing that a CFDB gives us is a query by key. In order to answer that question, we need the UsersTweets column family:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  cfdb.UsersTweets.Insert(key: &#x201C;@ayende&#x201D;,  timeline: { SequentialGuid.Create(): firstTweetKey } );&#xA;cfdb.UsersTweets.Insert(key: &#x201C;@ayende&#x201D;,  timeline: { SequentialGuid.Create(): secondTweetKey } ); &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;On the CFDB, it looks like this:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;And now we need more explanation about the notation. Here we insert into the UsersTweets column family, to the row with the key: &#x201C;@ayende&#x201D;, to the super column timeline two columns, the name of each column is a sequential guid, which means that we can sort by it. What this actually does is create a single row with a single super column, holding two columns, where each column name is a guid, and the value of each column is the key of a row in the Tweets table.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  Question: Couldn&#x2019;t we create a super column in the Users&#x2019; column family to store the relationship? Well, yes, we could, but a column family can contain either columns or super columns, it cannot contain both.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Now, in order to get tweets for a user, we need to execute:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  var tweetIds = &#xA;      cfdb.UsersTweets.Get(&#x201C;@ayende&#x201D;)             .Fetch(&#x201C;timeline&#x201D;)&#xA;             .Take(25)             .OrderByDescending()&#xA;             .Select(x=&gt;x.Value);&#xA;&#xA;var tweets = cfdb.Tweets.Get(tweetIds);&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;In essence, we execute two queries, one on the UsersTweets column family, requesting the columns &amp; values in the &#x201C;timeline&#x201D; super column in the row keyed &#x201C;@ayende&#x201D;, then execute another query against the Tweets column family to get the actual tweets.&#xA;&#xA;Because the data is sorted by the column name, and because we choose to sort in descending order, we get the last 25 tweets for this user. &#xA;&#xA;What would happen if I wanted to show the last 25 tweets overall (for the public timeline)? Well, that is actually very easy, all I need to do is to query the Tweets column family for tweets, ordering them by descending key order.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  Nitpicker corner: No, there is not such API for a CFDB for .NET that I know of, I made it up so it would be easier to discuss the topic.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Why is a CFDB so limiting?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;You might have noticed how many times I noted differences between RDBMS and a CFDB. I think that it is the CFDB that is the hardest to understand, since it is so close, on the surface to the relational model. But it seems to suffer from so many limitations. No joins, no real querying capability (except by primary key), nothing like the richness that we get from a relational database. Hell, Sqlite or Access gives me more than that. Why is it so limited?&#xA;&#xA;The answer is quite simple. A CFDB is designed to run on a large number of machines, and store huge amount of information. You literally cannot store that amount of data in a relational database, and even multi-machine relational databases, such as Oracle RAC will fall over and die very rapidly on the size of data and queries that a typical CFDB is handling easily.&#xA;&#xA;Do you remember that I noted that CFDB is really all about removing abstractions? CFDB is what happens when you take a database, strip everything away that make it hard to run in on a cluster and see what happens.&#xA;&#xA;The reason that CFDB don&#x2019;t provide joins is that joins require you to be able to scan the entire data set. That requires either someplace that has a view of the whole database (resulting in a bottleneck and a single point of failure) or actually executing a query over all machines in the cluster. Since that number can be pretty high, we want to avoid that.&#xA;&#xA;CFDB don&#x2019;t provide a way to query by column or value because that would necessitate either an index of the entire data set (or just in a single column family) which in again, not practical, or running the query on all machines, which is not possible. By limiting queries to just by key, CFDB ensure that they know exactly what node a query can run on. It means that each query is running on a small set of data, making them much cheaper.&#xA;&#xA;It requires a drastically different mode of thinking, and while I don&#x2019;t have practical experience with CFDB, I would imagine that migrations using them are&#x2026; unpleasant affairs, but they are one of the ways to get really high scalability out of your data storage.&#xA;&#xA;Waiting expectantly to the commenters who would say that relational databases are the BOMB and that I have no idea what I am talking about and that I should read Codd and that no one really need to use this sort of stuff except maybe Google and even then only because Google has no idea how RDBMS work (except maybe the team that worked on AdWords).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One question that I got a few times regarding Raven is why? Richard Lopes puts the question nicely:     However as a pragmatic developer, I am wondering what new this project is offering in a saturated market where you have quite mature alternatives like CouchDB, MongoDB, Tokyo, Redis, and many more ?     Many of these products are also cross platform and run at C speed with a proven record, being used in very big web sites where their sharding capabilities and fault tolerance have been pushed far.   The answer is composed of several parts, and cover quite a bit of history.  Why Raven DB from Ayende&#x2019;s point of view?     Almost two years ago, I decided that it is time that I give my Erlang reading abilities a big push and sat down and read Couch DB source code. That was quite interesting, and was one of the reasons that I got interested in that NoSQL Thing. Unfortunately, I am one of those people who have a really hard time learning by osmosis, I have to do something to truly understand it. I have used (and built) a distributed key value store in several projects, but I felt that I didn&#x2019;t really have a good understanding on what it means to use a document database.    I really hate having ideas stuck in my head, they tend to ping and then someone tell me that I have been staring at a blank wall for two hours, and I realize that I just finished designing a document database. And about a year ago, it finally got bad enough that I sat down and wrote an implementation, just to get it off my chest. That was Rhino DivanDB. In most ways, it was a proof of concept, more than anything else. Just enough so I could tell myself, yes, I can do it.     Then I run into situations where a document database would be an ideal fit, except&#x2026; that the available choices wouldn&#x2019;t quite do what I wanted. They are all open source, however, so no problem there, right? Except that none of them are really approachable to the .NET eco system. Yes, I can do both C&#x2B;&#x2B; and Erlang, but I don&#x2019;t really like it. Moreover, it seems like .NET support is almost an afterthought (if at all) for those projects.    There are some people who call me arrogant, but I really do think that I can do better. And I think that we did. Raven is a project where I tried a lot of new things, not from coding perspective, but from community &amp; launch perspectives. It will be out soon, and I think you&#x2019;ll be able to appreciate the level of focus on the non coding aspects of the project.   Why Raven DB from your point of view?     Raven is an OSS (with a commercial option) document database for the .NET/Windows platform. While there are other document databases around, such as CouchDB or MongoDB, there really isn&#x2019;t anything that a .NET developer can pick up and use without a significant amount of friction. Those projects are excellent in what they do, but they aren&#x2019;t targeting the .NET ecosystem.    Raven does, and in so doing, it brings a lot of benefits to the table. When building Raven and the supporting infrastructure, the focus was always on making sure that it did the Right Thing from the .NET developer point of view. Below you can see a more detailed analysis on Raven&#x2019;s benefits, but it comes down to that. Raven is build by .NET developers for .NET developers.     Corny, isn&#x2019;t it? But true nonetheless.   What does Raven DB has to offer? Raven&#x2026;     builds on existing infrastructure that is known to scale to amazing sizes (Raven&#x2019;s storage can handle up to 16 terrabytes on a single machine).    runs, natively and with no effort, on Windows. In comparison, to get CouchDB to run on Windows you start by compiling Erlang from source.    is not just a server. You can easily (trivially) embed Raven inside your application.    is transactional. That means ACID, if you put data in it, that data is going to stay there.     supports System.Transactions and can take part in distributed transactions.    allows you to define indexes using Linq queries.    supports map/reduce operations on top of your documents using Linq.    comes with a fully functional .NET client API, which implements Unit of Work, change tracking, read and write optimizations, and a bunch more.    has an amazing web interface allowing you to see, manipulate and query your documents.    is REST based, so you can access it via the java script API directly.    can be extended by writing MEF plugins.    has trigger support that allow you to do some really nifty things, like document merges, auditing, versioning and authorization.    supports partial document updates, so you don&#x2019;t have to send full documents over the wire.    supports sharding out of the box.    is available in both OSS and commercial modes.    There are probably other things, but I need to head out for a client now, so I&#x2019;ll stop.  I would love to hear your opinions about it, both positive and negative.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Paxos is an algorithm used to reach consensus among a group of machines, which is resilient to failures. For a long time, I had a really hard time understand Paxos. Or, to be rather more exact, I didn&#x2019;t have an issue with Paxos per-se, I understood the protocol. What I had a trouble with is its application.  My problem always was that I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what you do with it. That had to do with a basic problem on my part, I failed to understand how to go from a shared consensus on a numeric value to something that is actually useful. After a while, I had enough of feeling stupid, and I started reading all the material that I could on that, including going through the source codes of available Paxos implementations (such as libpaxos). The main problem was that I had a huge misconception in my head.  I kept thinking that Paxos is a consensus algorithm to arrive at a value in a distributed system. It isn&#x2019;t, and because I kept thinking that it is, I had a really hard time understand what it does and how to apply it.  Leslie Lamport [pdf], the original author of the algorithm, describe the goal of Paxos as follows:     Assume a collection of processes that can propose values. A consensus algorithm ensures that a single one among the proposed values is chosen. If no value is proposed, then no value should be chosen. If a value has been chosen, then processes should be able to learn the chosen value.   This is from the Paxos Made Simple paper, I don&#x2019;t know about you, but I have a hard time going from proposed value to something useful. What finally made everything click was the Paxos Made Code, which describe the implementation of libpaxos. While reading the paper, I had a light bulb moment.  Paxos is an algorithm used to ensure consist ordering semantics over a set of values in a cluster of machines. Why is this important? Because if you have consistent ordering over a set of values, and the values are events (or commands, or states), you can be sure that all machines in the cluster have either the same state or a previous version of the state.  Let us see how this can be useful. We have the following scenario:     Jane has no money in her back account.    Joe sends 100$ to Jane    When Jane is notified that it got the 100$, she send a 50$ check to the IRS    The IRS cash the check and spend it on something stupid.          Without a consistent ordering, each machine in the cluster may view the events in any order, which means that the following three timelines are allowed:     As you can imagine, Jane isn&#x2019;t very happy about that overdraft fee she was just charged with. It is important to note that Paxos sole use here is to ensure that all machines will have a consistent view of events across all machines. That view might not be the same as the order those events showed up. It is possible to give that guarantee as well, on top of Paxos, but that isn&#x2019;t the topic of this post.  Now that we all (hopefully) understand what Paxos is and what it is used for, let us talk about the algorithm itself.  Paxos has three actor types (Usually, the different actors are all part of the same system, either all together or two of the roles together), we will assume that we have 3 of each in our cluster and that we are interested in events ordered by sequential integer event ids with no gaps:     When you want to make a change in the system, you go to the proposer and tell it that you want to add event SendCheck { To= &#x201C;IRS&#x201D;, Amount = 50 } to the system.  The proposer then check what is the latest event id that it knows about, increment it, and then ask all the acceptors in the cluster to reserve that event id for its use. (Please note that I intentionally skip the details of how this is done, I am trying to get a high level description here, you can read the actual algorithm description for all the details).  There are several options here:     Another proposer is currently trying to reserve that event id.    Another proposer successfully claimed this event id.    Another proposer tried to claim this id and then crashed midway.    Etc&#x2026; :-)   What Paxos ensures is that in the end, even in the presence of failures of network and machines, the proposer will be able to write the SendCheck { To= &#x201C;IRS&#x201D;, Amount = 50 } to an event id in such a way that no other machine will see another value in that location and that eventually all machines in the cluster will see that value in that location.  It is important to understand that even with Paxos, the following timelines are possible:     That is, due to some error, we may not be fully up to date on some machines (as seen on machine #2) or that we have missing events (as seen on machine #3).  What Paxos provides is that there wouldn&#x2019;t be a scenario in which we have missing events and are not explicitly aware of that. At that point, we can defer processing of cashing the check until we know what event we are missing, explicitly decide to ignore the discontinuity in the time line or something else that fit the business needs.  In order to understand how this all works, I had to write my own implementation of Paxos in C#. There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be anything like that available to the public, and I (at least) find the code I wrote much easier to understand than libpaxos&#x2019; C or Erlang implementations. You can find the implementation here: http://github.com/ayende/Paxos.Demo</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is pure &#x201C;scratch an itch&#x201D; design post, since I started thinking about the topic, I might as well put my thoughts in a structured format. I am going to use twitter for this example, and assume that my end goal is to be able to do graph traversal, not just finding neighbors. Applying this to other social network scenarios should be pretty easy.  I generated this graph using this tool, this works using mentions, rather than following / followers graph, though. It will server to give you an idea what I am talking about.    One of the fundamentals of computer science is: localizing data leads to greater read performance. This is true whatever we are talking about keeping the data in the CPU L1 cache or in a distributed networked system. Typically, part of a sharding strategy is to keep all the data related to a root in a single location. The problem is, of course, that graphs don&#x2019;t really have roots. And in most social network graphs, there is no such thing as a closed graph. There are, on average, ~7 million users within three hops from any twitter user. Now, it would be very easy to put 7 millions users to a single machine, except, as they say, they aren&#x2019;t the same 7 million users.  Given that, I think that I can come up with an approach to allow more efficient queries and higher localization in the graph. The model assume an open and dynamic model (indeed, it relies on that).  We starts with geographical distribution. When we create a new user, we will place it in a shard dedicate to the geographical location the user is located on. This is a piece of data that we can get cheaply, and it has the advantage that users that interact with their circle of physical friends would tend to be clustered together anyway.   Next, we start assigning weights to associations. We only take into account outgoing associations (which solve the problem with outliers for incoming associations such as @aplsuk), but with a small twist, the weight of each outgoing association is taken as a portion of the total number of outgoing associations. In other words, the value of an outgoing association when you are following 10 friends is 0.1, but when you are following 500 friends, the value of each association is 0.002.  Next, we place some value on each mention that the user twits. A mention indicate that the association is active. For that matter, we probably need to create silent associations if a user keep mentioning someone that they are not following. For now, we will say that this value is 1% of the value of an association. That means that if I am following 100 users and I mentioned another user a hundred time, the value of the association is 0.02.  How does gravity comes into play here? Well, each outgoing association exact a pull on a node. But moving a node between shards is expensive, so we give shards an escape velocity. When we check if we need to re-shard a node, we aggregate the pulls of all the associations per node. Only if one shard pull is higher than the current shard pull &#x2B; escape velocity will the node be shifted to the new shard.  Over time, this will tend to migrate most users close to the users that they are actively associated with. With that in mind, we can now move of to queries.  As I mentioned, I am interested more in this for graph traversal, and the good thing about this approach is that for the most part, most of the relevant information is located on the same shard. When the times comes to perform a query, we can assert that queries, too, need to have an escape velocity to cross a shard boundary. Unless there are enough outgoing connections to a given shard to overcome the escape velocity, outgoing connections to that shard are ignored. We can limit the cost of remote calls further if we increase the escape velocity for the query as the query search deeper. In other words, the escape velocity at depth = 0 would be 10, at depth = 1 it would be 100, at depth = 2 it would be 1000, etc.  While this represent a loss in accuracy of the results, it also mean that for the most case, results will tend to be more relevant.   Is this important if I don&#x2019;t care for graph traversal?  There is another issue to consider, quite aside from graph traversal. The gravity approach outlined will tend to higher localization, and most operations are local. Consider writing a status update to all the people interested in that, when you have good locality, the cost of such on operation grows down drastically, in fact, I would say, it is highly likely that many such operations could be completed completely locally.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">During the course of this series, I got a lot of people declaring: &#x201C;But you can do that with RDMBS if you use XYZ&#x201D;. The problem inherit in this statement is that it ignore the fact that if you really want to, you can use a hammer to put screws, it isn&#x2019;t nice or efficient, but you can do it.  I run across this Dare Obasanjo&#x2019;s post that explains the actual problem in beautiful terms:     What tends to happen once you&#x2019;ve built a partitioned/sharded SQL database architecture is that you tend to notice that you&#x2019;ve given up most of the features of an ACID relational database. You give up the advantages of the relationships by eschewing foreign keys, triggers and joins since these are prohibitively expensive to run across multiple databases. Denormalizing the data means that you give up on Atomicity, Consistency and Isolation when updating or retrieving results. And the end all you have left is that your data is Durable (i.e. it is persistently stored) which isn&#x2019;t much better than you get from a dumb file system. Well, actually you also get to use SQL as your programming model which is nicer than performing direct file I/O operations.    It is unsurprising that after being at this point for years, some people in our industry have wondered whether it doesn&#x2019;t make more sense to use data stores that are optimized for the usage patterns of large scale websites instead of gloriously misusing relational databases.&#xA0; A good example of the tradeoffs is the blog post from the Digg team on why they switched to Cassandra. The database was already sharded which made performing joins to calculate results of queries such as &#x201C;which of my friends Dugg this item?&#x201D; to be infeasible. So instead they had to perform two reads from SQL (all Diggs on an item and all of the user&#x2019;s friends) then perform the intersection operation on the PHP front end code.   I can&#x2019;t use most of the relational database traditional advantages anyway. Not the moment that I step out of a single machine boundary. At that point, I have to re-evaluate what I am doing to see if it make sense to have to deal with the traditional relation database disadvantages. In many cases, the answer is no, and a solution that fit the problem better can be found.  This is where the NoSQL databases started. I think that once they gotten mature enough, they have advantages for smaller scale solutions, but that is a problem for another day.</p>
