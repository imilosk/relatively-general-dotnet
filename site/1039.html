            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I started this reposting of old stories, I didn&#x27;t think that it would take so long, or that I wrote so much.    I&#x27;m shocked to see how bad my English was (and I shudder to think what I would think about my English right now in ten years). And the stories aren&#x27;t really very good, but it&#x27;s good to remember them.    I&#x27;ll post the rest tomorrow, there are still ~10 of them, and they are the longest (and actually the most interesting).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">[Originally posted on as Barid Bel Medar @ 4 June, 1999 ]&#xA;[You probably need to read Tower of Midnight before you can understand this story.]&#xA;The very top of the Dragonmount held no air for a man to breath in the Waking &#xA;World. In Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod, it mattered nothing. &quot;What need do the dead &#xA;have in breathing?&quot; The man wondered loudly, he could, with a single thought, &#xA;stop breathing, call an end to the beating of his heart, and it would matter &#xA;nothing. &quot;How can the dead die again? Or live again?&quot; He shouted it to the wind, &#xA;gashing, cold wind that tried to pull him down, to make him fall from his high &#xA;stand. He laughed at the futile attempts. &quot;I stood before the Dark One in the &#xA;Pit of Doom, and in front Demandred and Moridin in the slopes of Shayol Ghul,&quot; &#xA;He told the wind, where no wind should be, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t stop me.&quot; &#xA;&quot;I didn&#x27;t think so,&quot; A female voice replied, &quot;It&#x27;s good to see you &#xA;again among us, Dragon.&quot; A woman appeared, young features despite long white &#xA;hair, she wore a green and yellow skirt, made of thin velvet. And she walked on &#xA;the air alone toward him. &#xA;The man snorted, &quot;It can hardly be good, being dead, Selizan.&quot; &#xA;&quot;You succeeded, so I understand, and it seemed to me that you&#x27;re &#xA;much... calmer than the last time you&#x27;ve appeared in the Unseen world.&quot; The &#xA;woman told him with a twisted grin. &#xA;&quot;Did I ever lose?&quot; The man asked, &quot;I search my memory, and as far &#xA;as I goes, I see not a single battle lost. From the beginning of time, all the &#xA;battles are won.&quot; &#xA;Selizan nodded, &quot;That is why you&#x27;re the Dragon, you know that. &#xA;There is no one else but you.&quot; &#xA;The man grimaced at her, &quot;There is no need in such things anymore, &#xA;you know that, how long before I will be called back for a new life? It would be &#xA;long for sure.&quot; &#xA;&quot;It&#x27;s always so, with you,&quot; The woman said, a chair appearing &#xA;behind her, &quot;You seemed to like the long rest.&quot; She added as she sat down. &#xA;&quot;Pawh! Long rest!&quot; The man nearly shout in disgust, &quot;Death, real &#xA;death, has to be more interesting than... this.&quot; His hand motioned forward, not &#xA;only the mountain, but this world, Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod was a prison for him &#xA;now.&#xA;&quot;Ancient and powerful and short temper as always,&quot; Selizan said, &#xA;&quot;But I&#x27;m not here to make that kind of a conversation with you, Rand al&#x27;Thor. It &#xA;had been half a year, in the waking world, since you died. And you stand here, &#xA;on your grave and birth place, thinking.&quot; &#xA;&quot;So they sent you,&quot; Rand smiled at the woman, she was his daughter &#xA;once, in an age long gone, a sister in another, sometimes a mother, most often, &#xA;their life were tied together. As he born, was she did, before or after, the &#xA;reverse, however, was untrue. &quot;You are no family this age.&quot; &#xA;&quot;For the time being,&quot; She agreed, &quot;That aiel wife of yours is &#xA;about to give birth, a matter of days, the last time I checked, maybe she &#xA;already did, the way time pass here.&quot; She glanced at him, he was one of the few &#xA;that knew how to control the passing of time in Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod. Few &#xA;understood how it was to be done, fewer were capable of doing it. &#xA;&quot;I see,&quot; His smile was nothing more than baring of teeth. &quot;And you &#xA;think that you might be born again, as my daughter, again?&quot; &#xA;She shrugged, &quot;We are tied together, Dragon. As you well know.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Tied?&quot; The man wondered, &quot;I remember killing you, is it the tie &#xA;you meant to?&quot; &#xA;She ignored his words, &quot;The rest would have like to welcome you, &#xA;but... consider the last time, they avoid you, until you&#x27;ll search for the &#xA;company.&quot; &#xA;&quot;I wish no company, Selizan.&quot; The man who was the dragon said, &quot;I &#xA;want my life back, the Light burn my soul!&quot; &#xA;Horror painted her face, &quot;You can&#x27;t!&quot; She whispered, swallowing &#xA;hard, &quot;you mustn&#x27;t! It will break every law, laws you have made!&quot; &#xA;He simply shrugged, &quot;Laws never hold me before,&quot; was all he said, &#xA;&quot;And you give me a reason for going that is strong enough for me to ignore the &#xA;laws.&quot; His eyes burned, scales appeared on his face, gold and scarlet, for a &#xA;long moment he simply stare at his hands, where five sharp claws replaced long, &#xA;delicate fingers. &quot;I will not let my children grow fatherless, nor let my &#xA;wives grief a man undead!&quot; &#xA;Selizan simply stared, &quot;Then go, there is none here that is &#xA;capable of stopping the Dragon. None will try, you know that. Remember duty, &#xA;Dragon, if you will try that, you might rip your tie to the Wheel of Time, never &#xA;to be reborn again, not the way we do.&quot; &#xA;He laughed, throwing his head back, &quot;There is nothing I hope more &#xA;than that, Selizan.&quot; He said, and jumped, his body changing as he thought himself &#xA;in another form. &#xA;Selizan stared at the cold red and black eyes of the creature, &#xA;snakelike, huge, shining in the sunlight of Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod, sharp teeth &#xA;were shown as the creature opened his mount, snakelike tongue, as wide as her &#xA;leg, tasted the air. Then he was gone. Selizan was gone a heartbeat after, they &#xA;would have to do something, to try to stop that, even though it would probably &#xA;be futile. It would take him hours, days, maybe weeks, to reach the point where &#xA;he could slip away from the world of dreams to the waking world safely. &#xA;The Dragon may not leave Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod. &#xA;&#xA;Egwene walked to the waygate with a fury she didn&#x27;t even try to control. &quot;I &#xA;still don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re so angry.&quot; Gawyn noted coldly on her side. &#xA;&quot;You want to get out of the White Tower, here is your chance, if only for a &#xA;short time.&quot; Sometimes Egwene wished she didn&#x27;t love the man so much, maybe then &#xA;she would be able to strangle him. &#xA;&quot;It&#x27;s not this, Gawyn.&quot; She said through clenched teeth. &quot;Whoever summoned &#xA;the Council better have a good reason for this. The Last Battle may be done &#xA;with. But there are thousands of details I need to take care for.&quot; &#xA;&quot;Stop this,&quot; Gawyn advised, as if he knew enough to do so, her husband or &#xA;not, Gawyn was Elayne&#x27;s brother, and an Asha&#x27;man beside. She trusted him, he &#xA;wouldn&#x27;t tell anything she ask him not to, but there were things she prefer he &#xA;wouldn&#x27;t know. Let Logain find it out by himself, if he could. &quot;Logain wouldn&#x27;t &#xA;let you gain more power than you already have. You should thank Leana and &#xA;Toveine for what you have.&quot; Egwene clenched her teeth harder, she didn&#x27;t like &#xA;hearing this. Only Gawyn knew her enough to make her so angry. And Rand, of &#xA;course, suddenly she had to blink tears from her eyes. The Council of Light was &#xA;Rand&#x27;s idea, Rand&#x27;s creation. Seven months since the Last Battle, since that &#xA;horrible battle when she was sure the Light had no chance at all. But despite &#xA;all, they had won, the price was horrible, but they won. More than three &#xA;millions dead, but the strategy the Council decided upon won the battle for &#xA;them. &#xA;The Shadow army was almost completely destroyed. But that wasn&#x27;t were the real &#xA;battle had taken place, of course, and not where the price was harder to pay. &#xA;Rand, Nynaeve and Lan, together with nearly hundred thousand soldiers, all of &#xA;them dead. In a suicide attack on Shayol Ghul. All dead, worse than dead. Their &#xA;souls taken by the Dark One, Egwene could only guess what the Dark One would do &#xA;to Rand. Even Halima wasn&#x27;t chatty about this particular subject. &#xA;As always, she hadn&#x27;t notice passing through the waygate, one moment she was &#xA;walking in one of the most unused corridors of the White Tower, the other she &#xA;was in the Hall of the Light. Nobody knew where this place was, save Rand and &#xA;maybe Logain and Halima and Elayne and Aviendha and none could travel here or from &#xA;here. White walls changed into stony one, a short corridor into the Hall. &quot;It&#x27;s &#xA;not this!&quot; Egwene said, &quot;I have to make sure that the rest of the Shadowspawn &#xA;will be destroyed, that the army will be dispersed properly, to make sure the Hall will listen &#xA;to me when I give them their bloody orders, even when they don&#x27;t understand it. &#xA;Thousand things to do, and I can do none when I called for useless chats.&quot; Halima was a part of the Council, and that was as much a reason as the other &#xA;one. &#xA;&quot;The army is for me to take care for.&quot; Gawyn said, he never lost his calm, &#xA;not since returning from the Black Tower. &quot;And you are angry because it&#x27;s not &#xA;Rand who summoned the Council. You&#x27;re afraid that someone else may want to take &#xA;his place. He was your friend, Egwene, there is no shame in grieving.&quot; The &#xA;Light alone know what he mean by this, she did grieve Rand, and Nynaeve, and all &#xA;the friends she lost. But she couldn&#x27;t afford herself to be weak now. &#xA;Now of all time the White Tower must be strong, to guide the world as it had &#xA;always done, and it wasn&#x27;t Rand who summoned the Council. Light, he couldn&#x27;t. He &#xA;is dead! Rand was the one thing uniting them. He created the Council, and the &#xA;Council won the Last Battle. But it was Rand that was holding them together, with an &#xA;iron fist indeed, but he held them together still. Egwene has no idea how sane &#xA;he was near the end. The orders he gave were mad enough, but mad or not, he had &#xA;won the last battle. Egwene knew she will &#xA;always have nightmares about Elayne&#x27;s face, and Aviendha&#x27;s and Min&#x27;s, seeing &#xA;that flash of light in the north, and knowing Rand was dead. &#xA;Gawyn held her shoulder tightly suddenly, she was just about to walk into a &#xA;wall. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Gawyn, I ... was thinking too hard.&quot; He snort in disbelief, &#xA;but loosened his grip. They had entered the Hall of Light, a pompous name, but &#xA;that was Rand&#x27;s intention. A fairly large room, with close to two dozens chairs, &#xA;arranged around black and white stone table. Gawyn left her to seat on her &#xA;chair, above her head the White Flame of Tar Valon shined clearly. Gawyn took &#xA;his chair on the opposite side of the table. His chair was carve with as a green &#xA;boar, with the Symbol of Light on the background. As the ancient sign of the Aes &#xA;Sedai was now called. They were the firsts to arrive, Egwene wished she could &#xA;cry, Rand was supposed to be here. As much as she hated him when he manipulated &#xA;her, giving her orders he made sure she would follow, with the results of &#xA;disobeying being explained to her in details. Rand wanted her to obey him, and &#xA;he cared nothing about what she thought. But despite everything, she would have &#xA;given close to everything just to have him again. She would even be happy to &#xA;hear him threatening on her. It was as ridiculous as it was true.&#xA;It hadn&#x27;t taken long before Logain entered the Hall. He was, as always, dressed all &#xA;in black silk, with two matching pins in each side of his collar, a dragon &#xA;wounding itself around a sword. He was walking the same way Gawyn did, as if he &#xA;would begin to dance or fight in the next step. The woman that followed him &#xA;looked as if she was created to please men. Dark hair surrounding oval face and green &#xA;eyes. Beautiful enough to make any man stare. She was dressed in the same &#xA;fashion as Logain, high collar black coat and breaches as black, two pins on her collar, a &#xA;sword and a dragon. The only female Asha&#x27;man. &#xA;It didn&#x27;t require thought, Egwene touched saidar and wove fire. Flame strong &#xA;enough to burn stone surrounded Halima. The woman stepped out of it, smiling! &#xA;The fire didn&#x27;t touch her. &quot;Egwene, how nice of you to give me such a... warm &#xA;welcome.&quot; She was ready for this, of course, Halima knew exactly how much she had hated &#xA;her. She had very good reasons. &#xA;&quot;Halima,&quot; Gawyn rose from his chair, smiling at the woman. Gawyn was her &#xA;warder for a long time now. And had she noted the slightest bit of attraction to the &#xA;woman she would have killed them both! But there was only affection in his voice, &#xA;in the bundle of his feelings in the back of her head! Affection! &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t tease Egwene so.&quot; Was she the only one that &#xA;wasn&#x27;t blind to the woman? She was one of the Forsaken! &#xA;There seemed to be true warmth in Halima&#x27;s smile, the woman had fooled her &#xA;for a long time. No longer, but now everyone else seemed to be fooled instead. &#xA;Light, Rand didn&#x27;t trust her, but he gave Halima his trust fully. Halima! &quot;One &#xA;more time, Egwene.&quot; Logain said pleasantly, &quot;and I will give you to Halima. I am &#xA;sure she could cure you from that bothersome hate to her.&quot; Halima smiled &#xA;faintly, hope &#xA;visible in her eyes. &#xA;&quot;Would you, Logain?&quot; Halima asked, her voice high with sudden hope. &quot;I can make &#xA;sure she will more... open to some suggestion you would make for her.&quot; Gawyn &#xA;growled something, his mouth moved, but she heard not a sound, a shield against &#xA;eavesdropping, from her! Halima looked at him and nodded slowly, Logain simply smiled. &#xA;&quot;As you say, Asha&#x27;man Gawyn.&quot; Halima said, &quot;But promise to tell me the next &#xA;time you two will have a fight, I can convince her not to be angry with you.&quot; &#xA;Egwene wished she could kill the woman, but Halima was stronger in the One Powerthan any woman &#xA;in the White Tower. And she guarded herself twice as much as any Asha&#x27;man near an Aes &#xA;Sedai. Egwene had already tried to convince Asha&#x27;mans to kill her, she tried &#xA;everything, from bribe to treats. Nothing convinced one of the black clad men to &#xA;do anything except mock her.&#xA;&quot;Why you summoned the meeting, Logain?&quot; She asked, maintaining a calm voice &#xA;and face was the hardest thing she did in her life. &#xA;&quot;I didn&#x27;t,&quot; the man replayed slowly, &quot;I thought you did. Where are the &#xA;others?&quot; He sounded as if he was telling the truth. So far, save twice, Rand was &#xA;the only one summoning those meeting. In those two times, everything seemed to &#xA;be ready to crush down on them, each time, it was Rand who saved them, barely.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;They will be here shortly, I assume. Wait,&quot; Gawyn said, as calm as a lake in &#xA;midwinter. He sat back in his chair, Logain and Halma took theirs. Halima was &#xA;marked&#xA0; with the a big cat&#x27;s face, with fangs shaped as the Dragon&#x27;s tooth, a &#xA;sign of evil since the Breaking. The sign for saidin, in the Age of Legends. For once, &#xA;Egwene agreed to the sign, it was Halima&#x27;s choice. A fitting once. Logain&#x27;s sign &#xA;was a dragon wounding itself around a silver sword, the same as his pin, only &#xA;the sign held the Symbol of Light in the background, it was the Black Tower&#x27;s &#xA;sign.&#xA;&#xA;None of them talked, there was nothing she had to say to Logain, and Gawyn &#xA;could all but read her mind. Halima, she would give only death or discomfort. Halima watched &#xA;the two men with open interest. For herself, Egwene leaned back in her chair, &#xA;staring at Gawyn. He had changed much since the day she had bonded him. Not just &#xA;Rand finding out that he had the spark, but in other ways also. He was an &#xA;Asha&#x27;man, with every meaning of the word. She pained every moment away from him &#xA;while he learned to use the power, feared with every breath that he might burn &#xA;himself out. Or kill himself during learning. He refused to go the Black Tower, &#xA;foolishly declaring that he can refuse to touch the True Source if he doesn&#x27;t &#xA;wish it. Rand had his way with him, as he seemed to have with everyone. Egwene &#xA;didn&#x27;t understand how the Asha&#x27;man arranged rank between themselves. All she &#xA;knew that it had nothing about strength in the power, or age. Gawyn held a high &#xA;position in the Black Tower, that was all Egwene knew. Gawyn refused to explain &#xA;it to her, saying only that it was a matter of the Black Tower and no the White. &#xA;Her eyes shifted to Logain, he leaned back in his chair, he had white in his &#xA;hair, Egwene heard Halima saying once that all he needed was to be little bit &#xA;taller and ten years older to look like Lews Therin&#x27;s brother. He ruled the &#xA;Black Tower ever since Taim... disappeared, not long after Rand and Nynaeve &#xA;cleaned the taint. Rand admitted killing Taim, so Elayne said, but nothing more &#xA;could be dragged out of the woman, nor from anyone else. The Black Tower held &#xA;its secrets well, nearly as well as the White Tower held its own secrets. All she knew was that more than one hundred Asha&#x27;mans had &#xA;disappeared after the Cleansing. It was something to wonder about, had Taim gone &#xA;mad, and the others? Or had Rand simply killed the man when he learned about &#xA;Logain? Either way, Rand trusted Logain, and like him. What couldn&#x27;t have been &#xA;said about Taim. &#xA;Halima made her angry simply by seating strait in her chair, toying with a &#xA;single golden bracelet. Her only other piece of jewelry was a thin golden &#xA;necklace with a emerald stone hanging down her throat. Her eyes were far off. &#xA;The woman had used the power on her, used it so she agreed to anything the woman &#xA;suggested. The second time she was a puppet. &#xA;She was one of the Forsakens, but Rand trusted her with his life. Rand, it &#xA;all centered around Rand, or so it seemed. With him dead, she would never &#xA;understand all his moves, there seemed to be no limit to the amount of things he &#xA;could handle at the same time. More than once, she thought everything was about &#xA;to crush, and every last time Rand had done something to save everything, often &#xA;it was more than risky, as often, it was pure luck that save them all. Twice &#xA;that she knew about Rand had showed cruelty that made even Halima disgusted.&#xA;&#xA;Egwene wasn&#x27;t sure how human Rand was at the end. He was swallowed entirely &#xA;in winning the Last Battle. But it was Halima she thought about, not Rand. In a &#xA;way, it was Logain who saved her, equally strong in saidin, the battle between &#xA;him and Halima could&#x27;ve ended with the death of either one of them, or both. She &#xA;still remember how she tried to protect the woman, when Logain traveled into her &#xA;study, while Halima played with her like a puppet. And she would make sure she &#xA;would pay, sooner or later. She savored on the memory of Halima&#x27;s face, &#xA;heartbeats after Logain threw himself on her, kissing her. She will carry to her &#xA;grave the memory of this. Asha&#x27;man bonded by a kiss, and a warder had to obey &#xA;her Asha&#x27;man. Halima accepted her defeat gracefully, Egwene admitted bitterly. &#xA;What she still hadn&#x27;t understood was why Rand hadn&#x27;t killed the woman. She knew &#xA;Logain had brought her to Rand. And she knew exactly how much Rand hated any of &#xA;the Forsaken. Egwene couldn&#x27;t even begin to understand what was happening &#xA;between Halima and Logain. The man had two other warders save Halima. Toviene &#xA;and Leane at least belonged to Light. Halima had sworn her soul to the Shadow. &#xA;Only the bond kept her loyal to Logain. How could such a woman be trusted was &#xA;beyond her. And why Rand allowed it was a mystery she didn&#x27;t even bother &#xA;thinking about. Rand did strange things more often than not. &#xA;The sound of soft steps was the only warning she had as Mat entered the Hall, &#xA;quieter than the night and twice as grim, he was clad in blood red and dark &#xA;green, the Band&#x27;s colors. A white hand on the left side of his breast. Tuon was &#xA;a step before him, her soft thread sounding loud next to Mat&#x27;s complete silence. Egwene smiled at &#xA;Mat, although inside she grieved for him as much as she did Rand. Mat&#x27;s eyes &#xA;never rested, even here, he constantly searched for danger. He was the closest &#xA;thing to a warder for Tuon as can be reached without the One Power. &#xA;&quot;Egwene,&quot; Tuon said, her voice icy. &quot;You were the one &#xA;summoning this meeting?&quot; Rand wanted peace in the world, and she wasn&#x27;t the only &#xA;one who felt the edge of Rand&#x27;s sword on her throat. Tuon didn&#x27;t like it one bit &#xA;more than Egwene herself did, but she had no more choice. Rand gave the world a &#xA;peace, The Peace Of The Sword. The Council was his way of reminding her, and &#xA;others, that they had to obey. Tuon probably hated being force to obey even more &#xA;than she did. &#xA;Mat simply nodded at her, he didn&#x27;t return her smile. He hardly smiled at &#xA;all, this days. The light of amusement in his eyes, as if he could always find a &#xA;funny side in everything had faded. Mat threatened to switch her the last time &#xA;she tried to question him about the problems he was neck deep in. She thought he &#xA;meant it. He was the only man in the world, save the Asha&#x27;man, that could make &#xA;this threat to her. She knew few things, she had only three eyes-and-ears in &#xA;Sendar, but what she knew was enough to grieve Mat. There was no love between &#xA;him and Tuon, why he had married the woman was a mystery to her. She thought him &#xA;wiser. &#xA;&quot;I didn&#x27;t; and Logain claim he hadn&#x27;t.&quot; She said, it wasn&#x27;t that she hated &#xA;Tuon, not exactly. But she couldn&#x27;t like the woman. Mat sat down on his chair, a &#xA;silver fox, with ravens on each of the fox&#x27;s shoulders. More than fitting to the &#xA;Empress&#x27; Hands, as he was known in Seanchan. She had only three eyes-and-ears in &#xA;Sendar, but it was more than enough to know how deeply Mat had changed. It &#xA;wasn&#x27;t only the lack of life in his eyes, Shen an Calhar was feared worst than &#xA;the Seekers in Seanchan. Close to fifty thousands soldiers, they had quelled &#xA;down three rebellions, facing odds of three to one at best. Mat had never lost a &#xA;battle. Rumors connected Mat to Tuon&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death. And to the deaths of the &#xA;leaders of the rebellions. Egwene had been forced to believe this, she had no &#xA;idea how Mat had done it, Seanchain nobles guarded themselves more than any &#xA;king, and for good reasons. But everyone opposing Tuon had simply died, usually &#xA;in their beds, their throats slit open wide, and every last time Mat wasn&#x27;t in &#xA;the Court of the Nine Moons when the murders took place. Tuon ruled well, but &#xA;Egwene wondered if she knew how much she owed to Mat. Being an Empress didn&#x27;t &#xA;make her invulnerable to knifes. Mat was the one who made sure that no noble in &#xA;Seanchan would even consider disobeying Tuon. Those who did died. &#xA;Tuon took her own chair, near Mat, a raven in dive, surrounded by nine &#xA;silver moons. &quot;Then who?&quot; Tuon demanded. &quot;I don&#x27;t like this place.&quot; Neither did &#xA;Egwene. &#xA;&quot;I suggest you would wait, Empress.&quot; Mat said, she had never heard him &#xA;calling Tuon anything but Empress. He turned to Gawyn, speaking in a voice too &#xA;low for her to hear without embracing the One Power. Logain rose from his chair and moved closer. The three men &#xA;speaking quietly, Logain rose his head once to glare at Tuon, before returning &#xA;his attention to the conversation. Tuon stared at her husband, she had a dagger &#xA;in her hands, she was toying with it. Egwene suspected that she wanted more than &#xA;toy with the dagger. Mat walked on the razor&#x27;s edge with Tuon. Halima was still &#xA;deep in her thoughts, Egwene would have given much to know what the woman was &#xA;thinking about. Something vile, no doubt. &#xA;The dagger disappeared from Tuon&#x27;s hands, she leaned back in her chair, and &#xA;closed her eyes. She seemed to be sleeping. It was a habit she had, she thought &#xA;better that way, so she claimed. She had let her hair grow, a violation of &#xA;Seanchain customs. Dark hair that reached her shoulders. That was the &#xA;only change in her since Mat married her. For reasons Egwene couldn&#x27;t &#xA;understand, he didn&#x27;t seem to love her. Nor she him, but he let her command him &#xA;in a way that made Egwene open her mouth in astonishment, no matter how many &#xA;times she had seen it. Not for the first time, she thought about asking Tuon how &#xA;she had done so. If only she wasn&#x27;t so arrogant..&#xA;&quot;Egwene,&quot; The voice behind her made her jump out of her chair, she gave Elayne a &#xA;strong, careful hug. Gawyn left Mat and Logain, and bowed to Elayne. &quot;Stop this, &#xA;Gawyn.&quot; Elayne berated him, only faintly smiling. &quot;We&#x27;re not in the Lion &#xA;Palace.&quot; Stepping back from Elayne, Egwene examined her. Elayne wore a green &#xA;dress, and her pregnancy was visible. Elayne looked &#xA;almost as she always did, glowing with health, yet her eyes were tinged with red. Egwene couldn&#x27;t imagine how it was like for her, &#xA;losing Rand. How Elayne could endure such a lose? Egwene&#x27;s heart cringed only &#xA;thinking about losing Gawyn. Helping his sister seat, Gawyn was half overjoyed &#xA;seeing Elayne. Half worried over her. Elayne chair&#x27;s, of course, was carved in &#xA;Andor&#x27;s Lion, white on red field. Birgitte hadn&#x27;t moved more than three steps &#xA;away from Elayne. She hadn&#x27;t since the day Rand died. Despite everything Elayne &#xA;had said to her, Birgitte couldn&#x27;t protect Elayne from what harmed her now. But &#xA;she could give some comfort. &#xA;Her chair, the one next to Elayne, was marked with a single silver arrow, on &#xA;dark green field. &quot;How are you?&quot; Gawyn asked, suddenly his face flushed, &quot;I meant...&quot; &#xA;Elayne touched his face fondly with one hand, &quot;It&#x27;s all right, Gawyn.&quot; But &#xA;her eyes were dark, Birgitte laid a comforting hand on her shoulder. &quot;I&#x27;ll be &#xA;fine.&quot; She will never be, Egwene knew. Sometimes Egwene thought that the only &#xA;thing that kept Elayne from dying was having Rand&#x27;s child. &quot;Aviendha will not &#xA;come, I fear. She is too busy taking care for Teadra.&quot; That was another thing to &#xA;wonder, Rand had married Elayne and Aviendha and Min. Why Elayne &#xA;agreed to this, &#xA;how could Elayne agree to this, was another thing that Egwene couldn&#x27;t understand. Their &#xA;seemed to be too much she hadn&#x27;t understood. She reminded herself to visit &#xA;Aviendha, Light, she was just too busy being an Amyrlin to visit her friends, &#xA;this would have to change. But above all that, she knew that Rand had made &#xA;Elayne more happy than she was ever was. And Aviendha and Min too. It was all &#xA;that she cared, in the end. &#xA;&quot;How is Aviendha? And Teadra?&quot; She asked, it was strange of Aviendha, giving &#xA;her daughter one Birgitte&#x27;s names. Or maybe it was Rand&#x27;s choice. Though he hadn&#x27;t &#xA;lived to see Teadra, of course. &#xA;&quot;Aviendha is sleeping,&quot; Birgitte replayed from her chair, she hadn&#x27;t looked &#xA;at her, her eyes were on Elayne, &quot;she needs to sleep. Teadra has a good lungs, &#xA;and she like to show them. The girl has to learn the meaning of the word &#xA;silence.&quot; But her smile was all too wide. She was as proud in Teadra as Aviendha &#xA;was. Elayne&#x27;s warder was just as protective and motherly with Min&#x27;s son, Rand &#xA;lived to see his son, at least. And Lezan was eight months old already.&#xA;&quot;Will Min come?&quot; Min parted her time between her son and her books, Egwene &#xA;had no idea what she loved more. Egwene hoped she would, too long since she had &#xA;seen her too. &#xA;Elayne laid a hand on her stomach, groaning and muttering something barely &#xA;audible. &quot;She will,&quot; She said, Elayne was impatient to have her own baby. To &#xA;stop the baby&#x27;s kicking as much as for any other reason, so she claimed. No one &#xA;believed her. &quot;She wanted to finish reading a page before she would come.&quot; Not &#xA;surprising, with Min. The woman loved books as much as she did Rand. &#xA;&quot;You have only a month more to bear, sister.&quot; Gawyn said cheerfully, &quot;I&#x27;m &#xA;sure it&#x27;s not that bad.&quot; Elayne&#x27;s glare slide right past him, &quot;Beside, I doubt &#xA;if there is any other way to have the baby.&quot; Halima laughed softly to this. &#xA;&quot;Wait until Egwene will have a baby, Gawyn. Then you will understand fully &#xA;how bad it&#x27;s. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to kill Osan&#x27;gar, maybe he could have planned a &#xA;more comfortable way.&quot; The dark woman said. Egwene stared at her sharply, she &#xA;couldn&#x27;t be implying that she was... No, it was simply impossible. &#xA;Elayne nodded to herself, staring at Logain&#x27;s warder, &quot;How long?&quot; Halima &#xA;became red, her eyes lying on Logain, she said nothing. &#xA;&quot;Did I missed something?&quot; Min&#x27;s voice was as throaty as always, but she &#xA;looked even sadder than Elayne was, which took something. &#xA;Halima sprang from her chair, she was the first to reach Min. For some &#xA;reason, Min liked Halima. Logain began to move also, but stopped as soon as Halima reached Min. &#xA;&quot;Oh, Light,&quot; Min breathed, &quot;I&#x27;m not that weak.&quot; A Trolloc&#x27;s spear in her side &#xA;nearly killed her, in the Last Battle, and she nearly died before she was &#xA;healed. It did nothing to stop Halima. Min&#x27;s chair was carved as a hawk with &#xA;fierce eyes, floating over white clouds. &#xA;Mat had watched with cold eyes, not even bothering to make a show of caring. &#xA;What happened to him, to change him so much? &quot;Only three more before we can &#xA;start,&quot; He said, &quot;When will Narishma and Mierin appear?&quot; They were in Shara, &#xA;ruling the country and the Silver Tower both. That was all she knew, the Gray &#xA;Asha&#x27;man never spoke to anyone unless spoken to, and nothing made them talk &#xA;about their homeland. &#xA;&quot;I talked with Mierin few hours ago,&quot; Halima said, no wonder, both women &#xA;belonged to the Shadow. Yet it seemed impossible to take down Mierin. Aes Sedai &#xA;weren&#x27;t allowed in Shara, and although the blues had more than few &#xA;eyes-and-ears in that distant land, the reports held more lies than truth. &quot;She &#xA;said they would come, but they might be late, there was an.. emergency there, &#xA;and Mierin seemed... eager to take care of that.&quot; What was the woman talking &#xA;about? &#xA;&quot;And that means?&quot; Gawyn asked, as always, making her feel that her mind was &#xA;entirely exposed to him. &#xA;Halima giggled! &quot;They were held back by a group of their children, they &#xA;shouldn&#x27;t have adopted so much of those who were born to the women who could &#xA;channel in Shara. The other Gray Asha&#x27;man could handle that.&quot; &#xA;&quot;With the warders they have?&quot; Logain inquired, &quot;They have too much troubles &#xA;keeping their throats whole to have time to take care for children. And the &#xA;Black Tower has taken as much as it could already.&quot; &#xA;&quot;Six thousands only, Logain.&quot; Halima replied, &quot;We can have twice as much &#xA;easily!&quot; &#xA;&quot;Argue later!&quot; The man stepped out of the shadows, as dark as the woman near &#xA;him was pale. Ilyena Sunhair, as she was once called, Nemesis, as she named &#xA;herself now. She wasn&#x27;t Valir&#x27;s warder, nor he was her, not as far as Egwene &#xA;knew. But the two rarely seen away from one another. &quot;Who summoned us?&quot; &#xA;&quot;I did,&quot; Mat replied. &#xA;&quot;Why hadn&#x27;t you told me this, Husband!&quot; Tuon hissed. &#xA;&quot;You never asked,&quot; His voice was cold as ice. &quot;All we&#x27;ve now to do is to wait &#xA;for Mierin to show up, only then I can give you the reason for this summon.&quot; &#xA;Gawyn touched her hand, &quot;Hold on, dear. There will be here shortly.&quot; &#xA;Egwene sniffed at him arrogantly, &quot;I do hope so!&quot; &#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&quot;When you were named Jaem Giant-Slayer I fought by your side, as we slay &#xA;the Giant Mosk.&quot; The woman stood in front of him, her hair, and her temper, &#xA;resembled very much a hot flame. &quot;When the Dark One broke free of his prison I &#xA;fought by your side, Lews Therin! I fought the Trolloc Wars, seen my land die &#xA;and die with my country! I am as committed to this as you are, Dragon! &#xA;And I will not allow you to do what you&#x27;re planning.&quot; &#xA;&quot;My name is Rand al&#x27;Thor,&quot; He said softly, coldly, the softness of a blade &#xA;drawn, the coldness of a fresh grave. &quot;What is the name you use, this days? &#xA;Alsbet, the Queen of All, who battled the Giant Mosk. Or should I name you &#xA;Telidar Therin Mirlil, and call you sister? Or do you go by the name Eldrene ay Ellan&#xA;ay Carlan, and still grief lost Manetheren? Be the name you go by as it &#xA;may be, you can&#x27;t stop me.&quot; &#xA;&quot;No,&quot; The man by her side agreed, &quot;None of us can, not by ourselves, Dragon. &#xA;You can best the best, here, and in the waking world, to whom you will not &#xA;return. You may not return. The law is clear. A law you have forged yourself! &#xA;You are the dragon, you cannot allow yourself take the risk!&quot; &#xA;&quot;Indeed, Hawkwings.&quot; Rand agreed, his eyes far off, how long ago he created &#xA;this law. &quot;But there are times where not even I can abide the law. Sometimes, &#xA;the price is too heavy.&quot; Arthur began to open his mouth, but Rand raise a hand &#xA;tiredly. &quot;Can you truly tell me that I do not deserve it? When did I last lived &#xA;a life without storms of battle and winds of war? When wasn&#x27;t I directed by duty &#xA;and honor and the Dark One&#x27;s defeat? Don&#x27;t I, too, deserve to live a life free &#xA;of &#xA;war, life where I will not have to guard my back, or fear for those who I dear? &#xA;Don&#x27;t I have the right for it? Haven&#x27;t I paid enough to have it? Tell me that I &#xA;do not deserve it, Artur Hawkwing. Tell me, and I will remain here. Say it loud &#xA;and clear, so I know your words for true! Say it, if you can!&quot; &#xA;&quot;You have earned that right more than any of us here, Dragon. &#xA;Thousand fold &#xA;more than any of us ever had, but you still may not go. Duty bind you, Dragon. &#xA;And you must disregarded it, not once in all of your life times.&quot; The woman &#xA;fell silent, everything in her showed that she was sure she had won the &#xA;argument. &#xA;&quot;Then maybe it&#x27;s time for me to begin,&quot; Rand said coldly, &quot;There are times, &#xA;sister. When even duty empty itself of all content. Enough is enough, I&#x27;ve given &#xA;enough of myself, long enough, to do as I please.&quot; &#xA;&quot;A lovely speech, Lews Therin.&quot; Another man shimmered near them, rumors flied &#xA;fast, here as elsewhere. &quot;I just wonder who you&#x27;re trying to convince. Her or &#xA;yourself.&quot; &#xA;&#xA;&quot;Why did you summon the council?&quot; Gawyn asked, neither Logain nor Halima &#xA;seemed even slightly surprised. Mat produced three balls of nowhere and began &#xA;juggling them in the air, leaning back in his chair. &quot;I will tell you when Mierin &#xA;show up.&quot; &#xA;Elayne drew herself up, &quot;I don&#x27;t have the time to wait, Matrim Cauthon!&quot; &#xA;&quot;You do,&quot; Halima said calmly, &quot;The baby wouldn&#x27;t be born for at least a &#xA;month, I can promise you that.&quot; &#xA;Elayne gave a start, her hand touching her stomach before her eyes turned &#xA;into cold storm. &quot;What have you done to me?&quot; &#xA;Halima stared at her for a moment, &quot;I did nothing, I simply checked how is &#xA;the baby. Do you want to know the gender?&quot; &#xA;&quot;The gender?&quot; Elayne stared at the dark woman in shocked surprise. Then she &#xA;shocked her head, &quot;No, I think I better not. I would like to be surprised.&quot; &#xA;Halima shrugged, &quot;As you wish, although I doubt that you&#x27;ll enjoy the... &#xA;surprise.&quot; &#xA;Logain threw his head back and laughed, ignoring the hard glares Halima and &#xA;Elayne gave him. There was nothing funny in Halima&#x27;s words. &#xA;&quot;They are coming,&quot; Gawyn said quietly. Egwene heard them &#xA;too, anyone could hear them, they argued in voices loud enough to be heard on &#xA;Tar Valon! The subject, however, was unclear. Someone about a boy or a man named Seleamon was all she managed to hear before they fell silent. Narishma eyes, as &#xA;always, seemed to penetrate into the back of her skull, reading her mind. &#xA;Mierin, as well, looked just as she always did. Cold and cool, with blue eyes &#xA;that revealed nothing and her hair falling back, the silvery hair making &#xA;stunning contrast against the black she constantly wore now. &#xA;&quot;Now they are here,&quot; Egwene said sharply to Mat, not letting the couple that &#xA;came in to say a word. &quot;Why are we here?&quot; &#xA;&quot;Very simple,&quot; Mat replied, then waited for Narishma and Mierin to seat down. &#xA;Mierin was smiling haughtily at her direction. Narishma frowning. Mierin&#x27;s chair &#xA;had a white stars that made the from of a hawk. Narishma&#x27;s chair was decorated &#xA;with a gray tower on the background of the ancient symbol of Aes Sedai. &quot;I&#x27;ve my &#xA;orders. And they were... very strict.&quot; &#xA;&quot;Orders, husband?&quot; Tuon said with a placid voice, &quot;Who can give you orders, &#xA;save me?&quot; The last two words weren&#x27;t said aloud, yet they hand in the air &#xA;nevertheless. &#xA;&quot;Rand al&#x27;Thor.&quot; Mat answered without a moment of hesitation. Elayne gasped. Logain tensed, &#xA;but Halima relaxed, she &#xA;nodded to herself, half smiling, as if this was just the thing she expected. Toun kept her face calm. The others, hope and fear, &#xA;mingled together. In her as &#xA;well in others. Mat opened his mouth again, and repeated his words, deepening &#xA;the shock, &quot;My orders came from Rand al&#x27;Thor, the Dragon bloody Reborn.&quot; He &#xA;sound as if he hardly believed his own words, &quot;A man dead for more than half a &#xA;year.&quot; &#xA;Yes, it ends here, incomplete. Sorry about that</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">No creature of the Blight entered deep cave in the Mountains of Dhoom. No &#xA;Shadowspawn would have dared. Not even a direct command from one of the Chosen, &#xA;or from the Great Lord of Dark itself would have convinced any to go down to the &#xA;depth of that cave. The Chosen themselves wouldn&#x27;t have entered that cave unless &#xA;ordered by the Great Lord. For what lied in there was deadly in potential even &#xA;to them. Yet, despite the danger, now one invaded the cave, walking down a rocky &#xA;path into endless darkness. &#xA;A mydraal, clad in the dead black all fades wore, stepping with a &#xA;ball of darkness lightening its way in silver light. Taller than any Myrdraal, &#xA;Shaidar Haran stepped down into the forbidden cave in the Blight. A secret long &#xA;forgotten, the chosen knew its secret, as well as the Great Lord himself, and &#xA;now Shaidar Haran as well. None other knew about this place, and the dragon must &#xA;never learn. The myrdraal reached the end of the tunnel, he stepped lightly, the &#xA;place was dangerous, very much dangerous, especially for the like of him. &#xA;The slivery light shined over metallic scales in gold and red, and &#xA;the Hand of Dark took a step back. For the first time in his life, Shaidar Haran &#xA;felt fear. The creature was fifty feet long, and at least five feet thick. The &#xA;head lied over the body, it was easily as big as Shaidar Haran&#x27;s body, capable &#xA;of swallowing him in one snatch. The creature lied asleep, a snake the size of a &#xA;small house. Sharp teeth could be seen through half open mouth, fully open, it &#xA;would be taller than Shaidar Haran by three feet. &#xA;A fearsome creature, even to the Hand of the Dark. More fearsome &#xA;for it was no shadowspawn, nor any creature of the dark. &#xA;A dragon, the most deadliest creature on earth, only THE dragon &#xA;could control the creature. &#xA;The dragon created them, only twelve, and only this one survived &#xA;the War of Power, even after three thousands years, Shaidar Haran felt the &#xA;creature breathing in its sleep. Like a strong wind, he stared down at his &#xA;cloak, troubled, no wind could move his cloak, nor the strongest storm on earth, &#xA;but his cloak, to the breath of this creature, moved. &#xA;A night black sword appeared in his hand, and he put it an inch &#xA;from the Dragon&#x27;s eye, there could be not much of armor here, the closed eyelid &#xA;couldn&#x27;t protect the eye from a sword sharper than any razor, and then his sword &#xA;would find the brain, quick death for the last of the dragons. &#xA;But he sheathed his sword with an inaudible sigh, he had his &#xA;orders. And he wouldn&#x27;t disobey a direct command from the Great Lord, yet. And &#xA;he was warned that countless thousands died in order to try harming the last &#xA;dragon, none even awaked the creature. &#xA;He turned his back to the creature, and walked away. &#xA;There would be no trouble from this direction, he dared hope, the &#xA;dragon slept, may the Great Lord gaurd its dreams through out eternity. Shaidar &#xA;Haran felt strength in the creature, the same as he felt when he watched the &#xA;Dragon Reborn, the ancient enemy of his master. &#xA;It meant nothing, it would sleep until the end of time, or die in &#xA;its sleep, if they had any luck. &#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;Deep in the cave in the Mountains of Doom, a dragon woke, stretching limbs &#xA;unused for over two thousands years. He had waken to the Trolloc wars, a &#xA;wonderful time for the like of the dragon. There was much food then. Now, he had &#xA;been awoken again, and the reason was still unknown to it. &#xA;It was a beautiful sight, seeing the Dragon moving, a snake-like &#xA;creature moving on four strong feet, claws bigger than a man&#x27;s arm, sharper than &#xA;daggers. Slowly, he exit the cave that was its home for so long, all it took was &#xA;one swing of that huge tail, twelve feet long, covered with armed scales, and &#xA;the entrance collapsed. It smelled the air, a scent reached its nose, the sweet &#xA;odor of a Trolloc and the even sweeter of a Myrdraal. It hadn&#x27;t feast for &#xA;thousands of years, it was hungry. VERY hungry. &#xA;It began to run, following the smell, ready to hunt. &#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;The dragon lift its head from its twenty seventh Trolloc, growling at the &#xA;skies. a piece of myrdraal&#x27;s cloth still hung to his mouth, it was ripped apart &#xA;with one motion of it&#x27;s left front leg. The call was being heard again, the &#xA;sound that awoke it. &#xA;The sound it made could be describe only as a song. A dragon &#xA;answering to the call he was being bred to answer to the call. It began to ran, &#xA;faster than any horse, it would keep this rate until it would reach its master. &#xA;Lews Therin Telamon, Rand al&#x27;Thor, as they named him in this age. &#xA;The lord of the dragons!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">What would have happened if... Rand and Sammael killed &#xA;each other in Shadar Logoth &#xA;The flows needed to balefire gathered themselves almost without &#xA;Rand being aware of it. And he was ready to weave it when he saw flows of saidin &#xA;reaching for the figure in front of the gateway. The image of the Forsaken &#xA;dissipated in the air. An illusion, he searched for the source of those weaves &#xA;as he felt a gateway being woven. &#xA;Throwing himself forward he draw his sword and whirled to face Sammael, the &#xA;Forsaken steeped through the gateway, a once handsome man but now with a scar &#xA;that lingered from hairline to jaw. Rand remembered the day he gave Sammael that &#xA;scar when on Rorn M&#x27;doi. The man carried a sword black as &#xA;midnight, Sammael was the one who forged it, with the aid thirty-one dreadlords &#xA;and thirty-two Myradraals. It was said that this sword destroyed the souls of &#xA;those it killed and knowing Sammael Rand didn&#x27;t dare to doubt it. Shadar, that &#xA;was how it was called, The Shadow in the old tongue. Sammael was full with the &#xA;One Power, he held only a bit less then Rand himself did. But only Ishmael ever &#xA;managed to match him.&#xA;&quot;I never thought you could lay your hand on that again. There should have been &#xA;something good in the breaking.&quot; Shadar moved like a serpent tongue, searching &#xA;for blood. At the same time Sammael waved Spirit and Fire in order to sever the &#xA;shield Rand created. Rand didn&#x27;t bother with mentioning it, and answered the &#xA;Parting of Silk with the Sparrow Rising. Fire and Air and &#xA;Spirit completed the attack, and Sammael jumped back to avoid the screen of fire &#xA;that shot from the floor. &#xA;&quot;You will never know what you might find in a Stasis Box, Lews Therin. Come, it &#xA;is time to die.&quot; Sammael snarled at him. The Moon over Water met the &#xA;Tumbling Stone, and Rand block half a dozen weaves that meant to destroy him.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;This time you will not escape, Tel Janin, as you did in Rorn M&#x27;doi and in Nol &#xA;Caimaine and Suhadra. This time you will meet justice.&quot; He started to press on, &#xA;thirteen weaves were his limit, and he was pushing it. This time he broke the &#xA;floor under Sammael&#x27;s feet, and called lightings to strike the man. Sammael &#xA;weave Air to block the lightnings and Fire and Air to make a bridge. Rand&#x27;s &#xA;sword left a red trail over Sammael&#x27;s left sleeve. The Forsaken couldn&#x27;t block &#xA;the Wind over the Wall, as he should have. But the Forsaken did managed to &#xA;kick Rand&#x27;s left foot, so the blade cut his arm and not his chest. &#xA;This kind of game they played hadn&#x27;t shown on the world for more then three &#xA;Thousands years, swords and blades and limbs and the One Power joined together &#xA;to create a deadly dance. They were both experts in that method of battle, &#xA;Sammael from the War of Power and Rand from his memories of the same War. &#xA;They moved now on a platform, nothing left from the tower, a bridge woven from &#xA;Air and Fire, Rand wasn&#x27;t sure which one of them created it. He sent weaves and &#xA;invert the flows that hold them in the air, now Sammael couldn&#x27;t see the &#xA;platform they where standing on. He would have to feel his way through or he &#xA;might fall over the edge. In a moment another bridge appeared and inverted. &#xA;Sammael created a bridge for himself. Rand&#x27;s side ached, even within the void, a &#xA;scratch on his face bled, where Shadar found a hole in his defense. He couldn&#x27;t &#xA;tell for his life how long they where fighting. &#xA;&quot;So you do have some skills, Lews Therin.&quot; Sammael said as he moved back from &#xA;him, now there was forced respect in his voice. &quot;Do you care for this&#x2026; Elayne, &#xA;Lews Therin? A girl that looks so much like the wife you murdered surely would &#xA;be an interest for you? Do you mean to slay her too, Kinslayer? Or do you think &#xA;giving her Andor would some how make up for you? For what you have done?&quot; Rand &#xA;staggered back, his sword moved to block Sammael&#x27;s attacks but his heart wasn&#x27;t &#xA;in it. The Forsaken&#x27;s words hurt him more then any wound could ever be. &quot;Are you &#xA;still so softhearted that you will be sorry for her death, Lews Therin? Are you, &#xA;Rand al&#x27;Thor?&quot; If he hoped to weaken Rand again he was mistaken, a cold light &#xA;burned in his eyes, and his only answer was the quickening speed Rand moved his &#xA;sword. &#xA;&quot;She is probably already dead anyway. There are still Gholams in this age; &#xA;someone had kept one inside a stasis box. And I sent it after her; her &#xA;channeling would do nothing to help her against it. If you like to have her, I&#x27;m &#xA;certain that I can manage do it; you want a leg or an arm? Maybe the whole head?&quot; &#xA;Sammael&#x27;s voice was dry, and the ordinary tone he had used only made his words &#xA;more horrible. &#xA;If there was a Gholam out there, and if he was really after Elayne&#x2026; now Rand &#xA;gave up defending at all, sword and limbs joined together to busy Sammael as he &#xA;waved a sword from all Five Powers. He sent it to Sammael, with all the power he &#xA;could master, enough to level all Shadar Logoth, enough to create mountains and &#xA;move oceans. Now it was Sammael who draw back, eyes widening in fear, he knew what &#xA;this weave could do to him. He severed the weave, but Rand waved another, and &#xA;another. Each of them severed, but now Sammael had to use all the amount of &#xA;saidin he could master to defend himself. Rand&#x27;s sword found&#xA0; again and again; another red trail joined the one on Sammael&#x27;s sleeve. And &#xA;then another, just beneath his eye. &#xA;&quot;Burn you, Lews Therin.&quot; He shouted at Rand as another weave severed, the &#xA;Forsaken couldn&#x27;t fight with the One Power and with the sword together, at least &#xA;not while he had to defend himself from a weave that was more than deadly to him &#xA;but meaningless to Rand. Then he tried to attack Rand, with both sword and the &#xA;One Power. Rand didn&#x27;t even bother to split his weaves, falling on the his back &#xA;to escape from the balefire the Forsaken weave he didn&#x27;t stop to reweave his own &#xA;weapon, Sammael gave too much power to the balefire and Rand&#x27;s weave reached its &#xA;target. &#xA;The Forsaken screamed; a scream full of agony and pain, for a moment there &#xA;seemed to be two of him, as the bond to his lord had been severed. Two images of &#xA;Sammael, moving away from each other but after a heartbeat they joined together. &#xA;The Forsaken&#x27;s sword fell, and he seemed to be on the brink of falling to his &#xA;knees. His eyes looked&#x2026; lost. Saidin left him slowly. &#xA;Rand scrambled to his feet, fear nearly break through the void, if he was wrong &#xA;about the black wires he would have been dead. Sammael stared at him, beaten, &#xA;but this Forsaken wouldn&#x27;t find Asmodean&#x27;s fate. His sword found its way to the &#xA;man&#x27;s rib, sinking through the flesh to Sammael&#x27;s hearth, if he still had one.&#xA;&#xA;Sammael stare at the blade in his chest, &quot;If I will die, Lews Therin, I will &#xA;take you with me.&quot; He whispered. saidin returned to him, a raging flood that &#xA;was more than Sammael could handle even if he wasn&#x27;t dying. Rand moved back when &#xA;he understood what the Forsaken was doing, too late he tried to shield the man. &#xA;Tried to shield himself from what he knew was coming, but he was&#xA0; too late. His &#xA;last thought was sorrow that he would be able to tell Elayne and Aviendha that &#xA;he loves them. &#xA;Sammael exploded; fire hot enough to burn stone to cinders shot in all &#xA;directions, burning every thing in its path. Rand&#x27;s body burn immediately, the&#xA;saidin he held added to the destruction as white hot lightning &#xA;connected the earth and the sky again, as it did more then three thousands years &#xA;ago. &#xA;A valley was now expanding, a valley big enough to be call an sea, a river that &#xA;once passed few riding hours from the city now poured into the new valley, &#xA;promising that there would be a sea where once Shadar Logoth stand. &#xA;From the city nothing left, the fire burned anything it touched, purifying the &#xA;thing it touched. Noting left of the tainted city. Mashadar itself manage &#xA;somehow to survive the fire, but had give up as the lightning came at him, &#xA;burning the creature that needed the night&#x27;s darkness to protect it. &#xA;For two thousands years there had been a city there, those who knew its name &#xA;feared it, and those who traveled in it never returned untouched. Now there was &#xA;new hope for the place, burned by fire and purified by lightning, the place so &#xA;many years tainted was clean. &#xA;On Cairhien, Allanna screamed as the bond between her and Rand &#xA;was gone. The grief she only now managed to control came back ten times as &#xA;strong. She wasn&#x27;t aware of Amys helping her to seat. &quot;What happened to you, Aes &#xA;Sedai?&quot; Sorilea asked in a firm voice. The Wise Ones might be scornful for Aes &#xA;Sedai but they knew better then to think that an Aes Sedai start screaming for &#xA;no reason. &#xA;&quot;Rand, he is dead.&quot; Allanna answered, Sorilea voice affected her as if she had &#xA;been thrown into cold water. She knew what she had to do now, that was the very &#xA;least she could do for Rand. She rose to her feet and went out of the tent. &#xA;Blinking away tears she knew she would shed for many nights she walked to the &#xA;city, she had to meet Min. Somehow she knew that Rand would want her to tell his &#xA;lover personally that he was&#x2026;. &#xA;The only chance of humanity had gone, she ignored the Wise Ones shouts behind &#xA;her, she had something to do first. &#xA;Rand stood on what was once Shadar Logoth, staring at the sea that &#xA;was filling beneath him, he was dead. &#x27;Burn me if I am not dead,&#x27; he thought &#xA;grimly, memories seemed to come back to him. As if they were always there but he &#xA;had never noticed them before. Memories of old battles welled up in him. Women he &#xA;loved, rules he made but never cared to obey. Memories, lives, &#xA;love. All that came on him, like a wave that almost crushed him. &#xA;He knew where he was, now. And the world of dreams shifted around him, first &#xA;things were first, but after he would meet some old friends, he had no intention &#xA;in the world of staying dead, no intention at all. &#xA;Elayne watched Egwene sadly as the woman departed Tel&#x2019;aran&#x2019;rhiod; &#xA;the sense that they were being watched was stronger this night. And Elayne &#xA;didn&#x2019;t like staying here alone. She wished she could see Rand, wished she could &#xA;find out where Mat bloody Cauthon was hiding. Well, there were things that &#xA;weren&#x2019;t possible even here. She already sent Birgitte to see what she could find &#xA;in the city about Mat. And the only way for her to see Rand was in her dreams, &#xA;at least until she would find out how to make the Bowl of the Winds work. &#xA;She left the dream. Tried to, anyway, nothing happened. Aghast, she tried to &#xA;leave Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod again, and again, nothing changed. Moghedien she thought, &#xA;The World of Dream was a place Moghedien knew of more than anyone else. And &#xA;Elayne knew very well that she had no chance facing the Forsaken even if this &#xA;would come to fighting with saidar. And she had no chance either in trying to &#xA;leash the woman. Desperately she tried to reach for saidar, and was so stunned &#xA;on succeeding that she lost her grip in the True Source. &#xA;&quot;Why under the light would Moghedien force me to stay in the world of dreams but &#xA;won&#x2019;t shield me?&quot; She murmured, Moghedien wasn&#x2019;t one to take chances. &#xA;&quot;Sometimes Aes Sedai are so smart that they are quite foolish.&quot; Said Rand from &#xA;behind her. That familiar voice she dreamed hearing almost every night gave her &#xA;a start, and she whirled backward so fast that she stumbled on her own feet. &#xA;Rand was just&#x2026; there, catching her; she didn&#x27;t see him crossing the space &#xA;between them. &#xA;&quot;How did you came here, Rand?&quot; She asked a moment latter, when she managed to &#xA;take her hands off him, &#x201C;You came here in the flesh, didn&#x2019;t you? Nynaeve told &#xA;you that this is dangerous, haven&#x2019;t she?&#x201D; disappointingly Rand stepped away from &#xA;her, and from all the things in the world he looked amused! &#xA;&quot;You might say that I&#x2019;m here in the flesh, Elayne. But you can&#x2019;t say I have a &#xA;choice.&quot; He stopped for a moment and observed her closely. &quot;I&#x2019;m dead.&quot; &#xA;Fear nearly overcame her, it took great effort to keep her face straight; if he &#xA;was going mad already&#x2026; but then a new thought came to her. Birgitte had been &#xA;dead also, but she lived here. She was a hero, of course, but so was Rand, in a &#xA;way. It was hard to be in grief for someone that stood in front of her. She &#xA;opened her mouth but Rand foretold her, &quot;You know what happened to Birgitte, &#xA;don&#x2019;t you? She somehow managed to survive what Moghedien did to her. Arthur said &#xA;that she had been here after Moghedien&#x2026; chased her away.&quot; &#xA;Her eyes bulged, how could he know this&#x2026; Arthur, Arthur Hawkwings! This is going &#xA;too weird for me, she thought. &#xA;&quot;How did you do this, Elayne? I can do anything Moghedien did, and I know how to &#xA;do this, but this only mean that I will kill myself, and there would be no &#xA;Tel&#x2019;aran&#x2019;rhiod after that death.&#x201D; &#xA;Elayne took a deep breath and started talking, telling him everything that &#xA;happened to her and Nynaeve since Tear. He listened to her carefully, sometimes &#xA;asking her a question or two. When she finished he looked more amused than &#xA;anything else. &quot;It will not suffice for me, not one.&quot; He said finally. &#xA;&quot;What are you talking about, Rand. If it worked for Birgitte it will work for &#xA;you too.&quot; &#xA;&quot;I&#x2019;m not a woman, if you hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&quot; He answered irritably, &quot;Haven&#x2019;t you &#xA;noticed that the bond between you and Birgitte is stronger than the normal.&quot; He &#xA;must have seen something is her face because he didn&#x2019;t even let her open her &#xA;mouth. &quot;And yes, here I can be a woman.&quot; His body flickered for a moment, a &#xA;woman stood in front of her, a female copy of Rand, then he return to his body, &#xA;without slowing the torrent, though he did looked pale, &quot;So you can forget about &#xA;this.&quot; Elayne almost grinned, the thought only crossed her and she didn&#x2019;t like &#xA;the idea of Rand returning as a woman anymore than he apparently did. &#xA;&quot;What would happen if I would link with Aviendha and then bond you? Will this be &#xA;suffice to keep you alive?&quot; The words coming out of her mouth gave her a start, &#xA;she didn&#x2019;t want to share Rand anymore than she had to, and she want Rand&#x2019;s bond &#xA;at least all to herself. If her word surprised her they had stunned Rand, &quot;I&#x2026; &#xA;think that this should work. It would be on the edge but it should work. But we &#xA;must do today, now if you can do it will be more than good.&quot; &#xA;&quot;Why?&quot;&#x201D; she asked him, of course she meant to do it as quickly as. Did he think &#xA;she wanted to see him continue to be dead? &#xA;&quot;There are things we mustn&#x2019;t do, I wrote the prohibitions, and obey them, for &#xA;long time. It&#x2019;s hard to break such habits.&quot; &#xA;They talked for a few more moments, nothing important and then she closed her &#xA;eyes and exited the dream, she had to wake Aviendha. Rand said he would give her &#xA;half an hour before he will try to duplicate what Moghedien did to Birgitte. &#xA;As quickly as she could she woke Aviendha staffed her into her cloths while &#xA;trying to dress herself and explaining the Aielwoman, what happened seemed &#xA;impossible. But in a half an hour they were ready, and when Rand appeared, &#xA;seemingly from the air and nearly fell on Aviendha they managed to bond him. &#xA;Elayne felt the bond being established, felt the weakness that was the result of &#xA;what he had done. But unlike Birgitte he didn&#x2019;t woke after an hour or so, and &#xA;the weakness didn&#x2019;t fade or if it did, not my any degree Elayne could feel. All &#xA;they could do was to seat and wait, Healing did no good for such illness. And &#xA;they sat; each woman cloud in her own cloud of fears and doubts. Till the first &#xA;light of dawn shown through the windows. Then Rand made the first sound and &#xA;tried to sit up, Aviendha was there before he could hurt himself, Elayne didn&#x2019;t &#xA;understood how the Aielwoman wasn&#x2019;t as sleepy as she herself was. They stayed &#xA;most of the night near Rand&#x2019;s bed, worrying. Rand eyes flickered, and he opened &#xA;them, blue-gray eyes stare at clearly, winningly. &quot;So I actually made it.&quot; He &#xA;said, his hand moved toward his side searching something. Only now Elayne &#xA;understood that the old wound he received on Falme wasn&#x2019;t there anymore. What &#xA;more Rand fixed in Tel&#x2019;aran&#x2019;rhiod, where you could such things easily? She &#xA;wondered. &#xA;Egwene sat on that shaky chair that was still the best in the &#xA;camp. She stared at the reports on the desk that was as shaky as the chair. &#xA;Stared at them and for a moment she hoped that she was mad, thinking that this &#xA;was only her personal madness was much better than what those reports said. The &#xA;Black Tower was gone, all the Asha&#x2019;man just disappeared. But almost a thousands &#xA;men couldn&#x2019;t just disappear in the air, especially when all could channel. No &#xA;one knew where they had gone, or why. &#xA;Reports form Cairhien insisted that Rand died, most of the Aiels seemed think &#xA;so, but another report form Illian said that Rand was crowned as king there. &#xA;Rand was conferring with the rulers of the borderlands, five different Aes Sedai &#xA;tried to eavesdrop to the same conversation heard five different talks. From one &#xA;that insisted that a Myradraal appeared and everybody in the room, including &#xA;Rand; received orders from it. To another sister that claimed she heard them &#xA;talking about the best way to hunt a boar. &#xA;Perrin was in Gehealdan, if Suian&#x2019;s eyes and ears were worth something, but he was &#xA;escorted by two Aes Sedai that were sent to Rand, and they obeyed him! What he was &#xA;doing there no one managed to find out.&#xA;She raised her head slowly when Suian stormed in smiling, &#x201C;The Blight are &#xA;burning, Mother. From the blasted land to the borderlands&#x2019; borders, and all the &#xA;way from the Aiel waste to the Ocean.&#x201D; &#xA;Before Egwene had time to answer her another Aes Sedai rushed in, Egwene didn&#x2019;t &#xA;remember her name. But she was one of the sisters that tried to convince the &#xA;borderlands to support her. &#xA;&quot;The Borderlands had declared for the al&#x2019;Thor. He burned the Blight as a&#x2026; a&#x2026; &#xA;payment.&quot; She sounded shocked, and Egwene could understand her easily, if Rand &#xA;could order his men to burn the entire blight they were in deep trouble. &#xA;And as if she hadn&#x2019;t enough troubles Leana entered the tent, no doubt carrying &#xA;more urgent news that would need her immediate care. But the woman looked as if &#xA;she had been stilled again. &#xA;&quot;The Asha&#x2019;man&#x2026; they&#x2026; Rand had conquered Tar Valon. I had reports that say that&#x2026;&quot; &#xA;Leana suddenly stopped, &quot;Maybe it will be best if you will see for yourself.&quot; &#xA;Egwene stared at the report Leana gave her, all the sisters were at the &#xA;dungeons, and Elaida and the hall were stilled and sent to farming! The banner &#xA;of Light fly over the White Tower, and Asha&#x2019;man was all over the Tower. The &#xA;writer was apparently a servant in the Tower, and she mentioned that none save &#xA;Aes Sedai and warders had taken any hurt. Not that somebody was fool enough to &#xA;try to stand in the way of a man that could channel. She reached the last &#xA;paragraph of the letter and cursed without sounding a voice, someone was fool &#xA;enough. A warder challenged one of the Asha&#x2019;man. The Asha&#x2019;man killed him with &#xA;bare hands. By the report the Warder was given a sword and the reporter doubted &#xA;if the Asha&#x2019;man used saidin. &#xA;Egwene lied the letter down carefully, &quot;Leana, summon the hall, Suian go find me &#xA;Sheriam. You,&quot; she pointed at the Aes Sedai she didn&#x2019;t knew, &quot;come with me.&quot; She &#xA;steeped out of the tent, all but running. Gawyn was in the White Tower and she &#xA;worried about him, he could be easily foolish enough to try challenging an &#xA;Asha&#x2019;man himself if she wouldn&#x2019;t be there to keep an eye on him. But she pushed &#xA;thoughts of Gawyn from her head, she could do nothing if the hall wouldn&#x2019;t &#xA;permit her to go. &#x201C;The light burn that fool law to ashes.&#x201D; She muttered, the &#xA;hall must let her go! &#xA;She had to see Rand, to hear from him what under the light he was doing!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">What would have happened if... in the Fires of Heaven Aviendha would &#xA;have taken Rand into the Land of the Madmen instead of Seanchan. &#xA;Rand tried to listen to Aviendha&#x27;s heart, but its beating came slower and &#xA;slower. She was dying and there was nothing he could do about it, he would have &#xA;been overjoyed to see Moiraine popping out of the air to heal Aviendha, he would &#xA;be even glad of Semirhage. But he didn&#x27;t know how to heal. And Aviendha was &#xA;dying, unless&#x2026; Bits and pieces of things he had just heard about came to him, he &#xA;didn&#x27;t know this either but he could have guessed, using all the power he could &#xA;master he wove Spirit. One of the most complex weaves he had ever woven, he had &#xA;only little knowledge about what might happen if he would succeed, but suddenly &#xA;he could feel Aviendha. Feel his body and her&#x27;s; it was supposed to help her, &#xA;though he had no idea if anyone had tried this before on women. The warder bond &#xA;he had created should give her the power to survive wounds that would kill any &#xA;other, he just hoped that it would work on her too. Prayed that she wouldn&#x27;t die &#xA;from freezing, of course, if she would survive he probably wouldn&#x27;t. &#xA;She had made that gateway to run from him, he had no idea what she &#xA;would do when she would find out that she was tied to him. He put his ear on her &#xA;chest again, searching for heartbeats, he thought they were a bit stronger, only &#xA;a bit. But he could feel her weakness, feel what she felt though she was &#xA;unconsciousness. And she was ice in his arms, through the small knot of emotions &#xA;and senses in the back of his head he could sense her weakness. Trying to cut &#xA;his line of thoughts, he really didn&#x27;t want to think of what might happen to &#xA;Aviendha, and trying to stop himself thinking that he had a woman with no cloths &#xA;on against his body, he started talking. He talked about the first thing that &#xA;came to his mind, Elayne and her letters, unfortunately the thoughts of kissing &#xA;Elayne in the Stone also came with it. The last thing he needed now was to think &#xA;about kissing, he tried to talk about Min for a while. He had no idea what he &#xA;felt for her, no more than he had about what he felt toward Aviendha and Elayne, &#xA;but he liked her. &#xA;Don&#x27;t think about women, you fool. He thought furiously, the void &#xA;trembled and he barely managed to avoid being destroyed by saidin. Rand&#x27;s &#xA;hand started stroking Aviendha&#x27;s hair, glimpsing damply on the dim light of the &#xA;flames he wove before. She was warm, he noticed suddenly, very warm. He should &#xA;move away from her, but he had as much chance to fly as to force his body away &#xA;from her. Her eyes opened, clear green eyes staring at his without even a touch &#xA;of the anger that was so often there when she looked at him, he started moving &#xA;away from her and she caught his hairs in painful grip. He couldn&#x27;t move away &#xA;without leaving a bald patch on his head. &quot;I promised my near. sister that I &#xA;would watch you for.&quot; She seemed to be talking more to herself than to him, in &#xA;almost expressionless voice. &quot;But the rings do not lie, and I can run no more.&quot; &#xA;Her voice firmed noticeably. &quot;I will run no more!&quot; She clutched his head with &#xA;both hands and pulled his mouth to her. The void was gone and saidin fled &#xA;from him as she kissed him, it was certainly strange to feel the kiss as she did &#xA;it, strange but certainly pleasant. The last logic thought he had was that he &#xA;could stop neither her nor himself.&#xA;&#xA;Rand watched Aviendha while they walked toward the gateway she created. &#xA;Saidin filled him and he channeled fire to melt them a path. He glanced back &#xA;at the snow hut, some part of him hoped that he could have just stayed forever &#xA;with Aviendha there. The small knot of emotions in the back of his head, &#xA;Aviendha, told him nothing he could understand. Not that he expect anything, if &#xA;he couldn&#x27;t sort out his own feeling why should he expect that he could sort out &#xA;Aviendha&#x27;s. The warder bond worked both ways, and now Rand started having a very &#xA;uncomfortable feeling. Aviendha was more than good in reading his mind before he &#xA;bonded her, to save her life, now she probably be able to know what he would &#xA;think. After they&#x2026; he raked a hand through his hair and tried to push the memory &#xA;away, only half succeeding. She nearly took his head off when she found out that &#xA;he had bonded her, he thought he could find a way to move the bond to someone &#xA;else, if not to break it completely. He only half understood what he was doing &#xA;when he bonded her. But he could only move the bond to a man that could channel; &#xA;the only choice she had save him would be Asmodean. So she would stay bonded to &#xA;him, surprisingly it wasn&#x27;t the bond itself that seemed to worry her, but that &#xA;she now had a part of him that Elayne didn&#x27;t owned. He had more chance to &#xA;understand how to escape the taint on saidin than to understand Aviendha; or any &#xA;other women at all. If he only had half from what Mat knew... He had just enough &#xA;time to throw himself at Aviendha, walking angrily at his side and muttering &#xA;about frozen water and her current opinion about the car&#x27;a&#x27;carn. And not &#xA;those he would have liked to hear from her, before a ball of fire as big as a &#xA;horse or two passed right where their heads were before. &#xA;At the same time he had woven flows of Fire and Earth, no time to be gentle &#xA;or sophisticated, just simple weaves that would make the Forsaken that had &#xA;attacked them sorry he hadn&#x27;t stayed hidden. It had to be one of the Forsaken, &#xA;the ball of fire had been made by saidin. Though he did expect something &#xA;more from Sammael, only Sammael would attacked him so, Demendred was too careful &#xA;to challenge him if he thought he had the slightest chance to loose or had other &#xA;choice. He thought that lesson to the Forsaken on Parran Disen. And Asmodean was &#xA;too weak to risk such simple attack. The source of saidin faded, it could &#xA;mean that the man had released saidin but Rand&#xA0; hoped that this &#xA;meant that Sammael was dead. It had to be Sammael, no one else would have &#xA;done it, he thought grimly as he helped Aviendha to rise. &#xA;&quot;What do you&#x2026;&quot; she started as soon as she was on her feet, the glare she gave &#xA;him could have melt the snow by itself, without needing saidar, and then &#xA;she saw the tree that the fire had burned on its way to them and swallowed hard. &#xA;&quot;Thank you.&quot; She murmured finally. But he barely heard, he could see the gateway &#xA;she had created, but he didn&#x27;t walk that way, he had to make sure that the &#xA;Forsaken was dead. He hurried to the place he had felt saidin being &#xA;woven, with Aviendha not a step behind. Of course, now it was nothing more than &#xA;a big hole in the ground. &quot;No!&quot; he whispered when he saw the broken body that &#xA;was lying there, it wasn&#x27;t Sammael or anyone of the Forsaken. &quot;No!&quot; &#xA;A young man only little older from himself; with dark hair and eyes staring &#xA;at the sun without blinking. He had never seen the man but knew more about him &#xA;than he ever wanted to know. Men who can touch the male half of the True Source &#xA;are becoming mad and then they are starting to rot, creating horror with the One &#xA;Power. That was what stories told, that was the fate expected for him. A path &#xA;that the man he had just killed had already met, the eyes were whole but almost &#xA;everything else in the face had already given up to the rotting, he could see &#xA;white bone through blood red gushes in the face and the hands. He heard &#xA;Aviendha&#x27;s gasp behind him, and didn&#x27;t blame her at all. Without the void he &#xA;probably would&#x27;ve thrown up.&#xA;He didn&#x27;t regret killing the man, this was probably the best &#xA;service he could have given the men, &quot;At least it would explain why I thought &#xA;the earth was shaking, half explain.&quot; He realized that he had said it aloud only &#xA;when Aviendha grunted and glared. His face felt on fire, even inside the void. &#xA;He turned away from the man, there was nothing he could do for him or himself.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Rand,&quot; surprisingly, Aviendha hesitated, a thing she never done &#xA;before. But there was fear inside her now, he could feel it as much as he could &#xA;feel his own. If he would go mad&#x2026; there was a reason for the title kinslayer. &#xA;&quot;You could do nothing.&quot; Aviendha continued. He turned his face to her, not &#xA;stopping trotting, but his glare just slide from her. &quot;I know, Aviendha. The &#xA;light help me, that much I know.&quot; The words was bitter, if he would go mad&#x2026; he &#xA;didn&#x27;t want to think what he might do. If he would manage to lay a hand on &#xA;callandor or worse, the male ter&#x27;angreal he had kept on Rhuidean&#x2026; he &#xA;didn&#x27;t needed to complete the thought. There would be no world after that. And &#xA;the fury that babbled inside him was for that he was helpless as a baby against &#xA;the madness as much as it was for the Dark One for tainting saidin. &#xA;On the Age of Legends they had tried to clean saidin, that &#xA;he knew, and right then he didn&#x27;t care how he knew this. Of the three trying one &#xA;had created the Spine of the World and the second the Mountains of Dhoom. Three &#xA;times the Aes Sedai on the Age of Legends tried to clean the taint from the male &#xA;half of the True Source. Three? And only two failed? What in the name of the &#xA;light was the third? He thought as he understood what he was thinking, he could &#xA;already see the gateway, Aviendha followed him with worried glances, did she &#xA;thought he might go mad right now? His laugh made her jump, and she laid a hand &#xA;on his shoulder, &#xA;&quot;Rand al&#x27;Thor,&quot; she started, and then gasped when the gateway she &#xA;made closed. The tingle, that told him she was holding saidar, faded for &#xA;the first time since she saw the man, she would have been sagging to her knees &#xA;hadn&#x27;t he was holding her. He carried her through his own gateway, into utter &#xA;blackness, he had cut the weave that was holding her gateway open. They weren&#x27;t &#xA;going back just yet, the platform started moving as soon as he was on it. He &#xA;laid Aviendha on the platform, making her as comfortable as he could, and sat on &#xA;the floor. His destination was the Blight, and even skimming took time. &#xA;&#xA;Aviendha could stand by her own when Rand opened another hole in the &#xA;blackness that surrounded them. The shock she felt when she saw that their only &#xA;way home had gone was too much for her, going on the top of what happened last &#xA;night between them. Not to mention the bond between them, she could feel Rand, &#xA;and that was both pleasing and shaming. He belonged to Elayne, but Aviendha &#xA;wanted him for herself. Ji&#x27;e&#x27;toh left her one choice though, and she &#xA;never even considered breaking it. She followed Rand into the Blight; what could &#xA;Rand want in the Blight she had no idea, Rand just ignored her questions. Rand &#xA;stopped in front of a tree she didn&#x27;t recognize, one that hadn&#x27;t given up to the &#xA;corruption of the blight. The tree had the look of one that had been here for a &#xA;long time. Rand laid a hand on it, murmuring something that sound like a prayer. &#xA;In the back of her head there was sadness and grief.&#xA;&#xA0;&quot;What is so sad about this tree, Rand al&#x27;Thor?&quot; she asked sharply, she &#xA;had enough not knowing so much. &quot;It&#x27;s the grave of the Green Man, Aviendha. &#xA;Somatsa was a friend of mine.&quot; Her breath caught, &quot;So this is the Eye of the &#xA;World, but what you&#x27;re seeking here, what is it?&quot; The look he gave her was so &#xA;innocent she almost believed he came here to visit the grave of the Green Man, &#xA;&quot;I can feel this, Rand al&#x27;Thor. What. Are. You. Seeking. Here.&quot; She was loosing &#xA;the hold on her temper, but right now she didn&#x27;t care. She had more than enough &#xA;reasons to be angry. Now she could see a building, on the arched door there was &#xA;a symbol half white and half black, divided by sinuous line. The ancient symbol &#xA;of the Aes Sedai in the Age of Legends. &#xA;Rand entered the building without even slowing, for herself; Aviendha allowed &#xA;herself to scan the building Rand entered to for a heartbeat before she entered &#xA;inside it. You couldn&#x27;t be too careful in the Blight. When she finally came &#xA;inside, Rand was seating on the floor, holding a small green stone, his angreal, &#xA;there was sweat on his face, and she felt the taint inside him. &quot;This was once a &#xA;place where a part of saidin was kept,&quot; he sounded as if he was talking &#xA;to himself more to her, she didn&#x27;t care, she needed answers. &quot;One hundred men &#xA;and women created this place, they had somehow learned how to clean saidin but &#xA;they hadn&#x27;t the power to clean it all. They kept the part they manage to clean, &#xA;I destroyed the Eye the first time I came here. You asked what I&#x27;m seeking &#xA;Aviendha, isn&#x27;t it? I&#x27;m seeking the way they had found, and believe me I will &#xA;find it.&quot; &#xA;And use it even if it will kill you too, thought Aviendha. Egwene &#xA;told her what happened in the Eye when she and Nynaeve and Rand and Moiraine &#xA;came here. But whatever weave were used here to clean saidin was over &#xA;three thousand years old. There was no hope for Rand in his search here. &quot;Saidin&#xA;and saidar turn the Wheel of Time.&quot; Now there was more beads of swear &#xA;on his face and he breathed too quickly, &quot;I have a&#x2026; trick, you may call it so, &#xA;sometime you can see what happened in the past.&quot; As if his words were a sign, a &#xA;mist began to form itself from nothing, creating the image of men and women &#xA;standing, she needn&#x27;t need to count to know that there were a hundred of them. &#xA;&quot;Going that much back is... difficult.&quot; The light of saidar surrounded &#xA;the women while the men were surrounded by a blackness that somehow didn&#x27;t stop &#xA;her from seeing through it. She saw the weave they used, or only half of it, the &#xA;half that were made by saidar. Rand was watching them closely, and &#xA;Aviendha copied him. It was interesting, if Rand could find a way to clean &#xA;saidin, if he could escape the madness and the&#x2026; the picture of the young man &#xA;Rand killed would hunt her many night. The mist image was gone, and Rand was on &#xA;his feet, another hole in the air open behind him as he offered her a hand to &#xA;help her rise. &quot;Where are we going now?&quot; She asked. Rand&#x27;s smile sent a ball of &#xA;ice into her stomach, those men and women died trying to clean a small part of &#xA;saidin, what was Rand planning to do? &quot;To Rhuidean, of course, to clean &#xA;saidin.&quot;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">What would have happened if&#x2026; in Lord of Chaos, a few days after Taim&#x27;s arrival Aviendha would have found out that she was pregnant.&#xA;Rand entered his rooms in Andor on tiptoes, he thought that it must be already midnight. And for once he hoped that he would come when Aviendha was already sleeping, he tried to avoid her as much as he could now. The dangers he must face before the Last Battle shouldn&#x27;t be shared with her, he had seen her dying once, on the very day he had killed Rahvin and avenged Elayne&#x27;s mother. There were few things he was sure about them completely, but one of them was that any woman he kept too close to him was in danger. If he learned anything from Lanfear it was this lesson, and it wasn&#x27;t one he could easily forget.&#xA;He glanced at the pallet were Aviendha should have been, even if she wasn&#x27;t sleeping she should have been there, waiting for him. The woman had a great deal of fun taunting him, sometimes he thought that she did this just because he blushed. He frowned when he noticed that Aviendha wasn&#x27;t on her pallet. She had nowhere to go in this time of the night, and that left the possibilities of a shadowspawn or one of the Forsakens, if she was dead; or kidnapped by Semirhage or Greandel or any one of the other that was still alive. Even Asmodean if the man had the nerves to come in here when he was that much weaken because of Lanfear&#x27;s shield; which wasn&#x2019;t very likely. But he had seen Aviendha dead once, and he doubted if there was a thing he wouldn&#x27;t do to stop her from dying again, this time there might be no balefire to alter the weave of the pattern, and if Aviendha died&#x2026; He would die too.&#xA;Before he even began thinking he reached for saidin, all the sweetness of life and corruption of the taint; caused by his own actions. He filled himself with the power till he thought he would burn from the amount that was in him, till he was full with a river of molten ice and a lake of frozen fire. With saidin in him he could sense every stir of the air against his skin, see the world so clearly that life without the power was unthinkable. He could hear Aviendha breathing, she was in the room he used as a throne room, he must have gone past her by without noticing.&#xA;Rand turned and went to her, no matter how hard he told himself that this is a mistake. He only meant to take a look at her, to see that she was fine. Those fears were ridiculous; of course, Aviendha could take care of herself very well. But he couldn&#x27;t stop for his life, he feared for her any moment she wasn&#x27;t in his sight. And every moment he had her in front of him he had to fight himself as much as he fought saidin, he wanted her even though he knew he couldn&#x27;t have her. Even when he knew that he was a danger to her, it didn&#x27;t matter how often he told himself that he had to stay away from her, he just couldn&#x27;t do it. His grin held no mirth, if he couldn&#x27;t make himself send Aviendha away when every shred of logic told him he must send her away from him, what was the chances that he could hold the madness off. He raked a hand through his hair; he really didn&#x27;t want to think about this. For a moment he wasn&#x27;t sure whatever he meant, madness or Aviendha.&#xA;His eyes stopped on Aviendha, sitting on the floor in nearly white blouse and dark skirt. Light but she was beautiful, he thought. His eyes bulged when he understood why she was so quite when he passed her by few moments ago. She was drunk! Aviendha! That was unthinkable, she rarely drunk something stronger than wine. What under the light could have made her drink so much? He hurried to her and kneeled beside her, taking her head in his hands he channeled briefly. Simple weaves of Spirit and Fire and Water, the weave came from Lews Therin&#x27;s memories, for once he was grateful that memories passed along the borders between him and Lews Therin. He never thought of asking Asmodean how to suppress the affect of too much drinking. &#xA;    &#xA;    Aviendha gasped as if thrown into roaring fire and jerked right out of his hands. The drunkenness seemed to slide out of her when she stood on unsteady feet, he hold her hand. To help her stand he told himself, it had nothing to do with that she felt so good, nothing at all. She didn&#x27;t try to free herself and she didn&#x27;t walk away, what he expected her to do, instead she just looked at him. Clear blue-green eyes staring at him not a foot away, there was something in her eyes, a redness that he first ignored that he now recognized as signs of crying. That was even more stunning than anything he had seen this day, he could have accepted Aviendha drunk, but Aviendha crying! That was more than unbelievable, more than impossible. &#xA;    &#xA;    &quot;What happened, Aviendha?&quot; He asked her softly, gently. He doubted if something else would help him, in fact he very much doubted if anything would help him at all. But instead of telling him what happened to her that was enough to make her drink so much and cry; or even telling him that this was none of his business as he more than half expected, she sagged against his chest. And mumbled something he didn&#x27;t understood clutching his arms hard enough to leave marks on his bones. He turned her face to him, &quot;What happened, Aviendha?&quot; he asked again, a bit more firmly than before. He didn&#x27;t like to see her like that, it wasn&#x27;t natural to her.&#xA;&quot;I&#x27;m with a child, &#xA;    Rand&#xA;    al&#x27;Thor.&quot; She answered faintly, her eyes still red from crying. Had she told him that the Dark One was free he wasn&#x27;t as stun as he was now. He stepped away from her, his mouth tried to reach the floor; &quot;You are with&#x2026;&quot; He stopped to swallow hard, he thought his eyes might fall on the floor any moment. Aviendha grunted and she removed his hold in her. Hhe rubbed her arms, only half aware for them. She watch him closely, she wasn&#x27;t joking with him, though he very much wanted her to. &#xA;    &#xA;    &quot;Are you sure? Mine?&quot; he asked before he had regained his hold in himself in disbelief. He cursed himself immediately. Those questions couldn&#x27;t have been planned better to make her more angry. She wouldn&#x27;t have told him if she weren&#x27;t sure and the other question didn&#x2019;t bear thinking about. But it at least explained why she was crying, or half explained it. &#xA;    &#xA;    &quot;Not yours, &#xA;    Rand&#xA;    al&#x27;Thor. Sammael&#x27;s.&quot; Her voice full of sarcasm, and her eyes of lightning &quot;Who else do you think it could be, you fool man? I hadn&#x27;t&#x2026;&quot; she took a ragged breath and glared at him. He glanced at the table where all the drinks were kept, more than a few of them had gone but he found a cup and a jar that Aviendha hadn&#x27;t emptied. Saidin left him when Aviendha talked but now he channeled to fill the cup and send it to him, Aviendha snatched it from the air. Not caring one bit that it was his, and emptied it all in one gulp. &#xA;    Rand&#xA;    sighed and walked to the table, letting saidin to leave him wasn&#x27;t hard this time, he didn&#x27;t want to be too aware around Aviendha, her hands against his arm, her smell. All that threaten to break the wall he tried to create between them so she would be safer, he didn&#x27;t know what he felt for her, only that if she would be harmed he would die. Sometimes he had nightmares of the day he killed Rahvin, but on those he came and found Aviendha dead, they woke him with cold sweat anytime he dreamed them. He had to stay away from her, no matter how hard it was; no matter how it hurt him. &#xA;&#xA;He filled himself a goblet and then turned to Aviendha; she already finished drinking and stepped to fill her cup again. She sat on the floor, sipping from her wine and watched him. He didn&#x27;t understood how she could be so calm, he didn&#x27;t know whatever to start laughing or&#x2026; or&#x2026; he didn&#x27;t know what and he didn&#x27;t care. He sat himself on the floor, facing her with all the courage he could find; she would laugh herself till her death if he would let her know how carefully he had to gather it. &#xA;    &#xA;    &quot;What are we going to do with it?&quot; He said when he was on the floor, not a pace away from her. Aviendha looked at him in surprise, what did she thought he would do. Did she really think that he would abandon her with a child? His child! &#xA;    &#xA;    She just stared at him flatly for a moment, &quot;I must speak with Elayne, &#xA;    Rand&#xA;    al&#x27;Thor. I must!&quot; Her voice was full of urgency. &#xA;    &#xA;    &quot;That is all, Aviendha?&quot; He asked, &quot;Why not asking the sun with her? I&#x27;m trying to find her more than a month now, if I would have known where she is, she would already be here.&quot; He silenced himself when he realized he was all but shouting at her. &#xA;    &#xA;    &quot;She is in a place called Salidar, Rand&#xA;    al&#x27;Thor. Egwene asked us not to tell you, but&#x2026;&quot; Aviendha squeezed her eyes shut for a moment, her face pained. &quot;I need to talk with her, could you&#x2026; would you take me to her, Rand&#xA;    al&#x27;Thor?&quot; He was gaping at her; she knew all that time where Elayne was? And didn&#x27;t tell him. He had found her, the light burn his bones to ashes if he hadn&#x27;t found her. He was so overjoyed that he bent toward Aviendha and kissed her. She hadn&#x27;t even protest; she took his head in her hands and pressed his lips to hers. A thing she did only once, a thing he dreamed of every single night since. He didn&#x27;t mean to do this, it was just an instinct, only his body move on his own, and he kissed Aviendha as thoroughly as he ever had. &#xA;&#xA;The light from the windows woke him in the morning; he was in his bed and there was a body pressed against his. He opened his eyes and saw Aviendha, still sleeping, her hair spread on his shoulder and her head on his chest, so beautiful, so peaceful. &#xA;&#xA;His hand stroked her back, and he let his head fall on the pillow. Lews Therin murmurs in the distance became audible. Love is twice as dangerous as surrendering to saidin and ten times as addictive. &#xA;&#xA;Rand tried very hard not to listen; soon he would go to this Salidar and Elayne. And he had no bloody idea what he felt both toward Elayne and Aviendha, even though one was snuggled in his arms. Blood and bloody flaming ashes, he thought. There was no better way to sum his feeling as this was.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">What would have happened if... Min has died on Dumai&#x27;s WellsRand stared at Min, shock and grief battling each other inside him, the Void had gone as soon as he saw Min&#x27;s eyes, staring at him accusingly, lifelessly.         No! Not again! Shouted Lews Therin, but he hardly noticed the man. He formed the Void inside him, it was easy, the white-red fury the overwhelmed him left no emotions behind it. Only this vast emptiness he remembered from the day he killed Rahvin. He drew as much as he could, and more. Faster than ever before and more of saidin that was safe for him to draw.         He took it all and stopped, even with that amount of the power he could do nothing, Min was dead. The thought was thousands knife cuts, more. The void broke, and he felt tears on his cheeks. Once, on Tear he tried to heal a dead child, with Callandor he could draw more then he could with any other sa&#x27;sangreal save one, and even Callandor was useless against death.         The only other option he had wasn&#x27;t one he could take, not even for Min&#x27;s life. He had been offered that kind of option before, when he knelt near another woman he killed. But now he hadn&#x27;t the madness to excuse his action. He killed Min when he tried to break free, an accident, but it wasn&#x27;t a excuse for him. He wouldn&#x27;t turn to the Dark One, not for any price. That was one oath he meant to keep, he swore it in an other life, but it was still held for him, so many ages after he voiced it.The Void formed, and he drew saidin again, he meant to do exactly what he had done before, but no one died when he last died, now he meant that every Aes Sedai that had captured him would die, everyone who had helped them.         No! This was Lews Therin. I will not die again! The flood of saidin that rushed inside him stopped. Now Lews Therin fought to take saidin from his grasp; fought harder than he ever did before, and Rand didn&#x2019;t have the strength to fight anymore.It was Rand al&#x27;Thor who knelt beside the woman&#x27;s corpse, but Lews Therin was the one who rose from the ground, Rand was shut up to a buzzing fly. Lews Therin used air to lift the woman - Min, that was her name? - he wove all the Five Powers and traveled. Making Min and himself part of saidin, he felt the taint he had to pass to reach to the True Source, felt it burning inside him. Into his soul and bones, but ignored it. The True Source turned the Wheel of Time, and there wasn&#x27;t a faster way to travel, and now time was important then anything else. The madness waited for him, he knew that more then well enough, but he could subside it. For a little time at least.         He laid the woman on the floor on his - Rand&#x27;s, was there any difference between them now? - rooms on Cairhien. And run to the wardrobe, tearing up the traps he had woven and inverted around it, he uncovered two statues, a male and a female holding a crystal globe and wearing a flowing robe.         The grimace he wore was only partly due to what happened, the woman&#x27;s death and his own imprisonment, the taint on saidin was probably cause directly because of those two statues.         He took the male one, the only one of the pair he could use, the other was of no use to him without a female to draw saidar to aid him    Saidin turns the Wheel of Time, and with the ter&#x27;angreal in his hands he could draw enough to make the breaking of the world look like a walk in the park. He reached for the True Source through the sa&#x27;angreal, faintly aware of the huge replica that shined brighter than the sun not very far away from the city; even during the day, it light up the skies like a second sun. He sent it all to the corpse on the floor, kneeling to touch her face.It was better that way, all the Five Powers to search, to seek, the Lord of the Grave was one of the names people gave the Dark One. But the Trollocs called him The Lord of Death, and with the sa&#x27;angreal in his grasp he could challenge the creature himself, and win, maybe. Her breasts started moving, eyes flickering, he could hear the blood starting to rush again in her veins, could see her heart start beating. The amount of the power he drew was beyond his wildest dreams, and he directed it all into the woman body, he could keep it alive as much as he wanted without the sa&#x27;angreal, as an empty shell, a body without a soul. Her eyes opened, not the soulless stare he half expected for, dead eyes while the heart still beat and the body lived, but a live stare, tears trickled down her cheeks, and his. He took a deep breath and was only half aware that it was his first in a long time, almost since the moment he saw that she was dead. Her eyes closed again, but she breathed, and he could feel that there was a soul inside the body. There was one thing he still had to do, he had to move quickly. He knew that he was walking on the edge of madness, on the edge of razor of saidin., but Rand would never do this no matter how much he knew he had to. He traveled again, Min would be alright, she was sleeping now. But there was other thing he had to heal, another wound he create, though this was a long time ago.On the very top of the Dragonmount, the closest thing he had he could call a grave, he looked at the White          Tower     . They needed to learn what it meant to challenge the Lord of the Morning.This time he didn&#x27;t draw from saidin, he drew the taint. Sending it all to the White          Tower     , a trail of darkness as black as balefire was white. He could feel it evilness even as he build walls to stop it from harming him. He had no idea how much time passed, it could have been hours, or day or maybe just a heartbeat, but finally he could reach for the male half of the True Source and feel only saidin, the taint had gone. Sent it to the place that was created because of the taint, to a place that dedicated all its effort in finding and severing men that could touch saidin.         The place from which the order came to those who called themselves Aes Sedai and put him inside a box. He still held on to the power, and he couldn&#x27;t hear the faintest sound from the Tower. He directed the taint to the White          Tower     alone. No one there would have survived this. Not unless they had time to ready themselves, which they didn&#x27;t.Lews Therin released the male half of the One Power. Clean as the female one. And retreated to the shadows in the mind of the man that became the Dragon Reborn. Rand al&#x27;Thor could move, could feel, he cursed Lews Therin, every curse he ever heard, he even passed to the Old Tongue without noticing once or twice. But the man knew what he had doing and Rand wouldn&#x27;t have undone anything of the man&#x27;s doing even if he could have.He didn&#x27;t trusted Lews Therin&#x27;s way of traveling, he didn&#x2019;t know how this worked and he couldn&#x27;t trust what he didn&#x27;t know. The gateway he opened into the utter blackness out of the pattern, on the other hand, was well known to him. He left the White          Tower     behind him, nothing would survive the blast of darkness Lews Therin used to clean saidin and avenge the Aes Sedai. Though the books in the library and the ter&#x27;angreal the Tower kept would survive. He couldn&#x27;t have thought of a fate worse than this to the Aes Sedai. Especially to the Reds, to suffer what he had to suffer every time he had touch the True Source, although it was very quick for them. The gateway closed behind him and the platform - the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai - moved through the darkness to his destiny, Cairhien, and Min. One thing Lews Therin left behind was that he couldn&#x27;t run from duty nor love, the man put it in a different manner, of course, Rand didn&#x27;t doubt that Lews Therin could make Mat blush like ten suns. He sat on the platform and tried to think about something else then Elayne, Aviendha and Min. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, it was one battle he was losing in.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you haven&#x27;t noticed, I read quite a bit. But my most favorite books belong to The Wheel Of Time (Amazon),&#xA;to say that they are excelent would be demeaning, they took up a whole&#xA;year of my life (in which I did little but read the books over and over&#xA;and over and over and over and over and over and over&#xA0;again).    For nearly three years I&#x27;ve managed to avoid reading (but not thinking) about WoT, but I just read New Spring&#xA;    , and it&#x27;s every bit as good as the rest of the books, and it brought me back a rash of memories.&#xA;        I actually was a prolific fanfic writer for a time. My current nickname is based on some of my stories from that time.&#xA;I just found those stories again (I back them up to a CD, then lost the&#xA;CD, and had a HD crash a few months ago that wiped out my remaining&#xA;copies) at the Dragon Library, looking at them now, it seems that I was quite a busy bee then.&#xA;I&#x27;ll post them to this blog as a way of preserving them for the future.&#xA;This is normally a technical blog, but this is too important part of my&#xA;past to ignore. I&#x27;ll put them all under the Writings category, so just&#xA;ignore that if you don&#x27;t want to read it.    As a warning, those stories, like all fanfic, will make no sense whatsoever if you haven&#x27;t read the Wheel of Time.&#xA;Another warning is due, I wrote those stories as a teenager, and I&#xA;don&#x27;t think that I was ever a writer good enough to do justice to the&#xA;story. But it passed the time (two years betwween each book) very nicely.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I currently have in the repository [ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/nqa&#xA0;] the code for both editors.    The Cfg.Xml editor is considered complete and is fully integrated into the UI.    The Hbm.Xml editor is still incomplete, but it already can do very much in terms of editing simple mapping files. The Cfg.Xml was easy to write because it&#x27;s relatively simple (the hard parts were making it easier to use, the type &amp; resource browsers, and they weren&#x27;t really hard).    Mapping files are highly complex, and trying to show them in a usable UI (meaning, avoiding this) and I wrote most of it without network connection, so I had to go with were a couple of hbm files on my HD and no documentations except NHibernate source.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A new version of Boo, the write friendly language is out!     I didn&#x27;t get to do a lot of work with it lately (NQA got in the way), but I&#x27;ve a secret project in it that I hope will have time to finish soon.    It&#x27;s a very good language, and it&#x27;s fun to write code in it.</p>
