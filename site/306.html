        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It seems like I have been trying to get to the piece that actually write to disk for a very long while.  The API from the header file looks to be pretty nice. I would assume that you would call it something like this: TableBuilder builder(options,writableFile);&#xA;builder.Add(&#x201C;one&#x201D;, &#x201C;bar&#x201D;);&#xA;builder.Add(&#x201C;two&#x201D;, &#x201C;foo&#x201D;);&#xA;builder.Finish();&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;There are some things that looks funky. Like Flush(), which has a comment that I don&#x27;t follow: Can be used to ensure that two adjacent entries never live in the same data block.&#xA;Oh well, maybe I need to actually read the code first?&#xA;And immediately we have this:&#xA;&#xA;I think that this explain why you have Flush(), this forces different blocks. Most of the time, you let leveldb handle that, but you can also control that yourself if you really know what you are doing.&#xA;There is something called FilterBlockPolicy, but I don&#x27;t get what it is for, ignoring for now.&#xA;Calling Add() does some really nice things with regards to the implementation. Let us say that we are storing keys with similar postfixes. That is very common.&#xA;When considering leveldb for RavenDB, we decided that we would store the data in this manner:&#xA;&#xA;/users/ayende/data = {} &#xA;/users/ayende/metadata = {}&#xA;Now, when we want to add them, we add the first one and then the second one, but we have a chance to optimize things.&#xA;We can arrange things so we would output:&#xA;&#xA;0,19,2&#xA;/users/ayende/data&#xA;{}&#xA;15, 9, 3&#xA;metadata&#xA;{}&#xA;Note that for the second key, we can reuse the first 15 characters of the previous entry. And we just saved some bytes on the disk.&#xA;Now, blocks are held in memory, and by default they are flushed every 4 KB or so. &#xA;&#xA;Side note: looking at the code, it is really scary just how many times data is copied from one memory location to another in the leveldb codebase. Client code to WriteBatch, WriteBatch to MemTable, MemTable to TableBuilder, etc.&#xA;Okay, so now I am pretty sure that I am following what is going on when writing to disk. Still not sure how you search in an SST. The data is sorted, but that looks like it would require multiple seeks .There is metadata &amp; index blocks in there, but I am not quite sure how they would work. Need to read the reader side of things to really get things. Well, I&#x27;ll do that next time...</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After going over the VersionSet, I understand how leveldb decide when to compact and what it decide to compact. More or less, at least. This means that I now mostly can figure out what this does:  Status DBImpl::BackgroundCompaction()  A user may force manual compaction of a range, or we may have reasons of our own to decide to compact, based on leveldb heuristics. Either way, we get the Compaction object, which tells us what files we need to merge. There is a check there whatever we can do a trivial compaction, that is, just move the file from the current level to level&#x2B;1. The interesting thing is that we avoid doing that if this is going to cause issues in level&#x2B;2 (require more expensive compaction later on).  But the interesting work is done in DoCompactionWork, where we actually do compaction of complex data. The code refers to snapshots for the first time that I see. We only merge values that are in a valid snapshot. So data doesn&#x27;t &#x201C;go away&#x201D; for users. While holding a snapshot active. The actual work starts in here:    This give us the ability to iterate over all of the entries in all of the files that need compaction. And then we go over it:    But note that on each iteration we do a check if we need to CompactMemTable(); I followed the code there, and we finally write stuff to disk! I am quite excited about this, but I&#x27;ll handle that in a future blog post. I want to see how actual compaction works.  We then have this:    This is there to stop a compaction that would force a very expensive compaction next time, I think. As a side note, this really drive me crazy:    Note that we have current_output() and FileSize() in here. I don&#x27;t really care what naming convention you use, but I would really rather that you had one. If there is one for the leveldb code base, I can&#x27;t say that I figured it out. It seems like mostly it is PascalCase, but every now &amp; then we have this_style methods. Back to the code, it took me a while to figure it out.    Will return values in sorted key order, that means that if you have the same key in multiple levels, we need to ignore the older values. After this is happening, we now have this:    This is where we are actually writing stuff out to the SST file! This is quite exciting :-). I have been trying to figure that out for a while now. The rest of the code in the function is mostly stuff related to stats book keeping, but this looks important:   This generate the actual VersionEdit, which will remove all of the files that were compacted and add the new file that was created as a new Version to the VersionSet. Good work so far, even if I say so myself. We actually go to where we are building the SST files. Now it is time to look at the code that build those table. Next post, Table Builder...</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I last left things, we were still digging into the code for Version and figure out that this is a way to handle the list of files, and that it is the table cache that is actually doing IO. For this post, I want to see where continuing to read the Version code will take us. There are some interesting things going on in here. We use the version to do a lot more. For example, because it holds all of the files, we can use it to check if they are overlaps in key spaces, which leveldb can use to optimize things later on. I am not sure that I am following everything that is going on there, but I start to get the shape of things. As I understand things right now. Data is stored in the following levels:  MemTable &#x2013; where all the current updates are going  Immutable MemTable &#x2013; which is frozen, and probably in the process of being written out  Level 0 &#x2013; probably just a dump of the mem table to disk, key ranges may overlap, so you may need to read multiple files to know where a particular value is.  Level 1 to 6 &#x2013; files where keys cannot overlap, so you probably only need one seek to find things. But seeks are still charged if you need to go through multiple levels to find a value.  That make sense, and it explains things like charging seeks, etc. Now, I am currently going over VersionSet::Builder, which appears to be applying something called VersionEdit efficiently. I don&#x27;t know what any of those things are yet... VersionEdit appears to be a way to hold (and maybe store on disk?) data about pending changes to a version. This is currently not really useful because I still don&#x27;t know how that is used. This means that I need to go deeper into the VersionSet code now. VersionSet::LogAndApply looks like it is an interesting candidate for behavior. I also found why we need VersionEdit to be persistable, we write it to the manifest file. Probably as a way to figure out what is going on when we recover. LogAndApply write the VersionEdit to a manifest file, then set the current file to point to that manifest file. I am currently reading the Recover function, and it seems to be applying things in reverse. It reads the CURRENT file which points to the current manifest, which contains the serialized VersionEdit contents. Those are read in turn, after which we apply the edit to the in memory state.  Toward the end of VersionSet.cc file, we start seeing things regards compaction. Like: Iterator* VersionSet::MakeInputIterator(Compaction* c) Compaction* VersionSet::PickCompaction() I sort of follow and sort of doesn&#x27;t follow what the code is doing there. It selects the appropriate set of files that need to be compacted. I don&#x27;t really get the actual logic, I&#x27;ll admit, but hopefully that will become better when I read the rest of the code. Compaction appears to work on level and level&#x2B;1 files. I assume that it is going to read all of those files, merge them into level&#x2B;1 and then delete (or mark for deletion) the existing files. This is now close to midnight, and my eyes started building and the code started to do gymnastics on the screen, so I&#x27;ll call it a post for now.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, after spending quite a lot of time digging through the leveldb codebase, and with several years of working with RavenDB, I can say with confidence that the CLR make it extremely hard to build high performance server side systems using the CLR. Mostly, the issues are related to GC and memory. In particular, not having any way to control memory allocation and/or the GC means that we can&#x2019;t optimize those scenarios in any meaningful way. At the same time, I do not want to go back to the unmanaged world. As mentioned ,I just came back from a very deep dive into a non trivial C&#x2B;&#x2B; codebase ,and while I consider that codebase a really good one, that ain&#x2019;t to say it is a pleasure to always be thinking about all the stuff that the CLR just takes away. Therefor, I decided that I&#x2019;m going to be doing something about it. And Rattlesnake.CLR was born:  The major features of the Rattlesnake.CLR include explicit memory management when required. Let us say that we know that we are going to be needing some amount of memory for a while, and then all of that can be thrown away. This is extremely common in scenarios such as a web request, pretty much all the memory that you generate during the processing web request can be safely free immediately. In RavenDB&#x2019;s case, the memory we consume during indexing can be free immediately when we stop indexing. Right now this is a painful process of making sure that we allocate within the same gen0 and hoping that it won&#x2019;t be too expensive, or that we won&#x2019;t get a complete halt of the entire server while it is releasing memory. It also make it really hard to do things like limit the amount of memory your code uses. Another requirement that I have is that Rattlesnake.CLR should be able to execute existing .NET assemblies without any additional steps. Since I don&#x2019;t fancy doing ports of stuff that already exists. In order to handle this scenario with the given constraints, we have:      1: var heap = Heap.Create(HeapOptions.None,    2:     1024 * 1024,   3:     512 * 1024 * 1024);   4:&#xA0;    5: using(MemoryAllocations.AllocateFrom(heap))   6: {   7:    var sb = new StringBuilder();   8:    for(var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i &#x2B;&#x2B; )   9:          sb.AppendLine(i);  10:    Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());  11: }  12:&#xA0;   13: heap.Destroy(); &#xA;All the code within the using statement is allocated in our own heap. In line 13, we are destroying all of that memory in one fell swoop.&#xA;There are a few notes about this that we probably should address:&#xA;&#xA;By default, memory allocated by this form is not subject to any form of GC. The idea is that this whole heap is getting released immediately.&#xA;Note that last two parameters for the Heap.Create. The first is the initial size of the heap, and the second is&#xA0; the max size. We now have a real way to actually limit the amount of memory a piece of code will use. This is really important on server applications where avoiding paging is critical.&#xA;For that matter, we can now figure out how much memory a particular piece of code uses, and allocate our resources accordingly.&#xA;You can use multiple heaps at the same time, although only one can be installed as the default allocation at a given point in time.&#xA;There is the explicit heap.GarbageCollect() method that will do GC only on that heap, and which you can schedule at your own convenience.&#xA0; You can have two heaps, and allocate from one while you are GCing from the other. And yes ,that means that GCs using this methods will not stop the process!&#xA;Memory allocated on the heap is obviously only valid as long as the heap is valid. That means that once the heap is destroyed, you can&#x2019;t access any of the objects that were created there. This has implications for things like cache. We provide MemoryAllocations.AllocateOnGlobalHeap&lt;T&gt;(args) method to force you to use the global heap, instead, if you want this memory to be always available and subject to GC.&#xA;This is early days yet, but we already see some really interesting performance improvements!&#xA;How does this work?&#xA;While an early experiment with Rattlensake.CLR was based on the Mono runtime. I quickly decided that I wanted to keep using the MS CLR. Now, it order to handle this I had to do some unnatural things (to say the least), but I think that I even managed to make this a supported option. Essentially, we are using the CLR Hosting API for this. In particular:&#xA;&#xA;ICLRGCManager&#xA;IHostMalloc&#xA;IHostMemoryManager &#xA;You can use Rattlesnake.CLR like this:&#xA;&#xA;.\Rattlesnake.exe Raven.Server.exe&#xA;Just for fun, we also allowed to place limits on the default heap, so you can be sure that you aren&#x2019;t allocating too much there.&#xA;&#xA;.\Rattlesnake.exe Raven.Server.exe --max-default-heap-size=256MB&#xA;We are still running some tests, but this is looking really good.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just got myself a UFO Mini Helicopter, it looks like this:  This is the first helicopter that I got, and for a 30$ toy, it is an awesome amount of fun. The only complaint that I have is that this has only about 5 minutes of battery life. I am really bad at flying it, too.  As mentioned, this is the very first helicopter that I bought, and I think that I would like to have a better one for the next time. Any recommendations from you guys?  I would like a better battery life. 30 minutes &#x2013; 1 hour would be what I want. Should be pretty resistant to crashes. I know that I am going to crash it a lot. Any recommendations?</p>
