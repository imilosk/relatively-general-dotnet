            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was always somewhat baffled that something that was so obviously required so often can be so expensive with RDBMSes. When diving deep into B-Tree implementation I suddenly found it obvious why that is the case. Let us look at the following B-Tree:  Now, if I asked you how many entries you had in this tree, you would have to visit each and every page. And that can be very expensive when you have large number of items. But why can&#x2019;t we just keep track of the total number ourselves? There is counting B-Trees that we can use that will give us the answer in O(1) time. The answer to that is that it is too expensive to maintain this. Imagine a big tree, with 10 million records, and a fan out of 16 keys per page. That means that it has a depth of 6. Let us say that we want to add a new record. We can do that by modifying and saving the page. That would cost us 4KB of writes. However, if we use a counting B-Tree, we have to update all of the parent pages. With a depth of 6, that means that instead of writing 4KB to disk we will have to write 24KB to disk. And probably have to do multiple seeks to actually do the write properly. That is an unacceptable performance cost, and the reason why you have to manually check all the pages when you want the full count.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the annoying things about doing performance work is that you sometimes feel like you found the problem. You fix it, and another pops out. After the previous run of work, we have tackled two important perf issues:  Immutable collections &#x2013; which were replaced with more memory intensive but hopefully faster safe collections. Transaction contention from background work &#x2013; which we reduced and close to eliminated. Once we have done that, it is time to actually look at the code in the profiler again. Note that I am writing this while I am traveling on the train (on battery power), so you can pretty much ignore any actual numbers, we want to look at the percentages.  Let us look at the contention issue first. Here is the old code:   And the new one:   We still have some cost, but that appears to have been drastically cut down. I&#x2019;ll call it good for now. What about transaction commit? Here is the old code:    And here is the new one:   What we can see is that our change didn&#x2019;t actually improve anything much. In fact, we are worse off. We&#x2019;ll probably go with a more complex system of chained dictionaries, rather than the just plain copying that appears to be causing so much trouble. However, there is something else to now. Both Commit and NewTransaction together are less than 60% of the cost of the operation. The major cost is actually in adding item to the in memory tree:   In particular, it looks like finding the right page to place the item is what is costing us so much. We added 2 million items (once sequential, once random), which means that we need to do an O(logN) operation 2 million times. I don&#x2019;t know if we can improve on the way it works for random writes, but we should be able to do something about how it behaves for sequential writes.  a</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After the issues we run into with immutable structures, I decided that I still wanted to maintain the same guarantees that immutable data structures gave us, but that still maintain the speed of mutable structures. I managed to do that by making different design choices when building my implementation. While the BCL immutable collections are based on binary trees, and attempt to spare GC pressure in favor of CPU cycles, I find that for a lot of the things that we do, we can spare the memory in favor of actually being faster overall. In particular, this is true since the immutable collections are order of magnitude slower for reads than their mutable counterparts. I could have dealt with the slow writes, somehow. But we do a lot of reads, and that is utterly unacceptable. Here is how I implemented SafeList:      1: public class SafeList&lt;T&gt; : IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;   2: {   3:     List&lt;T&gt; _inner = new List&lt;T&gt;();   4:&#xA0;    5:     public static readonly SafeList&lt;T&gt; Empty = new SafeList&lt;T&gt;();   6:&#xA0;    7:     private SafeList()   8:     {   9:&#xA0;   10:     }  11:&#xA0;   12:     public SafeList&lt;T&gt; AddRange(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items)  13:     {  14:         var inner = new List&lt;T&gt;(_inner);  15:         inner.AddRange(items);  16:         return new SafeList&lt;T&gt;  17:         {  18:             _inner = inner  19:         };  20:     }  21:&#xA0;   22:     public SafeList&lt;T&gt; Add(T item)  23:     {  24:         return new SafeList&lt;T&gt;  25:         {  26:             _inner = new List&lt;T&gt;(_inner) {item}  27:         };  28:     }  29:&#xA0;   30:     public int Count  31:     {  32:         get { return _inner.Count; }  33:     }  34:&#xA0;   35:     public T this[int i]  36:     {  37:         get { return _inner[i]; }  38:     }  39:&#xA0;   40:&#xA0;   41:     public SafeList&lt;T&gt; RemoveAll(Func&lt;T, bool&gt; filter)  42:     {  43:         return new SafeList&lt;T&gt;  44:         {  45:             _inner = new List&lt;T&gt;(_inner.Where(x =&gt; filter(x) == false))  46:         };  47:     }  48:&#xA0;   49:     public T Find(Predicate&lt;T&gt; predicate)  50:     {  51:         return _inner.Find(predicate);  52:     }  53:&#xA0;   54:     public SafeList&lt;T&gt; RemoveAllAndGetDiscards(Predicate&lt;T&gt; filter, out List&lt;T&gt; discards)  55:     {  56:         var list = new List&lt;T&gt;();  57:&#xA0;   58:         discards = list;  59:&#xA0;   60:         return new SafeList&lt;T&gt;  61:         {  62:             _inner = new List&lt;T&gt;(_inner.Where(x =&gt;  63:             {  64:                 if (filter(x) == false)  65:                 {  66:                     list.Add(x);  67:                     return false;  68:                 }  69:                 return true;  70:             }))  71:         };  72:&#xA0;   73:     }  74: }&#xA;The implementation for SafeDictionary is pretty similar as well. Note that I have dedicated &amp; optimized methods for the type of things that I need in my code.&#xA;But the key part here is that I gain the safety by always creating another copy of the underlying implementation. We are never actually mutating anything. &#xA;Sure, this results in us having to deal with a lot more allocations, but we get the same speed for reads as you do for the standard mutable collections. And more importantly, we are still faster for writes.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Why is the performance of an immutable list over 16 times slower than a standard list? I took a peek at what it was actually doing, and it made a lot of sense. In order to maintain efficient indexing access, the actual storage of the data in the immutable list is a binary tree. With the key being used as the indexer. This result is a much higher cost for pretty much everything. Let us look at the following:      1: var listsp = Stopwatch.StartNew();   2: var list = new List&lt;int&gt;(Enumerable.Range(0, 10*1000*1000));   3:&#xA0;    4: for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.Count; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   5: {   6:     var _ = list[i];   7: }   8:&#xA0;    9: Console.WriteLine(listsp.Elapsed);  10:&#xA0;   11: var ilist = ImmutableList&lt;int&gt;.Empty.AddRange(list);  12: listsp.Restart();  13:&#xA0;   14: for (int i = 0; i &lt; ilist.Count; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)  15: {  16:     var _ = ilist[i];  17: }  18: Console.WriteLine(listsp.Elapsed);&#xA;This List&lt;T&gt; is 0.23 seconds, ImmutableList&lt;T&gt; takes 1.28 seconds. When I use foreach, instead, we get 0.22 seconds vs. 2.29 seconds.&#xA;As you can see from the blog post describing them, because immutable collections are mostly implemented as binary trees, I don&#x2019;t really think that there is a good way to approach this as is. The problem is that the immutable collections actually need to do a lot more than what I need them to do.&#xA;Now, it might have been more acceptable to use them if the perf was limited to just writing to them, it might have been acceptable. But as you can see, we have the same problem when we are reading, and that is quite unacceptable.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After finding out that a lot of our costs in Voron is actually related to immutable collections, I decided to run some isolated perf tests.          1: private static void Dictionary()   2: {   3:     var dic = new Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt;();   4:     var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();   5:&#xA0;    6:     for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10*1000*1000; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   7:     {   8:         var obj = new object();   9:         dic[obj] = obj;  10:     }  11:&#xA0;   12:     Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);  13: }                                                          &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: private static void ImmutableDictionary()   2: {   3:     var dic = ImmutableDictionary&lt;object,object&gt;.Empty;   4:     var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();   5:&#xA0;    6:     for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10 * 1000 * 1000; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   7:     {   8:         var obj = new object();   9:         dic = dic.SetItem(obj, obj);  10:     }  11:&#xA0;   12:     Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);  13: }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3.639 seconds&#xA;&#xA;1 minute and 58 seconds&#xA;Yes, that is correct, the immutable version is over thirty times slower. And given that we are only using 10 million items, that is a ridiculous high rate.&#xA;I decided to do some tests to see if it is just the number of calls that we are making here:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: private static void ImmutableDictionary()   2: {   3:     var dic = ImmutableDictionary&lt;object,object&gt;.Empty;   4:     var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();   5:&#xA0;    6:     dic = dic.SetItems(Enumerable.Range(0, 10*1000*1000).Select(i =&gt;   7:     {   8:         var obj = new object();   9:         return new KeyValuePair&lt;object, object&gt;(obj, obj);  10:     }));  11:       12:     Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);  13: }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1 minute&#xA;So that it appears that it isn&#x2019;t the number of calls, but something intrinsic to the way it works. And how about lists?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: private static void List()   2: {   3:     var list = new List&lt;object&gt;();   4:     var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();   5:&#xA0;    6:     for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10 * 1000 * 1000; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   7:     {   8:         var obj = new object();   9:         list.Add(obj);  10:     }  11:&#xA0;   12:     Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);  13: }                                                           &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: private static void ImmutableList()   2: {   3:     var list = ImmutableList&lt;object&gt;.Empty;   4:     var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();   5:&#xA0;    6:     for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10 * 1000 * 1000; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   7:     {   8:         var obj = new object();   9:         list = list.Add(obj);  10:     }  11:&#xA0;   12:       13:     Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);  14: }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;0.9 seconds&#xA;&#xA;16 seconds&#xA;Ouch.&#xA;I think we are going to need to do something about this, even though I love the idea of immutable collections, 16 &#x2013; 32 times slower is just going to be utterly unacceptable.&#xA;But this is for writes, how about reads?&#xA;I had written the following for both of them:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();   2: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10*1000*1000; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   3: {   4:     object value;   5:     dic1.TryGetValue(i, out value);   6: }   7:&#xA0;    8: Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: var sp1 = Stopwatch.StartNew();   2:&#xA0;    3: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10 * 1000 * 1000; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   4: {   5:     object value;   6:     dic2.TryGetValue(i, out value);   7: }   8: Console.WriteLine(sp1.Elapsed);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;0.45 seconds&#xA;&#xA;3.11 seconds&#xA;So the summary is, the performance for our workloads is probably going to be simply unacceptable. We&#x2019;ll have to find another way to handle this. The way to handle this nicely is to basically copy the values. So I wanted to know how long it would take to fully clone a 10 millions items dictionary. The answer: 0.6 seconds. Doing the same with immutable dictionary? 16 seconds.&#xA;So we are going to need to do something else .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Earlier this month I posted our results for the initial performance of Voron. We learned a lot from that, and it led us to do some major refactoring to the codebase. Now, we are back on a more or less stable ground, so it is time to actually see what is going on. Where before we had a baseline against other storage engines, now we are testing against the previous version as well as Esent. To get a good and fixed numbers, I decided to run the tests on a EC2 machine, in particular, an m1.large instance. The idea is that this gives us a simple way to get a standard machine config that anyone can use to test out as well. For the purpose of this benchmark, we are doing writes to one of the temporary storage disks, rather than a permanent EBS drive. This will presumably be somewhat faster than real world configuration, but I think that running in an environment where we are actually using a common production machine (rather than a dedicated development machine) should give us better numbers, certainly more realistic ones. The first thing to check, of course, is the simplest. Sequential writes: &#xA0; Here we can see that we are actually worse off than we were before. That is actually kind of sad. But we&#x2019;ll get to that later on. For random reads, we are still very good, and it is obvious that we are pretty early make use of all of the resources that the machine gives us. Here we are consistently slightly faster than the older version, but that is something that is probably accidental. We certainly did no work on improving read performance (there was very little need to do so, after all).  Random writes was&#xA0; a big surprise:  As it happens, it appears that we are faster, significantly so, than Esent in this scenario. Which was quite a surprise. For some reason, we are also faster in the new code than the old version. Which is quite interesting. Finally, we have random reads.   No, it isn&#x2019;t an error. We see a rate of ~1,600 reads/sec for Esent single threaded. I am not quite sure why this is behaving in this fashion, but I am willing to say that there is something wrong and just discount this result. I mentioned before that it appears that we are actually slower than the old code. So I decided to check what is actually going on there. My tool of choice, the profiler.&#xA0; Here is the old version:  You can see that we have done two runs (one sequential, one random) of 10,000 transactions, writing a total of 2 million items. And roughly 26% of the time is spent committing the transaction. Digging into that, a lot of that time is spent just flushing to disk:   Note, however, that a decidedly non trivial amount of time is actually spent on ImmutableDictionary, but I&#x2019;ll touch on that later on. With our changes, the new code looks like:  The one thing that jumps at me is that the cost of creating a transaction is now very significant. And here is why:  The actual reason for this is likely that we also have the background journal flushing, that now also needs to take the transaction lock. Which is introducing contention into the mix. We&#x2019;ll need to look into how to resolve that. Let us dig into the commit. The change there was pretty much the whole reason for what we were doing.  You can see that we are using WriteFileGather, and unlike before, where syncing took about 15% of the overall time. Now it is taking just 7%. So we are better than 50% improvement on that score. But the really interesting bit? Look at what was by far the most expensive operation there. It was the calls to immutable dictionary. In fact, let us look at the results in the profiler for the immutable collections:   So now we have two new things that we need to investigate. One is reducing contentions, and the second is checking how we can optimize our usage of the immutable collections. I&#x2019;ll report on our finding&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was asked to review the book (and received a free electronic copy).  As someone that is very into storage engines, I was quite excited about this. After going over the leveldb codebase, I would finally get to read a real book about how it works. I was disappointed, badly. This book isn&#x2019;t really about leveldb. It contains pretty much no background, explanation, history or anything much at all about how leveldb works. Instead, it is pretty much a guide of how to use LevelDB to write iOS application. There is a lot of chapters dealing with Objective-C, NSString and variants, how to do binding, how to handle drag and drop.  However, things that I would expect. Such as explanations of how it works, what does it do, alternative use cases, etc are very rare, if there at all. Only chapter 10 is really worth reading, and even so, I got the feeling that it only made sense to me because I already knew quite a lot leveldb already. I can&#x2019;t imagine actually starting from scratch and actually being able to understand leveldb from this book.  If you are working on iOS apps / OS X, I guess that this might be a good choice, but only if you want to know about actually implementing leveldb. You&#x2019;ll need to do your actual leveldb learning elsewhere. The book does contain some interesting tidbits. Chapter 10 is talking about tuning and key policies, and it did have some interesting things to talk about, but it also contain wrong information* (and if I could spot it, with my relatively little experience with leveldb, I&#x2019;m pretty sure that there are other things there too that are wrong). * The book said that is it better to write keys in order, to reduce I/O. But leveldb writes to a skip list in memory, then flush that entire thing in sorted fashion to disk. Your writes have to be bigger than the buffer size of that to actually matter, and that still won&#x2019;t help you much. In short, feel free to skip this book, unless you are very focused on writing leveldb apps on iOS. In which case it might be a worth it, but I don&#x2019;t think so. You are better off reading the docs or any of the tutorials.</p>
