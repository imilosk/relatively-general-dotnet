            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was recently at a private company event (not my company, I was invited, along with others, because we have a close association to that company). The event itself wasn&#x2019;t notable, but there was one thing that really bothered me, before the event actually started, there was the usual phase when everyone is munching on the snacks and mingling. The food was some sort of green cupcakes with inspirational messages on them: &#x201C;think positive&#x201D;, &#x201C;fitting the world to you&#x201D;, etc.   All in all, I found that somewhat strange, but I didn&#x2019;t really care, but I was talking with a few friends when a woman walked up to us and started handing out coupons for some free demo courses using a whole new technique, etc. I was quite taken aback. I am used to stuff like that on conferences floors, where you have booth babes doing stuff like that, but that was a private meeting of less than fifty people, and I couldn&#x2019;t understand what was going on.  It helped that the woman kept dropping the same phrases that appeared on the cupcakes. That was later confirmed at the beginning of the meeting, where the presenter stood up and started by thanking the sponsors for bringing the food, etc.  Looking back at this, I am both appalled, amazed and utterly unsurprised (you can be both at the same time, it seems). That company actually sold sponsorship for an internal, private, meeting. I don&#x2019;t really know what was the point, if they were trying to save money on the food or they were actually making money out of this, but that behavior really bother me.   I am absolutely for commercialization, if only because the bank would otherwise object, but I was utterly stunned by how crass it was.   What is next? Hiring employees for the express purpose of watching commercials while the company is getting paid for that?  More to the point, there is some expectation about how such functions are going to be, and stunts like that are leaving very bad impression.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There is a tendency to reach the debugger for every error that you run, but in most cases, it is the exception (and the exception stack) that provides enough to solve the problem in 99% of the cases.  Case in point, I made some changes to Uber Prof and run the tests. For various reasons, I had to reinstall SQLExpress, and all the Java related tests failed, throwing up copious amount of error text in my lap. I cringe when they do that, because it means having to setup the Java environment and having to check how to do things like real debugging in Java (something I have very little knowledge of).  I did just that, spending over an hour getting things to a position where I could run everything properly. Then I run a scenario and got an error, then I looked at the exception stack:     Moron, did I mention already?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just had to respond to this post, Davy Brion talks about the Ruby community, and he had the following to say:     When i asked them about interesting resources to follow as a newbie Rubyist, they all gladly shared their suggestions. When i thanked them for it, they all replied stating that i should feel free to contact them if i had any more questions about whatever Ruby related. Seriously, can you imagine the few .NET heroes that we have responding to questions through email from people they don&#x2019;t even know like that? I can&#x2019;t. Hell, i know most of them don&#x2019;t respond like that. The few that do are still trying to earn their MVP award or are too worried about renewing their MVP status.   Ignoring the MVP dig, allow me to explain exactly what is going on.  In the last 48 hours:    &#xA0;   &#xA0;             &#xA0;     Those are all cold requests, from people I have never met, and all to my private email. Note that in most cases, there is a dedicated mailing list for the topic in question.  For that matter, the last two days has been decidedly quiet in the NHibernate front, this represent a more realistic sample of what is going on:     And those are in addition to the business, private, mailing list and other stuff that I do in email.  Putting it simply, there is too much traffic for me to welcome most cold questions with anything more than a direction to the appropriate mailing list. This isn&#x2019;t about being rude, or uncaring, this is about actually being able to do any work at all.</p>

One story that I had hard time understanding was the Super If.  Basically, it looked like this:     I had a hard time accepting that someone could write an if condition that long. I kept assuming that they meant that the if statements were 50 lines long, but that wasn&#x2019;t the case.  And then yesterday I had an even more horrifying story. A WCF service making a call to the database always timed out on the first request, but worked afterward. What would be your first suspicion? Mine was that it took time to establish the database connection, and that after the first call the connection resided in the connection pool.   They laughed at my naivety, for it wasn&#x2019;t connecting to the database that caused the timeout, it was JITting the method that the WCF service ended up calling.  Yep, you got that right, JITting a single method (because the runtime only JIT a single method at a time). I had even harder time believing that, until they explained to me how that method was built:          Some interesting stats:     It had a Cyclomatic Complexity of either 4,000 or 8,000, the client couldn&#x2019;t remember.    The entire Rhino Mocks codebase fits in 13,000 LOC, so this single method could contain it several times over.   But you know what the really scary part is?  I upgraded from Super If to Black Hole Methods, and I am afraid to see what happen today, because if I get something that top the Black Hole Method, I may have to hand back my keyboard and go raise olives.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently had a chance to work on an interesting project, doing a POC of moving from a relational model to RavenDB. And one of the most interesting hurdles along the way wasn&#x2019;t technical at all, it was trying to decide what an entity is. We are so used to make the assumption that Entity == Table that we started to associate the two together. With a document database, an entity is a document, and that map much more closely to a root aggregate than to a RDMBS entity.  That gets very interesting when we start looking at tables and having to decide if they represent data that is stand alone (and therefore deserve to live is separate documents) or whatever they should be embedded in the parent document. That led to a very interesting discussion on each table. What I found remarkable is that it was partly a discussion that seem to come directly from the DDD book, about root aggregates, responsibilities and the abstract definition of an entity and partly a discussion that focused on meeting the different modeling requirement for a document database.  I think that we did a good job, but I most valued the discussion and the insight. What was most interesting to me was how right was RavenDB for the problem set, because a whole range of issues just went away when we started to move the model over.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had an interesting conversation with a guy about some problem he was having. This was just one of those &#x201C;out of the blues&#x201D; contacts that happen, when someone contact me to ask a question. He presented a problem that I see all too often, trying to create a system in which the entities are doing everything, and he run into problems with that (to be fair, he run into a unique set of problems with that). I gave him a list of blog posts are articles to read, suggesting the right path to go. After a few days, he replied with:     I went over your advised reading in depth, but let me describe in short the properties and functions of our system, which I think causes the system to be an exception to those methods.   He then proceed to outlay his problem, a proposed solution and then asked a very specific NHibernate question that was a blocking stumbling block to get ahead with the solution he wanted. My reply was that he took the wrong approach, a suggestion how to resolve it in a different manner and a link to our NHibernate Commercial Support option.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I decided to take a chance (installing Oracle is a big leap :-) ) and see how things match in Oracle.  I decided to run the following query:     SELECT deptno, &#xA;       dname, &#xA;       loc, &#xA;       (SELECT COUNT(*) &#xA;        FROM   emp &#xA;        WHERE  emp.deptno = dept.deptno) AS empcount &#xA;FROM   dept &#xA;WHERE  deptno = 20 &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Please note that I run in on a database that had (total) maybe a 100 records, so the results may be skewed.&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Like in the SQL Server case, we need to create an index on the FK column. I did so, after which I got:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Then I dropped that index and create a simple view:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  CREATE VIEW depswithempcount &#xA;AS &#xA;  SELECT deptno, &#xA;         dname, &#xA;         loc, &#xA;         (SELECT COUNT(*) &#xA;          FROM   emp &#xA;          WHERE  emp.deptno = dept.deptno) AS empcount &#xA;  FROM   dept &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Querying on top of that gives me the same query plan as before. Trying to create a materialized view out of this fails, because of the subquery expression, I&#x2019;ll have to express the view in terms of joins, instead. Like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  SELECT dept.deptno, &#xA;       dname, &#xA;       loc, &#xA;       COUNT(*) empcount &#xA;FROM   dept &#xA;       LEFT JOIN emp &#xA;         ON dept.deptno = emp.deptno &#xA;WHERE  dept.deptno = 20 &#xA;GROUP  BY dept.deptno, &#xA;          dname, &#xA;          loc &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Interestingly enough, this is a different query plan than the subquery, with SQL Server, those two query exhibit identical query plans.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Now, to turn that into an materialized view.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  CREATE materialized VIEW deptwithempcount &#xA;AS SELECT dept.deptno, &#xA;          dname, &#xA;          loc, &#xA;          COUNT(*) empcount &#xA;   FROM   dept &#xA;          left join emp &#xA;            ON dept.deptno = emp.deptno &#xA;   GROUP  BY dept.deptno, &#xA;             dname, &#xA;             loc &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;And querying on this gives us very interesting results:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  select * from deptwithempcount &#xA;where deptno = 20&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Unlike SQL Server, we can see that Oracle is reading everything from the view. But let us try one more thing, before we conclude this with a victory.&#xA;&#xA;update emp &#xA;set deptno = 10&#xA;where deptno = 20;&#xA;&#xA;select * from deptwithempcount &#xA;where deptno = 20&#xA;&#xA;But now, when we re-run the materialized view query, we see the results as they were at the creation of the view.&#xA;&#xA;There appears to be a set of options to control that, but the one that I want (RERESH FAST), which update the view as soon as data changes will not work with this query, since it consider it too complex. I didn&#x2019;t investigate too deeply, but it seems that this is another dead end.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">An interesting thing happened recently, when I started to build the profiler, a lot of the features were what I call Core Features. Those were the things that without which, we wouldn&#x2019;t have a product. Things like detecting SQL, merging it into sessions, providing reports, etc. What I find myself doing recently with the profiler is not so much building Core Features, but building UX features. In other words, now that we have this in place, let us see how we can make better use of this.   Case in point, the new features that were just released in build 713. They aren&#x2019;t big, but they are there to improve how people are commonly using the products.  Renaming a session:     This is primarily useful if you are in a long profiling session and you want to mark a specific session with some notation:       Small feature, and individually not very useful. But you might have noticed that the sessions are marked with stars around them. They weren&#x2019;t there is previous builds, so what are they?     They are a way to tell the profiler that you really like those sessions :-)  More to the point, such sessions will not be removed when you clear the current state. That lets you keep around the previous state of the application as a base line while you work to improve it. Beside, it makes it much easier to locate them visually.  And finally, as a quicker way to do that, you can just ask the profiler to clear all but the selected features.     Not big features, but nice ones, I think.</p>
