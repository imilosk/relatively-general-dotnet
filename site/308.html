            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Finding the appropriate image for this post was hard, you try searching for &#x201C;racy pictures&#x201D; in Google Image Search, but you might not want to do it from work . Anyway, today at lunch we had a discussion about abstractions and at what level you should be working. The talk centered about the difference between working in low level C and working with a high level framework like C# and the relative productivity associated with it. At one point the following argument was raised: &#x201C;Well, consider the fact that you never need to implement List, for example&#x201D;. To which my reaction was: &#x201C;I did just that last week&#x201D;. Now, to forestall the nitpickers, pretty much any C developer will have an existing library of common data structures already in place, I know. And no, you shouldn&#x2019;t be implementing basic data structures unless you have a really good reason. In my case, I think I did. The issue is very simple. I need to have a collection of items that are safe for multi threaded reads, but they are mostly only ever accessed from a single thread, and are only ever modified by a single thread. Oh, and they are also extremely performance sensitive. The reason we started looking into replacing them is that the concurrent data structures that we were using (ConcurrentDictionary &amp; ConcurrentStack, in those cases) were too expensive. And a large part of that was because they gave us a lot more than what we actually needed (fully concurrent access). So, how do we build a simple list that allow for the following:  Only one thread can write. Multiple threads can read. No synchronization on either end. Stale reads allowed. The key part here is the fact that we allow stale reads.  Here is the concrete scenario, we need to track all active transactions. A transaction is single threaded, but we allow thread hopping (because of async). So we define:  And then we have:  DynamicArray is just a holder for an array of Nodes. Whenever we need to add an item to the active transactions, we&#x2019;ll get the local thread value, and do a linear search through the array. If we find a node that has a null Transaction value, we&#x2019;ll use it. Otherwise, we&#x2019;ll add a new Node value to the end of the array. If we run out of room in the array, we&#x2019;ll double the array size.&#xA0; All pretty standard stuff, so far. Removing a value from the array is also simple, all you need to do is to null the Transaction field on the relevant node.  Why all of this? Well, only a single thread can ever register a transaction for a particular DynamicArray instance. That means that we don&#x2019;t have to worry about concurrency here. However, we do need to worry about transactions that need to remove themselves from the list from other threads. That is why we don&#x2019;t have any concurrency control here. Instead, removing the transaction is done by setting the node&#x2019;s Transaction field to null. Since only the owning transaction can do that, this is safe. Other threads, however, need to read this information. They do that by scanning through all the thread values, and then accessing the DynamicArray directly. Now, that means that we need to be safe for concurrent reading. This is done by having the array more or less static on most scenarios. After it get full enough, it will never grow again, and the values will remain there, so effectively other threads will be reading an array of Nodes. We do need to be careful when we expand the array to give more room. We do this by first creating the new array, copying the values to the new array, and only then setting it in the threaded instance.  This way, concurrent code may either see the old array or the new one, but never need to traverse both. And when traversing, it goes through the nodes and check their Transaction value.  Remember that the Transaction is only being set from the original thread, but can be reset from another thread if the transaction moved between threads. We don&#x2019;t really care, the way it works, we read the node&#x2019;s transaction field, and then check its value (once we have a stable reference). The idea is that we don&#x2019;t worry about data races. The worst that can happen is that we&#x2019;ll see an older view of the data, which is perfectly fine for our purposes.  This is pretty complex, but the code itself is simple enough, and the performance benefit justify it several times over.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Some of the performance work that I have been doing recently was complex, and then, some of it isn&#x2019;t:  And its implementation:  And the optimized version:  And the result?  The really interesting thing is that we have an improvement that is about 3 times more than we would expect. Why is that? We can see that we eliminated the ResouceName call, and saved all of that cost, but we have much lower cost overall, where did that come from? This is something that we saw over and over again. The obvious answer is that we now do less allocations, so we have less GC work to do, which is true as far as it goes, but it is also true that when we are even slightly faster, things start to align more closely, and we get a chain reaction (slightly less work means more time process the actual requests, so we can get more done in less).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This series is no longer appropriately named, but we&#x2019;ll go with that for the sake of grouping everything together. So far we have seen how we start with a fixed benchmark, and we use a profiler to narrow down all sort of hotspots. However, we do that in a pretty strange way. Consider were we started:  Now consider this series&#x2019; name. Why are we even looking at OpenReadTransaction in the first place? There is a big giant hotspot in GetDocumentsById that we can start with. Even a small change there is likely to generate a lot more results for our benchmark than eliminating everything else entirely. So why focus on those first? Put simply, this isn&#x2019;t just about this particular benchmark. We focused on everything else because those are costs that are shared across the board. Not only for the &#x201C;read random documents&#x201D; benchmark but for pretty much anything else in RavenDB.  By reducing those costs, we are enabling ourselves to get much better performance overall. And we&#x2019;ll get to the actual meat of this benchmark late, when it takes the bulk of the work.  Look at the relative costs here. We moved from 60% of the request being spent there to over 80% being spent there. (Don&#x2019;t look at the actual number, different machines, load and timing are responsible for those). Now any work that we do here will have much greater impact.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As an aside, I wonder how much stuff will break because the title of this post has  in it. The topic of this post is the following profiler output. GetSliceFromKey takes over 6% of our performance, or about 24.5 seconds out of the total run. That kinda sucks.  What is the purpose of this function? Well, RavenDB&#x2019;s document ids are case insensitive, so we need to convert the key to lower case and then do a search on our internal index. That has quite a big cost associated with it. And yes, we are aware of the pain. Luckily, we are already working with highly optimized codebase, so we aren&#x2019;t seeing this function dominate our costs, but still&#x2026; Here is the breakdown of this code:   As you can see, over 60% of this function is spent in just converting to lower case, which sucks. Now, we have some additional knowledge about this function. For the vast majority of cases, we know that this function will handle only ASCII characters, and that Unicode document ids are possible, but relatively rare. We can utilize this knowledge to optimize this method. Here is what this will look like, in code:  Basically, we scan through the string, and if there is a character whose value is over 127 we fall to the slower method (slower being relative, that is still a string conversion in less than 25 &#x3BC;s). Then we just find if a character is in the upper case range and convert it to lower case (ASCII bit analysis is funny, it was intentionally designed to be used with bit masking, and all sort of tricks are possible there) and store it in the buffer, or just store the original value.  The result?  This method went from taking 5.89% to taking just 0.6%, and we saved over 22 seconds(!) in the run. Again, this is under the profiler, and the code is heavily multi threaded. In practice, this means that the run took 3 seconds less.  Either way, we are still doing pretty good, and we don&#x2019;t have that pile of poo, so I  we&#x2019;re good.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We focused on opening the transaction, but we also have the context management to deal with, in this case, we have: And you can see that it cost us over 11.5% of the total request time. When we started this optimization phase, by the way, it took about 14% of the request time, so along the way our previous optimizations has also helped us to reduce it from 42 &#x3BC;s to just 35 &#x3BC;s.  Drilling into this, it become clear what is going on:   The problem is that on each context release we will dispose the ByteStringContext, and on each operation allocation we&#x2019;ll create a new one. That was done as part of performance work aimed at reducing memory utilization, and it looks like we were too aggressive there. We do want to keep those ByteStringContext around if we are going to immediately use them, after all. I changed it so the actual disposal will only happen when the context is using fragmented memory, and the results were nice.   This is a much nicer profiler output to look at, to be frank. Overall, we took the random reads scenario and moved it from million reads in 342 seconds (under the profiler) to 264 seconds (under the profiler). Note that those times are cumulative, since we run that in multiple threads, the actual clock time for this (in the profiler) is just over a minute. And that just leave us with the big silent doozy of GetDocumentsById, which now takes a whooping 77% of the request time.</p>
