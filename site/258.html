            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m reading MongoDB in Action right now. It is an interesting book and I wanted to learn more about the approach to using MongoDB, rather then just be familiar with the feature set and what it can do. But this post isn&#x2019;t about the book, it is about something that I read, and as I was reading it I couldn&#x2019;t help but put down the book and actually think it through.More specifically, I&#x2019;m talking about this little guy. This is a small Ruby class that was presented in the book as part of an inventory management system. In particular, this piece of code is supposed to allow you to sell limited inventory items and ensure that you won&#x2019;t sell stuff that you don&#x2019;t have. The example is that if you have 10 rakes in the stores, you can only sell 10 rakes. The approach that is taken is quite nice, by simulating the notion of having a document per each of the rakes in the store and allowing users to place them in their cart. In this manner, you prevent the possibility of a selling more than you actually have.What I take strong issue with is the way this is implemented. MongoDB doesn&#x2019;t have multi document transactions, but the solution presented requires it. Therefor, the approach outlined in the book is to try to build transactional semantics from the client side. I write databases for a living, and I find that concept utterly baffling. Clients shouldn&#x2019;t try to do stuff like that, not only would they most likely get it wrong, but they&#x2019;ll do that extremely inefficiently.Let us consider the following tidbit of code:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.&#xA;      Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;              Show hidden characters&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;           @fetcher.add_to_cart(@order_id, &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;               {:sku =&gt; &quot;ball&quot;, :qty =&gt; 3},&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;               {:sku =&gt; &quot;glove&quot;, :qty =&gt; 1})&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          add_to_cart.rb&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;The idea here is that the fetcher is supposed to be able to atomically add the products to the order. If there aren&#x2019;t enough available products to be added, the entire thing is supposed to be rolled back. As a business operation, this make a lot of sense.

That little add_to_cart call that we had earlier resulted in no less than eight network roundtrips. That is in the happy case.&#xA0; There is also the failure mode to consider, which involved resetting all the work done so far. The thing that really bothers me is that I can&#x2019;t believe that this is something that you&#x2019;ll actually want to do except as an intellectual exercise. I mean, sure, how we can pretend to get transactions from non transactional store is interesting, but given the costs of doing this or the possibility of failure or the fact that this is a non atomic state transition or&#x2026; you get my point, right?In the case of this code, the whole process is non atomic. That means that outside observers can see the changes as they are happening. It also opens you up for a lot of Bad Stuff in terms of abusing the system. If the user is malicious, they can use the fact that this &#x201C;transaction&#x201D; is going to be running back and forth to the database (and thus taking a lot of time) and just open another tab to initiate an action while this is going on, resulting in operations on invalid state. In the example that the book give, we can use that to force purchases of invalid items. If you think that this is unrealistic, consider this page, which talks about doing things like making money appear from thin air using just this sort of approaches.Another thing that really bugged me about this code is that it has &#x201C;error handling&#x201D; I use that in quotes because it is like a security blanket for a 2 years old. Having it there might calm things up, but it doesn&#x2019;t actually change anything. In particular, this kind of error handling looks right, but it is horribly broken if you consider what kind of actual errors can happen here. If the process running this code failed for any reason, the &#x201C;transaction&#x201D; is going to stay in an invalid state. It is possible that one of your rake will just disappear into thin air, as a result. It is supposed to be in someone&#x2019;s cart, but it isn&#x2019;t.&#xA0; The same can be the case if the server had an issue midway or just a regular network hiccup. I&#x2019;m aware that this is code that was written explicitly to be readable and easy to explain, rather then be able to withstand the vagaries of production, but still, this is a very dangerous thing to do. As an aside, not quite related to the topic of this post, but one thing that really bugged me in the book so far is the number of remote requests that are commonly required to do things. Is there an assumption that the database in question is nearby or very cheap to access, because the entire design philosophy I use is to assume that going over the network is expensive, so let us give the users a lot of ways to reduce that cost. In contrast, at least in the book, there is a lot of stuff that is just making remote calls like there is a fire sale that will close in 5 minutes. To be fair to the book, it notes that there is a possibility of failure here and explain how to handle one part of it (it missed the error conditions in the error handling) and call this out explicitly as something that should be done with consideration.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">During code review I run into these two sections, which raised a flag. Can you tell why?The problem with this type of code is two fold. First, we add optional parameters, to reduce the number of breaking changes we have. The problem with that is that we already have parameters on the call, and eventually you&#x2019;ll get to something like this:Which is the queen of optional parameters method, and you can probably guess how it looks internally. In the first case, we can add the new optional parameter to the&#x2026; options variable that we are already sending this method. This way, we don&#x2019;t have to worry about breaking changes, and we already have a way to setup options, determine defaults, etc.In the second case, we are passing two bools to the method, and there isn&#x2019;t a preexisting parameters object. Instead of creating one, we can use a Flags enum, whose bits we can set to determine what exactly the behavior of this method should be. That is generally much easier to maintain in the long run.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The RavenDB 4.0 book is going really well, this week I have managed to write about 20,000 words and the current page count is at 166. At this rate, it is going to turn into a monster in terms of how big it is going to be.The book so far covers the client API, how to model data in a document database and how to use batch processing in RavenDB with subscriptions. The full drafts are available here, and I would really appreciate any feedback you have. Next topic is to start talking about clustering and this is going to be real fun.I&#x2019;m also looking for a technical editor for the book. Someone who can both tell me that I missed a semi column in a code listing and tell me why my phrasing / spelling / grammar is poor (and likely all three at once and some other stuff that I don&#x2019;t even know). If you know someone, or better yet, interested and capable, send me a line.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into the following in a PR I recently reviewed. Take a look and try to figure out why I&#x2019;m pointing this bits out:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Those are bad errors. In the sense that they are hiding information. Sure, in 90% of the cases the user just put it the backup location or the restore location, so they know what the application is referring to. But the other 10% is looking at the exception from the logs, having &#x201C;I got an error&#x201D; support call or all sort of weird stuff.&#xA;In particular, one of the most annoying things is when the user and the application disagree on a relative path. If the user believes that the relative path is based on one location and the application another, hilarity ensues. But not in a fun way.&#xA;A better way to prevent all of those would be to just include the actual locations (fully resolved, mind) in the error. It doesn&#x2019;t prevent support calls, but it does make them a lot easier to solve.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After the last three parts, I think that I have a good high level understanding of what is going on in the Noise codebase, as a reminder, I&#x2019;m reviewing 48d808375e541eca383826ea928272976bce064d.I love reading code, especially stuff that I&#x2019;m not familiar with, such as a new platform or doing something novel. The Noise codebase is quite interesting, and it is a very early stage in the project. That said, when looking at what it is doing and comparing to what I&#x2019;m doing in my day job, a few things popped up.I couldn&#x2019;t help but think that this is a very similar model to the default Azure DocumentDB. All the data is indexed, and the values are shredded as they go in. The model you use was very similar. The nice thing about this kind of model is that it gives you a lot of freedom and flexibility, but the downside is that if you need more, there aren&#x2019;t any alternatives. Storing large JSON documents inside Noise is likely to cause problems, especially if you are typically working with the full document. If you are just throwing things into it and then pulling back pieces, especially if the documents you write are relatively small, this is likely to be much more suited. Noise is making some clever usage of the LSM nature of RocksDB to do cleanups, and I really like the elegance of the indexing engine. The query model is also interesting, in that it gives you a lot of freedom to operate. Select the right fields, define the appropriate aggregation, etc. But queries are limited (no computation) and aggregation queries are going to run with cost of O(N) with respect to their results. Given that this is intended to be embedded, and apparently into low end devices, that might very well be the right decision.A side affect of the shredding is that you need to reconstruct documents all the time, since they were broken into component parts. Things like scanning results by one field while returning another looks like they can generate O(N * log N) number of queries in RocksDB. I&#x2019;m not sure how much that can scale with regards to queries. On the one hand, there are very clear layers between the pieces of the code, which is great, but that also have some built in issues with regards to how much performance you can squeeze out of the system. I don&#x2019;t have a feeling for Rust code performance, nor do I think that the project is ready at this early stage for performance analysis, but it is a concern. Then again, I did just spent the past two years head down in a major performance work, so that might very well be the reason. And it is entirely possible that the code will perform significantly better when the project is done.One last thing to note, when I tried building a replacement to Lucene one of the annoying thing to pop up was that it is really hard to replace Lucene efficiently and still be better in term of time / space / complexity. Noise in particular is storing all the data at least twice (once as terms to be searched, once as the actual document data). This make is very easy to do certain operations (such as update a document), but it also means that the cost of updating a document is now doubled. We first need to index the new document, then we need to re-index old document, compare between the two and then write the changes. I guess that it is possible that reducing the amount work to be written would help matters, but the cost of indexing is likely to dominate. I would expect a Noise index to be significantly larger than the Lucene equivalent, because Lucene does a lot to reduce file size (in quite evil &amp; nasty ways, to be fair). Another thing that I don&#x2019;t think that is good is the reliance on a query language in an embedded solution. A much better idea in my option would be to expose the raw documents out and let the client handle it. If it is running in the same memory space, there is no extra cost. This is because the moment that this open up a huge number of features / issues. I&#x2019;m talking specifically about the notion of &#x201C;return&#x201D; here. The idea is really cool, you can project exactly what you want from the document, and that allows the engine to only pull the relevant data.At any rate, this is really getting late now, so I&#x2019;ll close with the note that Noise is a really cool codebase to read. Even if you don&#x2019;t know Rust, going ahead and reading something non trivial is a really good exercise in learning new things. And I&#x2019;m really interested in what Noise is going to do next.</p>
