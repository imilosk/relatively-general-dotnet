            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Linq for NHibernate is not part of the 2.0 release. Linq support is planned for the 2.1 release. That said, we have been getting a lot of questions about that.   The technical reasons are not really interesting, but suffice to say that to provide good Linq support we also need to modify NHibernate slightly. Those changes happens on the trunk, which is what Linq for NHibernate is following.  However, due to all the questions that we got, I wanted to point out that Daniel Guenter has back ported the current version of Linq to NHibernate to Nhibernate 2.0 and made it available here.  Now, the disclaimer. We are not supporting this. This is an unofficial (but welcome) contribution from the community. It is likely to have bugs (in fact, we know it contains bug in the more complex Linq queries, that is why it is still under active development), and the NHibernate team response is most likely going to be, use the latest, which requires the NHibernate trunk, not the NHibernate 2.0 version.  Use at your own risk, etc.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A while ago I talked about persistent DSL caching. I was asked why my solution was not a builtin part of Rhino DSL.   The reason for that is that this is actually a not so simple problem. Let me point out a few of the issues that are non obvious.     Need to handle removal of scripts    Need to handle updating scripts    Need to handle new scripts   Those are easy, sort of, but what about this one?     Need to handle DSL updates   When you are in development mode, you really need to know that changing the way the DSL behaves would also invalidate any cache.  I like to keep a very high bar of quality on the software I make, and there is a fine distinction between one off attempts and reusable ones. One off attempts can be hackish and stupid. Reusable implementations should be written properly.  And no, there isn&#x27;t anything overly complex here. Just time to test all bases.  Anyone feels like sumbiting a patch?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to impress me. All you have to do is show me something that I didn&#x27;t think about, or do something that I consider difficult and valuable. If it is just difficult, it is not really interesting, and if it is valuable but obvious, it is not really impressive. If it is not valuable, there is no point in spending any time on it.  It seems like common sense, to me. But I had four different occasions recently where I was shown things where I got the strong impression that I was supposed to be impressed. I wasn&#x27;t. I really wasn&#x27;t, in a few cases.  In two cases, it was doing things in the really hard way, and I was able to point out easier ways to approach the problem. One was just not interesting to me and in the case of the last two, I kept asking, &quot;and... ?&quot;, trying to figure out exactly why I was supposed to be impressed. Both were a duplication of existing work, and I couldn&#x27;t figure out what new there.   Oh, there were new things, but none of them was something that couldn&#x27;t be built in less than a day or two. So they didn&#x27;t pass the difficult bar.  If you want people to be impressed, you have better do something impressive. Sorry, but I have hard time of getting excited of Yet Another Xyz or Overcomplicated Solution Abc.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I said that I would post about it, so here is the high level design for generic implementation of natural language looking parsing. Let us explore the problem scenario first. We want to be able to build this language, without having to build a full blown language from scratch:     open http://www.ayende.com/     click on link to Blog       click on link to first post      enter comment with name Ayende Rahien and email foo@example.org and url http://www.ayende.com/Blog/      enter comment text This is an awesome post.      click on submit      comment with This is an awesome post should appear on page   And to prove that we are not focusing on a single language, let us try this one as well:     when account balance is 500$ and withdrawal is made of 400$ we should get a low funds alert     when account balance is 500$ and withdrawal is made of 501$ we should deny the transaction      when weekly international charge is at 3,500$ and max weekly international charge is of 5,000$ and new charge arrives for amount 2,230$ we should deny the transaction   I think that those are divergent enough to show that the solution is a generic one.  And now, to the solution. Each type of language is going to have its own DSL engine, which know how to deal with the particular dialect that we are using. The default parsing is a three steps solution. First, split the text into sentences, then, split each sentence to tokens by whitespace. Now, for each statement, we search for the appropriate statement resolve, which is a class that knows how to deal with it. The statement resolver methods are then called to process the statement.  There are two key principal to the design. First, turning something like &#x27;click on link&#x27; to an invocation of the ClickOnLink statement resolver and lazy parameter evaluation.  This is going to be interesting, the time right now is 19:38, and I am going to start implementing this.   It is now 22:04, and I finished the first language.   Working on the second now. It is 22:10 and I am done with the second one.  What did I do?   I took the text we had and turn that into executable commands. Now, this isn&#x27;t flexible at all. If you make a modification in the way it is structured, it will fail, coming back to why natural language is a bad choice here, but it had quite a bit of flexibility in it.  You can get the code for this, including tests, here: https://rhino-tools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rhino-tools/experiments/natrual-language  But let us talk for a bit about how this is implemented. I&#x27;ll show the bank example, because it is easier.  We start by defining the BankParser, which looks like this:     The bank parser merely define what the statement resolvers are, and any special parsers that are needed (in this case, we need to handle dollar values).  A statement parser is trivial:     &#xA0;  And yes, those are pure POCO classes.  The whole idea here was that I can implement some smarts into the default engine about how it recognize methods and resolve parameters. I will admit that overloading caused some issues, but I think that this is pretty simple implementation.  It also does a good job in demonstrating the problems in such a language. Go ahead and try to build operator precedence into it. Or implement an if statement. You really can&#x27;t, not without introducing a lot more structure into it. And that would turn it into yet another programming language.  What about the tooling? Intellisense and syntax highlighting?  Well, since we have the structure of the code, and we know the conventions, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem taking my previous posts about this and translating them directly into supporting this.  And yes, I can create a language in this in a few minutes, As BankParser has proven.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeremy Miller is looking for a DSL that reads like natural language. My immediate response was that it is not practical, because I assumed he wanted very natural language, which is still not possible to do without extremely high budget. Limiting the problem to just reads like a natural language reduce the problem space significantly.  I am going to have a separate post about how to actually solve such a problem, but for now, I want to talk about the actual requested solution. I think it is 100%solvable with a low cost approach. That is, you can get a DSL that reads like English in under an hour. But I don&#x27;t think it is valuable.  English is a terrible language to express instructions in. Any natural language is terrible in expressing instructions, just find the nearest army sergeant, they will tell you that.  Let us take a look at a language that actually took this approach:     tell application &quot;Finder&quot;      set the percent_free to &#xAC;&#xA;      (((the free space of the startup disk) / (the capacity of the startup disk)) * 100) div 1    end tell&#xA;    if the percent_free is less than 10 then&#xA;  tell application (path to frontmost application as text)        display dialog &quot;The startup disk has only &quot; &amp; the percent_free &amp; &#xAC;         &quot; percent of its capacity available.&quot; &amp; return &amp; return &amp; &#xAC;&#xA;      &quot;Should this script continue?&quot; with icon 1&#xA;  end tell&#xA;end if&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is apple script. From my point of view, this is horrible. It is unreadable in the extreme. More than that, trying to explain how this language works, or how it handles error is a non trivial task.&#xA;&#xA;This has been my experience any time I actually tried to create a natural language like syntax. It is too complex, and users get annoyed when they can&#x27;t use real natural language.&#xA;&#xA;From my perspective, getting an expressive DSL does not means that it has to read like an English statement. In fact, it probably shouldn&#x27;t. Too much noise involved. A structured approach isn&#x27;t just to help the compiler, but to help the reader.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is strongly related to my posts about Tools Matter. During the last six months had several conversations with people about their Xyz processes. In several cases, my response was a polite version of: &quot;This Is Broken, Badly&quot; and &quot;You should automate this part&quot;.  I am a great believer in automating just about everything that move (and if it doesn&#x27;t move, kick it until it does!). In those conversation, the response was usually, &quot;Yeah, we thought about doing that, but Abc does things in a way I don&#x27;t like and Efg isn&#x27;t compatible with our Foo requirements&quot;. And that was that.  Let us take deployment as good example of that. I was talking with someone about the need for automatic deployment, and he mentioned that he is waiting for a tool to come up that will also handle workflows.  I was a bit stunned by that, and inquired deeper, at which point it became clear that the guy was working in a highly regulated environment and doing a deployment involved multiple people authorizing it in different environments before it could go live. Because of all the manual work that already exists there, which cannot be changed for regulatory reasons, they have no automated deployment.      Note, it sounds much worse than it actually is, now that I re-read this.    I was critical on this approach, for several reasons. First, even if you can&#x27;t go all the way, just having a build script that you have to manually run is a huge improvement. Next, I asked several additional questions bout the scenario, and it turned out that the process was something like this:     We need to push something to production    We deploy to a test server and ask QA to test that    Once QA sign off this release, deploy to a staging server    Get at least three business experts to smoke test the system    Once we have 3 signatures that authorize the system, we can ask Joe (the friendly IT admin) to deploy to production    Joe schedule a time for deployment and get signoff for that from someone with the authorization to do so.    At the specified time, Joe is going to deploy to production, the dev team is on call for issues there   This isn&#x27;t a good going-to-production scenario, with multiple check points to ensure that we are safe &amp; sound. The real reason is not to actually ensure quality, of course, it is to satisfy some dry regulation and have an audit trail that you can point to. But that is beside the point and shows my utter annoyance with all forms of bureaucracy.   Okay, so we have this process that we must go through in order to get something to production. There is no tool out there that will do it for us and give us the required audit trail. Therefor, we can&#x27;t use automatic deployments.  My response for that was rude and unprintable.  Here is the deal, let us estimate the cost of building such a system:     A page into which I can enter request to go to production. This consists of two text boxes and a submit button. On submit:         Automatically deploy to the test server      Send an email to me and the QA department that we have something that they need to test      Record that I have started a deployment process        A page into which the QA department can say if they authorize the build or not. On submit:         If not:             record this fact        email to dev team           If yes             Record this fact        Automatically deploy to staging server        Email all the people that can approve a build and ask them to evaluate the build            A page into which the business experts can authorize or block a build. On submit:         If not:             record the reason        email to dev team and QA           If yes:             Record this fact        If this is the third person to authorize this build (and if there are no blocks):                 record this fact          Send email to Joe, asking him to setup time for deployment                   A page for Joe to enter time for going to production, on Submit:         record this fact      Send email to whoever it is that can authorize production downtime      Generate deployment package (which Joe will run in production)       A page for authorizing scheduled downtime:         Record this fact      Email Joe that the time is approved      Email whoever is interested that there will be scheduled downtime at that time      Five pages, more or less. And yes, I am glossing over things, I know. That is not the point.  If it takes over a week to build this I would be very surprised. The benefit is that we have a more streamlined process, we no longer have to babysit multiple manual deployments and Joe doesn&#x27;t get some word document with instruction as to how to deploy. He gets a deployment package that he can copy to production and double click in order to deploy this.  Let us take another scenario. Deploying to production often fails because of one problem or the other, usually the IT admins who performed the install gave bad values to the build script. (Such as specifying the wrong connection string, or have a typo in some URL, or something of this nature). The second time that this has happened, it should be caught by the build script itself. The response I got when I expressed this opinion was that they had no control over the build process, that it was entirely the realm of the IT administrators.  Let us take the most difficult scenario that I can think of. We are required to hand to the IT admins the compiled binaries along with a document that specify what new values we should put in the configuration.  My approach for this would be to put an if statement in the application startup, which will perform a full environment check (the idea was stolen from Jeremy Miller and Release It!, by the way) and give a detailed error message. Since this is likely to be a long process, it will disable itself the first time it passes successfully (I leave the how as an exercise for the reader, consider that it should be reset the next time we deploy).  The tool to do that is code, your code. Which you built in order to provide you with the foundation for your project.  In short, because I have another half dozen examples that are as applicable, remember, you are a developer. If your tools doesn&#x27;t provide you with what you need, you can build it. And since you are not going to try to build a generic tool, the cost of doing it is extremely low.  It doesn&#x27;t even have to be a tool, just create a console application that does something, where you hard code everything. Let the compiler be your tool, and &quot;configure&quot; it with code.  Don&#x27;t wait, act.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you don&#x27;t have an automated deployment, it generally means that you are in a bad position. By automated, I mean that you should be able to push a new version out by double clicking something. If you can&#x27;t get automated deployment script in under an hour, you most certainly have a problem.  Sometimes, the problem is with the process, you don&#x27;t have the facilities to do an automated deployment because parts of the deployment is sitting in people&#x27;s head (oh, you need to configure IIS to use Xyz with the new version), in other cases, it isn&#x27;t there simply because people haven&#x27;t tried.  Yet, automated deployment is one of those things that you can create in isolation, without getting commitment or support from the rest of the team. This is usually the first thing that I do in any project with existing codebase that I come to.  It is also a good way of taking care of problems in the process. If you have a hard time deploying because you database change management process is broken, you need to fix that before you can get an automatic deployment ready.  Also, notice that I am explicitly talking about automated deployment, not about having a build script. One of the requirements for automated deployment is a build script, but that is just one of them.  I don&#x27;t care that you can or can&#x27;t build the software, I care that you can deploy this successfully. And yes, this include doing things like deploying to several machines, stopping and starting services, updating the database schema and applying any data migration processes, and even doing rolling update, if this is a requirement.  Remember, automated.  And I&#x27;ll leave you with just one final thought: Prayer should not be part of the steps in the deployment process.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Today I implemented refactoring support for a DSL. &#xA;Basically, it is Extract Business Condition, and it was explicitly modeled after the way R# handles Extract Variable. It even share the same shortcut, ctrl&#x2B;alt&#x2B;v. I also took a stub in implementing automatic pattern recognition, so when the system recognize a common usage pattern, it will automatically refactor it to a high level abstraction. It works, although I think that I can make it even more flexible than it is now. Now, if someone from the Resharper team is actually reading this, they would know that I am lying. There is no way of doing something of this magnitude in just one day, not even if you have an extremely helpful compiler.&#xA;And they would be right. I didn&#x27;t try to tackle a feature of this magnitude. What I did do was to find the most common scenario for this feature and nail that. I am taking this approach explicitly and deliberately. With the end result that I get to show value very rapidly. And yes, the customer is made aware of the limitations of this approach. I also tell them that they can get the feature by tomorrow, with error message if they are trying to do something that is not supported.Trying to support 100% is hard, trying to support just 20% turn out to be (not quite) easy.&#xA;&#xA;And now you get to nitpick it to death, I won&#x27;t respond for about a day, since I am just about to board a flight.</p>
