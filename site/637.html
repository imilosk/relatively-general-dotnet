            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you don&#x27;t have an automated deployment, it generally means that you are in a bad position. By automated, I mean that you should be able to push a new version out by double clicking something. If you can&#x27;t get automated deployment script in under an hour, you most certainly have a problem.  Sometimes, the problem is with the process, you don&#x27;t have the facilities to do an automated deployment because parts of the deployment is sitting in people&#x27;s head (oh, you need to configure IIS to use Xyz with the new version), in other cases, it isn&#x27;t there simply because people haven&#x27;t tried.  Yet, automated deployment is one of those things that you can create in isolation, without getting commitment or support from the rest of the team. This is usually the first thing that I do in any project with existing codebase that I come to.  It is also a good way of taking care of problems in the process. If you have a hard time deploying because you database change management process is broken, you need to fix that before you can get an automatic deployment ready.  Also, notice that I am explicitly talking about automated deployment, not about having a build script. One of the requirements for automated deployment is a build script, but that is just one of them.  I don&#x27;t care that you can or can&#x27;t build the software, I care that you can deploy this successfully. And yes, this include doing things like deploying to several machines, stopping and starting services, updating the database schema and applying any data migration processes, and even doing rolling update, if this is a requirement.  Remember, automated.  And I&#x27;ll leave you with just one final thought: Prayer should not be part of the steps in the deployment process.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Today I implemented refactoring support for a DSL. &#xA;Basically, it is Extract Business Condition, and it was explicitly modeled after the way R# handles Extract Variable. It even share the same shortcut, ctrl&#x2B;alt&#x2B;v. I also took a stub in implementing automatic pattern recognition, so when the system recognize a common usage pattern, it will automatically refactor it to a high level abstraction. It works, although I think that I can make it even more flexible than it is now. Now, if someone from the Resharper team is actually reading this, they would know that I am lying. There is no way of doing something of this magnitude in just one day, not even if you have an extremely helpful compiler.&#xA;And they would be right. I didn&#x27;t try to tackle a feature of this magnitude. What I did do was to find the most common scenario for this feature and nail that. I am taking this approach explicitly and deliberately. With the end result that I get to show value very rapidly. And yes, the customer is made aware of the limitations of this approach. I also tell them that they can get the feature by tomorrow, with error message if they are trying to do something that is not supported.Trying to support 100% is hard, trying to support just 20% turn out to be (not quite) easy.&#xA;&#xA;And now you get to nitpick it to death, I won&#x27;t respond for about a day, since I am just about to board a flight.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am going to give a workshop or two at the ALT.Net Austin in the end of October. Those will be free (as in beer) and will be recorded &amp; available on the net afterward. Right now I want to do on on writing DSLs, but I have another which is basically blank at the moment. I have too many subjects that I can talk about, and too many levels at which I can talk about them.   So, this is your chance to help me. If you are going to be there, what would you like to have a workshop about?  And no, a question like NHibernate is not acceptable, it is&#xA0; too broad. Are we talking about NHibernate best practices, high scalability, tips and tricks or advance usages. I can do a three hours workshop on any of them.   Suggestions?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The problem as it was stated was of rules that looked like this:     upon bounced_check or refused_credit:&#xA;&#x9;if customer.TotalPurchases &gt; 10000: # preferred&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ask_authorization_for_more_credit&#xA;&#x9;else:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;call_the cops &#xA;&#xA;upon new_order:&#xA;&#x9;if customer.TotalPurchases &gt; 10000: # preferred&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;apply_discount 5.precent &#xA;&#xA;upon order_shipped:&#xA;&#x9;send_marketing_stuff unless customer.RequestedNoSpam &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I don&#x27;t like it, and the reason isn&#x27;t just that we can introduce IsPreferred.&#xA;&#xA;I don&#x27;t like it because the abstraction facilities here are poor. We have basically introduced events and business rules, maybe with a sprinkling of a domain model, but nothing really meaningful. Such system will die under their own weight in any situation of significant complexity (in other words, in all real world situations).&#xA;&#xA;Let us consider the problem in reverse, shall we? We have various conditions and actions upon which we can act. But the logic is scattered all over the place, making it hard to read, modify, understand and work with. When such a system compose of the lifeblood of the business, the business usually adapts, and starts to talk in the terms of the system. However, they tend to lose the ability to think about things in way that would be more meaningful. &#xA;&#xA;I listened today to a business person trying to explain some concept that he wanted to make. It took him several tries to explain the business problem because he was focused on the technical one. The system has a corrupting affect on it. I call this the Babel Syndrome, the reverse of DDD&#x27;s ubiquitous language.&#xA;&#xA;Let us see if we can get a high level of meaning out of the above DSL, shall we? First, we restate our problem, instead of dealing with events and conditions for responding the events, we deal with business responses for scenarios. It doesn&#x27;t sound like much of a difference, but in actuality, there is a big difference between the two. &#xA;&#xA;The most important of those differences is the change from handling the events to handling a business scenario in a given context. In other words, instead of asking what we should do when a check is bounced, we need to ask a totally different question. &quot;When the customer is preferred, what should the response be for bounced check?&quot; &#xA;&#xA;This is anything but a minor change in the the way we think about the language and how we operate on it. Let us see the DSL script, after which we can discuss how it affects us. These are the contents of the default.boo file:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  upon order_shipped:&#xA;&#x9;send_marketing_stuff unless customer.RequestedNoSpam&#xA;&#xA;  upon bounced_check or refused_credit:         call_the cops&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This will be executed for all orders, like before. Now, let us look at preferred_customer.boo, and what concepts it express.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  when customer.TotalPurchases &gt; 10000 # preferred&#xA;&#xA;upon new_order:&#xA;&#x9;apply_discount 5.precents&#xA;&#xA;upon bounced_check or refused_credit:&#xA;&#x9;ask_authorization_for_more_credit&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And now we are getting to see some of the more interesting parts of the difference. We are now talking in terms of a business scenario. When we have a preferred customer, and something happen, how should we respond?&#xA;&#xA;This change is a well known refactoring: conditional to polymorphism. In other words, we just created the strategy pattern with a DSL. The difference here is that the script have an active role in deciding whatever it can deal with the scenario or not (in other words, chain of responsibility, and the pattern I am going to mention).&#xA;&#xA;When we need to handle some business scenario, we are going to execute all the scripts, with the default.boo being the last one to run. If any of the scripts accepted the scenario as valid and has specific action to take, it has the option to do so.&#xA;&#xA;Enough about the implementation, let us go back to the concepts. We can make now talk to the business people in a way that is far more concise and natural. Instead of having to focus on all permutations of a possible event, we can now talking about a specific scenario and how we handle the business event in that context. Not only is this more readable, it is easier by far to actually define such things as what is the meaning of a preferred customer. I can open the DSL and actually read it.&#xA;&#xA;Similar approaches are very useful when you recognize that the code is asking to be given a more explicit shape than just generic rules. Don&#x27;t let your DSL be whatever you started with. Find and actively extract higher level meanings whenever it is possible.&#xA;&#xA;A deeper examination of this DSL, how to build and use it is likely to compose most of chapter 13, as a real world example of a complex DSL. Who do you think?&#xA;&#xA;Given this approach, how would you design an offer management DSL?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was having a discussion today about the way business rules are implemented. And large part of the discussion was focused on trying to get a specific behavior in a specific circumstance. As usual, I am going to use a totally different example, which might not be as brutal in its focus as the real one.  We have a set of business rules that relate to what is going to happen to a customer in certain situations. For example, we might have the following:     upon bounced_check or refused_credit:&#xA;&#x9;if customer.TotalPurchases &gt; 10000: # preferred&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ask_authorizatin_for_more_credit&#xA;&#x9;else:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;call_the cops&#xA;&#xA;upon new_order:&#xA;&#x9;if customer.TotalPurchases &gt; 10000: # preferred&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;apply_discount 5.precent&#xA;&#xA;  upon order_shipped:     send_marketing_stuff unless customer.RequestedNoSpam&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;What is this code crying for? Here is a hint, it is not the introduction of IsPreferred, although that would be welcome. &#xA;&#xA;I am interested in hearing what you will have to say in this matter.&#xA;&#xA;And as a total non sequitur, cockroaches at Starbucks, yuck.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a note to myself, because I don&#x27;t have the time for a proper post. When you are dealing with a DSL that contains more than just a few scripts, you really being to care about compilation times. Even with caching, this can be a problem.  The solution is the same that we have been using for the last three to four decades, don&#x27;t compile if the source hasn&#x27;t changed.  The code to make this happen using Rhino DSL is here:     public override CompilerContext Compile(string[] urls)&#xA;{&#xA;    var outputAssemblyName = OutputAssemblyName(urls);&#xA;    if (CanUseCachedVersion(outputAssemblyName, urls))&#xA;        return new CompilerContext { GeneratedAssembly = Assembly.Load(File.ReadAllBytes(outputAssemblyName)) };&#xA;    return base.Compile(urls);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;private bool CanUseCachedVersion(string outputAssemblyName, string[] urls)&#xA;{&#xA;    var asm = new FileInfo(outputAssemblyName);&#xA;    if(asm.Exists==false)&#xA;        return false;&#xA;    foreach (var url in urls)&#xA;    {&#xA;        if(File.GetLastWriteTime(url) &gt; asm.LastWriteTime)&#xA;            return false;&#xA;    }&#xA;    return true;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And in the CustomizeCompiler method:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  protected override void CustomizeCompiler(BooCompiler compiler, CompilerPipeline pipeline, string[] urls)&#xA;{&#xA;    compiler.Parameters.OutputAssembly = OutputAssemblyName(urls);&#xA;    // add implicit base class here...&#xA;    if (pipeline.Find(typeof(SaveAssembly)) == -1)&#xA;        pipeline.Add(new SaveAssembly());}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;It is impossible to overstate how big a difference this can make.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Probably one of the hardest challenges that I am facing with writing the book is to know what to say and what to leave unsaid.  Phrasing it another way, it is choosing at what level to talk to the reader. On the one hand, I really want the reader to be able to make immediate use of the concepts that I am talking about, which drive me to do more practical demonstrations, code samples and covering more common situations. On the other hand, those take up a lot of room, and they tend to be boring if you don&#x27;t need exactly what you need right this moment.   High level concepts, open ended possibilities and assuming a bit about the reader knowledge level makes for a book that is much more narrowly focused, and I think that it more valuable. However, it also tend to leave readers unsatisfied, because not everything is explained.  Currently I am writing a UI focused chapter, and to get a good experience from the UI you need to invest a lot of time. Metric tons of it. I am trying to chart the way and show how this can be done, but without getting mired in all the actual minute details.   This is a tough balancing act, and I am not sure if I am succeeding.</p>
