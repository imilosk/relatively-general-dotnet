            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post is in response for a few comments here. In particular, I get the sense that people expect businesses and systems to behave as if transactions are a real thing. The only problem here is that this is quite far from the truth. Let me define what I mean by a transaction here. I&#x2019;m not talking about database transactions, ACID or any such thing. I&#x2019;m talking about the notion that any interaction between a user and a business, or between two businesses can actually be modeled with the notion of a transaction similar to what we see in databases. That is, that we have an interaction that would either be all there, or won&#x2019;t be there at all. The most obvious example is the notion of financial transaction, the notion that we debit an account and then we credit another account. And we have to do that in such a way that either both accounts were modified or none of them were modified. That is the classic example for database transactions, and it is wrong. As anyone who ever wrote a check or sent an wire money transfer can tell. A good discussion on how that actually works can be found here. Note that in this case, the way money transfer works, in the real world, is that you upload a file over FTP, then wait three to five days to see if the orders your sent were rejected.  Another example is the notion of accepting an order, in a transactional manner. If I accepted your order, after verifying that I have reserved everything, and my warehouse burned down, what do I do with your order? I can hardly roll it back. To move away from businesses, let us consider doing something as unimportant as voting in a national election. Logically speaking, this is a pretty simple process. Identify the voter, record their vote, total the votes, select winner. Except that you can go back and force a re-election in a particular district if such is needed, or you might find a box of lost votes, or any of a hundred evil little things that crop up in the real world.  Any attempt to model such systems in neat transactional boxes with &#x201C;all in or none at all&#x201D; is going to break.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had a very interesting discussion with Kelly Sommers in twitter. But 140 characters isn&#x2019;t really enough to explain things. Also, it is interesting topic in general. Kelly disagreed with this post: http://www.shopify.ca/technology/14909841-kafka-producer-pipeline-for-ruby-on-rails  You can read the full discussion here. The basic premise is, there is a highly reliable distributed queue that is used to process messages, but because they didn&#x2019;t have operational experience with this, they used a local queue to store the messages sending them over the network. Kelly seems to think that this is decreasing reliability. I disagree. The underlying premise is simple, when do you consider it acceptable to lose a message. If returning an error to the client is fine, sure, go ahead and do that if you can&#x2019;t reach the cluster. But if you are currently processing a 10 million dollar order, that is going to kinda suck, and anything that you can do to reduce the chance of that happening is good. Note that key part in this statement, we can only reduce the chance of this happening, we can&#x2019;t ensure it.  One way to try that is to get a guaranteed SLA from the distributed queue. Once we have that, we can rely that it works. This seems to be what Kelly is aiming at:  And that is true, if you could rely on SLAs. Just this week we had a multi hour, multi region Azure outage. In fact, outages, include outages that violate SLAs are unfortunately common.  In fact, if we look at recent history, we have:  February 2012 &#x2013; Azure &#x2013; incorrect leap year calculation took down multiple regions. October 2012 &#x2013; AWS &#x2013; memory leak due to misconfiguration took down a single availability zone, API throttling caused other availability zones to be affected. December 2012 &#x2013; AWS &#x2013; a developer was running against production, and delete some key data, resulting in Netflix (among others) being unable to stream video. August 2013 &#x2013; Azure &#x2013; more servers brought online to increase capacity caused a misconfigured network appliance to believe that it is under attack, resulting in Azure Europe going dark. There are actually more of them, but I think that 5 outages in 2 years is enough to show a pattern. And note specifically that I&#x2019;m talking about global outages like the ones above. Most people don&#x2019;t realize that complex systems operate in a constant mode of partial failure. If you ever read an accident investigative report, you&#x2019;ll know that there is almost never just a single cause of failure. For example, the road was slippery and the driver was speeding and the ABS system failed and the road barrier foundation rotted since being installed. Even a single change in one of those would mitigate the accident from a fatal crash to didn&#x2019;t happen to a &#x201C;honey, we need a new car&#x201D;. You can try to rely on the distribute queue in this case, because it has an SLA. And Toyota also promises that your car won&#x2019;t suddenly accelerate into a wall, but if you had a Toyota Camry in 2010&#x2026; well, you know&#x2026; From my point of view, saving the data locally before sending over the network makes a lot of sense. In general, the local state of the machine is much more stable than than the network. And if there is an internal failure in the machine, it is usually too hosed to do anything about anyway. I might try to write to disk, and write to the network even if I can&#x2019;t do that ,because I want to do my utmost to not lose the message.  Now, let us consider the possible failure scenarios. I&#x2019;m starting all of them with the notion that I just got a message for a 10 million dollars order, and I need to send it to the backend for processing.  We can&#x2019;t communicate with the distributed queue. That can be because it is down, hopefully that isn&#x2019;t the case, but from our point of view, if our node became split from the network, this has the same effect. We are writing this down to disk, so when we become available again, we&#x2019;ll be able to forward the stored message to the distributed queue. We can&#x2019;t communicate with the disk, maybe it is full, or there is an error, or something like that .We can still talk to the network, so we place it in the distributed queue, and we go on with our lives. We can&#x2019;t communicate with the disk, we can&#x2019;t communicate with the network. We can&#x2019;t keep it in memory (we might overflow the memory), and anyway, if we are out of disk and network, we are probably going to be rebooted soon anyway. SOL, there is nothing else we can do at this point. Note that the first case assumes that we actually do come back up. If the admin just blew this node away, then the data on that node isn&#x2019;t coming back, obviously. But since the admin knows that we are storing things locally, s/he will at least try to restore the data from that machine. We are safer (not safe, but more safe than without it). The question is whatever this is worth it? If your messages aren&#x2019;t actually carrying financial information, you can probably just drop a few messages as long as you let the end user know about that, so they can retry. If you really care about each individual message, if it is important enough to go the extra few miles for it, then the store and forward model gives you a measurable level of extra safety.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is bloody strange. I have a test failing in our unit tests, which isn&#x2019;t an all too uncommon occurrence after a big work. The only problem is that this test shouldn&#x2019;t fail, no one touched this part. For reference, here is the commit where this is failing. You can reproduce this by running the Raven.Tryouts console project. Note that it has to be done in Release mode. When that happens, we consistently get the following error:  Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.   at Raven.Client.Connection.MultiGetOperation.&lt;TryResolveConflictOrCreateConcurrencyException&gt;d__b.MoveNext() in c:\Work\ravendb\Raven.Client.Lightweight\Connection\MultiGetOperation.cs:line 156--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)&#xA;Here is the problem with this stack trace:&#xA;&#xA;Now, this only happens in release mode, but it happens there consistently. Now, I&#x2019;ve verified that this isn&#x2019;t an issue of me running old version of the code. So this isn&#x2019;t possible. There is no concurrency going on, all the data this method is touching is only touched by this thread. &#xA;What is more, the exception is not thrown from inside the foreach loop in line 139. I&#x2019;ve verified that by putting a try catch around the inside of the loop and still getting the NRE when thrown outside it. In fact, I have tried to figure it out in pretty much any way I can. Attaching a debugger make the problem disappear, as does disabling optimization, or anything like that.&#xA;In fact, at this point I&#x2019;m going to throw up my hands in disgust, because this is not something that I can figure out. Here is why, this is my &#x201C;fix&#x201D; for this issue. I replaced the following failing code:&#xA;&#xA;With the following passing code:&#xA;&#xA;And yes, this should make zero difference to the actual behavior, but it does. I&#x2019;m suspecting a JIT issue.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We are pretty much done with RavenDB 3.0, we are waiting for fixes to internal apps we use to process orders and support customers, and then we can actually make a release. In the meantime, that means that we need to start looking beyond the 3.0 release. We had a few people internally focus on post 3.0 work for the past few months, and we have a rough outline for what we done there. Primarily we are talking about better distribution and storage models.  Storage models &#x2013; the polyglot database Under this umbrella we put dedicated database engines to support specific needs. We are talking about distributed counters (high scale out, rapid throughput), time series and event store as the primary areas that we are focused on. For example, the counters stuff is pretty much complete, but we didn&#x2019;t have time to actually make that into a fully mature product. I talked about this several times in the past, so I&#x2019;ll not get into too many details here. Distribution models We have been working on a Raft implementation for the past few months, and it is now in the stage where we are starting to integrate it into the rest of our software. Raft is planned to be the core replication protocol for the time series and events databases. But you are probably going to see if first as topology super layer for RavenDB and RavenFS. Distributed topology management Replication support in RavenDB and RavenFS follow the multi master system. You can write to any node, and your write will be distributed by the server to all the nodes. This has several advantages, in particular, the fact that we can operate in disconnected or partially disconnected manner, and that we need little coordination between clients to get everything working. It also has the disadvantage of allow conflicts. In fact, if you are writing to multiple replicating nodes, and aren&#x2019;t careful about how you are splitting writes, you are pretty much guaranteed to have conflicts. We have repeatedly heard that this is both a good thing and something that customers really don&#x2019;t want to deal with.  It is a good thing because we don&#x2019;t have data loss, it is a bad thing because if you aren&#x2019;t ready to handle this, some of your data is inaccessible because of the conflict until it is resolved.  Because of that, we are considering implementing a server side topology management system. The actual replication mechanics are going to remain the same. But the difference is how we are going to decide how to work with it. A cluster (in this case, a set of RavenDB servers and all databases and file systems on them)&#xA0; is composed of cooperating nodes. The cluster is managed via Raft, which is used to store the topology information of the cluster. Topology include each of the nodes in the system, as well as any of the databases and file systems on the cluster. The cluster will select a leader, and that leader will also be the primary node for writes for all databases. In other words, assume we have a 3 node cluster, and 5 databases in the cluster. All the databases are replicated to all three nodes, and a single node is going to serve as the write primary for all operations. During normal operations, clients will query any server for the replication topology (and cache that) every 5 minutes or so. If a node is down, we&#x2019;ll switch over to an alternative node. If the leader is down, we&#x2019;ll query all other nodes to try to find out who the new leader is, then continue using that leader&#x2019;s topology from now on. This give us the advantage that a down server cause clients to switch over and stay switched. That avoid an operational hazard when you bring a down node back up again. Clients will include the topology version they have in all communication with the server. If the topology version doesn&#x2019;t match, the server will return an error, and the client will query all nodes it knows about to find the current topology version. It will always chose the latest topology version, and continue from there. Note that there are still a chance for conflicts, a leader may become disconnected from the network, but not be aware of that, and accept writes to the database. Another node will take over as the cluster leader and clients will start writing to it. There is a gap where a conflict can occur, but it is pretty small one, and we have good mechanisms to deal with conflicts, anyway. We are also thinking about exposing a system similar to the topology for clients directly. Basically, a small distributed and consistent key/value store. Mostly meant for configuration. Thoughts?</p>

I intended it to be a demo packed 60 minutes, but then I realized that I only have 40 minutes for the entire thing. The only thing to do was to speed things out, I think I breathed twice throughout the entire presentation. And I think it went great.  RAVENDB: WOW!

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So far we tackled the idea of large compute cluster, and a large storage cluster. I mentioned that the problem with the large storage cluster is that it doesn&#x2019;t handle consistency within itself. Two concurrent requests can hit two storage nodes and make concurrent operations that aren&#x2019;t synchronized between themselves. That is usually a good thing, since that is what you want for high throughput system. The less coordination you can get away with, the more you can actually do. So far, so good, but that isn&#x2019;t always suitable. Let us consider a case where we need to have a consistent approach, for some business reason. The typical example would be transactions in a bank, but I hate this example, because in the real world banks deal with inconsistency all the time, this is an explicit part of their business model. Let us talk about auctions and bids, instead. We have an auction service, which allow us to run a large number of auctions.  For each auction, users can place bids, and it is important for us that bids are always processed sequentially per auction, because we have to know who place a bid that is immediately rejected ($1 commission) or a wining bid that was later overbid (no commission except for the actual winner). We&#x2019;ll leave aside the fact that this is something that we can absolutely figure out from the auction history and say that we need to have it immediate and consistent. How do we go about doing this? Remember, we have enough load on the system that we are running a cluster with a hundred nodes in it. The rough topology is still this:  We have the consensus cluster, which decide on the network topology. In other words, it decide which set of servers is responsible for which auction. What happens next is where it gets interesting. Instead of just a set of cooperating nodes that share the data between them and each of which can accept both reads and writes, we are going to twist things a bit. Each set of servers is their own consensus cluster for that particular auction. In other words, we first go to the root consensus cluster to get the topology information, then we add another command to the auction&#x2019;s log. That command go through the same distributed consensus algorithm between the three nodes. The overall cluster is composed of many consensus clusters for each auction.  This means that we have a fully consistent set of operations across the entire cluster, even in the presence of failure. Which is quite nice. The problem here is that you have to have a good way to distinguish between the different consensuses. In this case, an auction is the key per consensus, but it isn&#x2019;t always so each to make such distinction, and it is important that an auction cannot grow large enough to overwhelm the set of servers that it is actually using. In those cases, you can&#x2019;t really do much beyond relax the constraints and go in a different manner. For optimization purposes, you usually don&#x2019;t run an independent consensus for each of the auctions. Or rather, you do, but you make sure that you&#x2019;ll share the same communication resources, so for auctions/123 the nodes are D,E,U with E being the leader, while for auctions/321 the nodes are also D,E,U but U is the leader. This gives you the ability to spread processing power among the cluster, and the communication channels (TCP connections, for example) are shared between both auctions consensuses.</p>
