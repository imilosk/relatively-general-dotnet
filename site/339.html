            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was listening to the Programming Touchdown podcast, and on Episode 43, around the 13:00 minute mark, there was the following quote:  I can count on one, maybe two hands, the number of times in my entire career where I need to use&#x2026; like the algorithm I used made an impactful difference. Most of the time, it doesn&#x2019;t matter, architecture can matter, sometimes. Like, true, textbook algorithms. This is roughly what it felt like to hear this&#x2026;  I mean, seriously! Okay, I write database engines for a living. Part of my job is to look at academic literature to see if there are good ways to improve what we are doing. But you know what, let us say that building database engines is something special, and that your regular web developer doesn&#x2019;t need any of it. Let us see how right that is, shall we? I&#x2019;m going to use The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth as an example here, because that certain match the definition of a text book. Reading just the table of contents:  Data structure - Stack, Queues, Linked Lists, Arrays, Binary Trees. Concepts: Co-routines (async in C#, promises in JS, etc), Random Numbers, how floating points number actually work. Sorting algorithms, searching sorted &amp; unsorted data. Saying that algorithms don&#x2019;t matter is about taking decades of research and throwing it down the tube, because the machine is powerful enough for me to not notice that I&#x2019;m brute forcing a solution at O(N**2)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post, I discussed a potential implementation for a buffer pool, and commented that it would cause issues if we had particular usage patterns. As a reminder, here is the code:     [ThreadStatic] private static Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;[] _buffersBySize;&#xA;&#xA;    private static byte[] GetBuffer(int requestedSize)&#xA;    {&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize == null)&#xA;            _buffersBySize = new Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;[32];&#xA;&#xA;        var actualSize = PowerOfTwo(requestedSize);&#xA;        var pos = MostSignificantBit(actualSize);&#xA;&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize[pos] == null)&#xA;            _buffersBySize[pos] = new Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize[pos].Count == 0)&#xA;            return new byte[actualSize];&#xA;&#xA;        return _buffersBySize[pos].Pop();&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    private static void ReturnBuffer(byte[] buffer)&#xA;    {&#xA;        var actualSize = PowerOfTwo(buffer.Length);&#xA;        if(actualSize != buffer.Length)&#xA;            return; // can&#x27;t put a buffer of strange size here (probably an error)&#xA;&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize == null)&#xA;            _buffersBySize = new Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;[32];&#xA;&#xA;        var pos = MostSignificantBit(actualSize);&#xA;&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize[pos] == null)&#xA;            _buffersBySize[pos] = new Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        _buffersBySize[pos].Push(buffer);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Now, consider a user who uses this buffer pool, but for some reason decided to move most of the disposal code to a dedicated thread. This can happen when using large files, where disposing of the file stream can take a very long time ( flushing OS buffers, etc). I have seen several places where people had a dedicated disposal threads.&#xA;What would happen in such a scenario?&#xA;Well, we would allocate buffers in threads #1 &#x2013; #10, and only return them to the buffer pool on thread #12. That would mean that we would keep allocating new buffers, but all the buffered that were returned to the pool would actually go and sit in the threads that are just releasing them. Welcome memory leak .</p>

[ThreadStatic] private static Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;[] _buffersBySize;&#xA;&#xA;    private static byte[] GetBuffer(int requestedSize)&#xA;    {&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize == null)&#xA;            _buffersBySize = new Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;[32];&#xA;&#xA;        var actualSize = PowerOfTwo(requestedSize);&#xA;        var pos = MostSignificantBit(actualSize);&#xA;&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize[pos] == null)&#xA;            _buffersBySize[pos] = new Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize[pos].Count == 0)&#xA;            return new byte[actualSize];&#xA;&#xA;        return _buffersBySize[pos].Pop();&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    private static void ReturnBuffer(byte[] buffer)&#xA;    {&#xA;        var actualSize = PowerOfTwo(buffer.Length);&#xA;        if(actualSize != buffer.Length)&#xA;            return; // can&#x27;t put a buffer of strange size here (probably an error)&#xA;&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize == null)&#xA;            _buffersBySize = new Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;[32];&#xA;&#xA;        var pos = MostSignificantBit(actualSize);&#xA;&#xA;        if(_buffersBySize[pos] == null)&#xA;            _buffersBySize[pos] = new Stack&lt;byte[]&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;        _buffersBySize[pos].Push(buffer);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;There are a couple of interesting things going on here. First, we do allocations by power of two number, this reduce the number of different sizes we have to deal with. We store all of that in a small array (using the most significant bit to index into the array based on the requested size) that contains stacks for all the requested sizes.&#xA;In practice, most of the time we&#x2019;ll use a very small number of sizes, typically 4KB &#x2013; 32KB.&#xA0; The basic idea is that you&#x2019;ll pull an array from the pool, and if there is a relevant one, we save allocations. If not, we allocate a new one and return it to the user.&#xA;Once we gave the user a buffer, we don&#x2019;t keep track of it. If they return it to us, this is great, if not, the GC will clean it up. This is important, because otherwise forgetting to call ReturnBuffer creates what is effectively a memory leak.&#xA;Another thing to notice is that we aren&#x2019;t requiring that the same thread will be used for getting and returning the buffer. It is fine to use one thread to get it and another to return it. This means that async code will work well with thread hopping and this buffer pool.&#xA0; We also use a stack, to try to keep the busy buffer close to the actual CPU cache.&#xA;Note that this is notepad code, so there are probably issues with it.&#xA;In fact, there is a big issue here that will only show up in particular usage patterns. Can you see it? I&#x2019;ll talk about it in my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things we learned from build high performance systems is that algorithm complexity is important for system performance, but it is (usually) easy to see.&#xA;Controlling allocations is something that you don&#x2019;t see. But it can have an even greater impact on your system. In particular, allocations require some CPU cost immediately, but the .NET framework is pretty good about keeping that small. In most cases, that require only bumping a counter value and giving you some memory. The true cost of allocations happen when you need to release that memory. GC, compactions, multiple generations, etc.&#xA;There are whole fields of study that deal with optimizing this issue. The downside of allocating a lot of memory is that you are going to pay the cost later. And that figuring out what exactly allocated that memory can often be quite hard. Especially if you are trying to figure it out from a production trace.&#xA;And even with the state of the art GC and memory management subsystems, your best bet to reduce memory management pressure is to reduce the number of allocations. We are far from the first to run into this. In fact, see the guidelines to contributing to Roslyn.&#xA;With RavenDB, here are a few commit messages dealing (only) with this issue:&#xA;&#xA;The results of the performance improvements on those cannot really be overstated. In some cases, we save an allocation by just 8 or 16 bytes. But in a hot path, that means that we reduce GB of memory being allocated.&#xA;The problems with allocations is that they can be pretty well hidden, here are a code sample with hidden allocations:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;var fileNames = new List&lt;Tuple&lt;string, bool&gt;&gt;();&#xA;foreach (var file in System.IO.Directory.GetFiles(dirToCheck, &quot;*.dat&quot;))&#xA;{&#xA;    using (var fs = new FileStream(file, FileMode.Open))&#xA;    {&#xA;        uint crc = CalculateCrc(fs);&#xA;        var crcStr = File.ReadAllText(file&#x2B;&quot;.crc&quot;);&#xA;        var crcMatch = crc == int.Parse(crcStr);&#xA;        fileNames.Add(Tuple.Create&lt;string, bool&gt;(file, crcMatch));&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;We will assume that CalculateCrc does absolutely no allocations, just calling ReadByte() until the end. We&#x2019;ll further assume that there are 10,000 files in the directory.&#xA;How much memory is going to be allocated here? I&#x2019;ll freely admit that I&#x2019;ll probably miss some, but here is what I found:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The fileNames list, which will allocate (using power of 2) a total of 256KB (32,764 items total in the list below, times 8 bytes per pointer)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[4]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[8]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[16]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[32]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[64]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[128]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[256]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[512]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[1024]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[2048]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[4096]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[8192]new Tuple&lt;string,bool&gt;[16384] &lt;&#x2014;This goes in the large object heap, is is 128Kb in size&#xA;&#xA;The call to GetFiles will allocate about 0.5MB:&#xA;&#xA;It also uses a list internally, then it calls ToArray on it, so the same costs as the list, plus another 78Kb for the array. And another 128Kb buffer is in the large object heap.&#xA;Note that I didn&#x2019;t went too deep into the code, there are other allocations there, but it uses an enumerator internally (to feed the list), so I&#x2019;ll assume not allocations.&#xA;&#xA;Creating a FileStream isn&#x2019;t all that expensive, but reading from it (which is done in the CalculateCrc method) will force it to allocate a 4KB buffer. So that is 39MB right there.&#xA;File.ReadAllText is a really nice convenience method, but it uses a StreamReader internally, which has a 1Kb buffer, and that uses a FileStream, which has yet another 4Kb buffer. So another 48MB.&#xA;10,000 strings for the file names returned from GetFiles, assuming that each file name is 8.3 characters, that gives us 107Kb.&#xA;10,000 strings for the CRC values we read using ReadAllText, assuming each is also 11 characters (text value of 0x576B6624), we get another 107Kb.&#xA;Oh, and I almost forgot, we have another 10,000 strings allocated here, the file&#x2B;&#x201D;.crc&#x201D; filename, which is another 146Kb.&#xA;Finally, we have 10,000 tuples, which comes to about 90Kb.&#xA;&#xA;Overall, calling this method will allocate about 90MB(!), including several allocations that fall into the large object heap.&#xA;Note that most of those calls are done on your behalf, inside the List handling, but mostly instead the I/O routines.&#xA;It has been our experience that allocations inside various I/O routines are a really common problem, especially when you have no way to send your own buffer (which you can pool, reuse, etc). For example, there is no way to share the buffer between different FileStreams instances.&#xA;I created a Pull Request in CoreCLR for this feature. But in the meantime, profiling memory allocations (vs. just the memory used) is a great way to find such issues.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is another post on the most valuable principles in software development.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;You might have heard of a guideline saying that we should aim to achieve low coupling and high cohesion when working on a code base. In this article, I&#x2019;d like to discuss what this guideline actually means and take a look at some code samples illustrating it. I also want to draw a line between these two ideas and show the differences in them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We have just released build 3785 of RavenDB 3.0. This build has quite a bit of changes (for the full gory details, see the pull request). This release includes about 3 months of bug fixes, performance improvements and the like. We have been testing this on our own systems for a few weeks now, as well as on multiple live production sites, and the results have been nothing but encouraging.  Major changes  Voron &amp; map/reduce optimizations. We have done major work to optimize how RavenDB uses map/reduce on Voron. As a result, map/reduce performance on Voron has improved tremendously. However, this require a migration step during the first startup. If you have a large RavenDB database using Voron, and you are making heavy use of map/reduce, take into account that on first start, RavenDB will need to perform an internal migration, which can take a while.  Lucene &amp; memory allocation reduction on queries. We have drastically reduced the amount of memory that is allocated per query, and improved the performance of queries substantially.  Improvements:  Many small perf optimizations, memory allocations reductions, object pooling, etc. Drastic reduction in memory allocations on common code paths.  Better handling of buffer allocations in websockets, reduces memory fragmentation.  Better handling of Take() / Skip() inside an index.  Allow only a single index to use the fast precomputation optimization at a time (reduce memory usage if multiple medium sized indexes are changed concurrently).  Better handling of concurrent addition of multiple indexes to large databases, will now run in the same set of indexing batches, instead of each having their own.  Re-implemented memory statistics checks using native calls to avoid expensive allocations.  Provide more detailed information when an index is corrupted.  Adding endpoint for stopping / starting just reduce work.  Less aggressive changes to the batch size at scale, being more cautious gives us a bit slower perf but more stable system under load.  Optimized Voron recovery code heavily to support slow I/O systems on large databases.  Allow to mark individual databases as development / staging /production.  Better handling of Lucene file usage, using mmap to avoid all allocations when querying the indexes. Significant improvements to both memory usage and querying speeds.  Subscriptions can now start from a given etag.  Subscriptions now offer more robust handling for attempting to open an existing subscription.  Subscriptions will now send a &#x201C;no results found&#x201D; so we won&#x2019;t time out for mostly idle subscriptions.  Allow to manage scripted index scripts from code using AbstractScriptedIndexCreationTask.  Fixing replication issue with RavenFS with large number of files being modified all the time.  Track the query parse time as well, for certain queries the expensive part is parsing the query, rather than executing it. Can lock transformers for modifications now as well as indexes. Better heuristics for calculating how much memory (native &amp; managed) we are actually using. Add debug endpoint to track how much map/reduce work we still have to do. Bug Fixes:  Don&#x2019;t update a side by side index if it already exits.  Allow to update a side by side index while it is still running.  Fixing index compilation error on .NET 4.6 using &#x201C;new string[0]&#x201D;.  Fixed an NRE when the index definition was removed forcibly when using dynamic queries.  Fixed error handling during disposal causing an exception to escape thread boundary and crashing.  Fixed FIPS licensing issue on embedded dbs.  Admin logs are not capturing logs protected by IsDebugEnabled statement  Fixed a finalizer usage bug causing us to try to read from a closed handle.  Prevent corrupted index warning when creating a map-reduce index and indexing is disabled.  Preventing code from trying to use disposed internal transactions.  Installed fix - check and revoke URL reservation options when Use existing website is selected.  Properly dispose of timer instance when shutting down a database using expiration bundle.  Prevent an error loading ICSharpCode.NRefactory from killing RavenDB client startup.  When disk space is very low, stop indexing and warn about it, rather than index to full disk error (and probable index corruption).  Fixing stack trace generation in generate debug info when we have spaces in the temp path.  Moved default db locations outside of the IIS directory to avoid IIS bug causing restarts.  When out of memory, replication will back off and retry, rather than fail continuously. Better handling of deleted then created indexes and transformer replicating to sibling nodes. Fixing case sensitivity issue when returning document ids. Fixing an issue with file names in RavenFS containing #.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">While studying an issue using customer data, I noticed that indexing speed wasn&#x2019;t up to what I expected it to be. In fact, the size of the indexing batch remained roughly constant (and small), and didn&#x2019;t exhibit the usual increases as RavenDB notices that the server has a lot of work to do and the resources to do it. This was while investigating something else, but since I had to re-index that database quite a few time, I decided to investigate what was going on. The underlying issue turned out to be a configuration setup. An index was specified with a MaxNumberOfOutputsPerDocument of 55. We use this value for a few things, among them to ensure to manage the memory resulting from indexing operations. In particular, we have had some issues with indexes that output a large number of index entries per documents using more then the quota allocated to the index and generating (sometime severe) memory pressure.  Unfortunately, in this case, we had the other option. The index was configured properly, but the index didn&#x2019;t actually output multiple entries. So we ended up assuming that the index would generate a lot more memory than it would actually really use. That meant that we couldn&#x2019;t feed it larger batches, because we feared it would use too much memory&#x2026; The fix was to make effectively ignore this value. Instead of using the value assuming that the user knows what is going it, we&#x2019;ll use this value as the maximum value only, and use heuristics to figure out how much memory we should reserve for the index in question. This is a smaller example of a wider issue. The values that the system gets are user input. And they should be treated as such. This means that you need to validate them in the same sense you would validate any other input from users. In the case outlined above, the only implication was that we would index a more slowly, and weren&#x2019;t able to take full advantage of the machine resources we had available. There have been other such issues. An administrator has setup a set of range values so the min value was larger than the max value. This turned out to cause us to have no effective limit, short of an integer overflow. The end result was that we would use unbounded memory for our needs, which would work, most of the time, except when you had a big set of changes to apply and we would try to do it all at once&#x2026;  Another case was an ops guy that wanted to reduce RavenDB CPU usage, so he set the number of threads available for background work to 0. That meant that work that was queued on background threads would never complete, and the system would effectively hang. You get the drift, I assume.  Your configuration file (or however you are actually configuring things) is yet another way for your user to communicate with your application. Sure, the tone is much stricter (commanding, rather than asking), but you still need to make sure that what the user is asking you to do actually make sense. And if it doesn&#x2019;t, you need to decide what to do about it.  You can exit the process. The &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t work with you people&#x201D; mode of error handling. You can emit a warning and proceed. The &#x201C;I told you so, buster!&#x201D; motto of blame shifting. You can ignore the set value. The &#x201C;I know better than you&#x201D; school of thought. There aren&#x2019;t really good choices, especially for server applications that can&#x2019;t just show an error to the user.</p>
