            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So I gave the lecture to some guys at work (reminder, I am giving an Active Record lecture on monday at the Tapuz User Group meeting in Microsoft), and it went very well.    I found some interesting holes (NHQG doesn&#x27;t work on exe because of an annoying (and soon to be fixed) bug), and some stuff that I wasn&#x27;t sure about with regard to some of the more recent things in Active Record.    I set the database dialect to SQL 2005 by mistake and was facinated by the way NHibernate did paginated queries. I forgot how hard it is to do this in SQL Server.    For some reason, my laptop refused to replicate the display to the second LCD, but will happily work with it in a dual monitor setup, so I had to code with my head to the wall just to see what was going on. My laptop is a Thinkpad R50e, and I usually use it with a dual monitor setup, so it may be related to that.    It also run about 15 minutes over the planned time (and I can certainly see it taking 3 hours easily), but I think that I can safely cut some of the more advance stuff to deal with it.     The guys that I lectured for weren&#x27;t mainly programmers, so they actually didn&#x27;t get too much of the pain that just went away, but I still got a Wow from them when I showed them how they can use strongly typed queries.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, hopefully, some ambulance chaser lawyer will hear about this and put it into action. Here is a new way to go after spammers. Don&#x27;t try to sue them for sending spam, sue them for sexual harrasment. I mean, sending a person 5,000 emails suggesting that they can&#x27;t keep it up is got to be at least slander, isn&#x27;t it? I still carry deep emotional scars from the sex change operation photos spam.    In the US, you can sue over hot coffee that you spilt on yourself, and win. This has got to have some merit...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Do you care about perfromance? Do you want to avoid that last three weeks of intesive performance work that require you to break apart a beautiful domain model and cut wide swathes of optimization horrors into your code?The short answer to this is that developers must feel the pain, and they must feel it in very short intervals. [Please, do not use this sentence out of context].     How to do this? Setup the system so it would fail if&#xA0;a given performance objective is passed. A simple example can be to add a check to the request&#xA0;finish that verify that the amount of database queries falls beneath a pre-defined threshold*. If the page is executing more than X queries, it fails, immediately, on the developer machine, with a clear signal saying why. Take this approach to the test / QA machines as well. Make sure that when a performance issue hits, it is something that can&#x27;t be ignored, and it can be pointed directly to the developer responsible.    The only way to do this reliably is to fail as early as possible, which would force the developer to fix the issue on the spot, when it is still a single, isolated issue.    I can think of two or three very easy to measure stats that you can get:            Number of queries per page.            Number of remote calls (web service, remoting, etc) per page.            Page processing time (only when debugger is not attached!).    I can&#x27;t think of any way to assoicate CPU usage with the current request, otherwise I would have included that as well.    The rapid response cycle here has the same affect is here that it has when fixing bugs. Localized, immediate, fix is much faster / better than a global optimization stage later on.    * You do have a way to associate this data with the specific request, right?</p>

You need to create bad relational model to satisfy the object model that you want.            You have a hard time mapping between the database and the objects, and you are not a beginner.            You goes against well defined concepts such as layering, seperation of concerns, etc.            You need to implement functionality that is already part of the OR/M            You need to do a lot of extra work in order to make the OR/M work correctly.    If any of the above is true for you, STOP! Take a deep breath, and go take a look at the manual. There is a better way.    I believe that I can make OR/M works for 95% of the possible schemas that are out there. And that is a bold statement since I sometimes work with schemas defined for main frames. I also believe that if it is hard to do, it is hard to do because of valid reasons. A good OR/M will steer you in the direction of good database design, when you fight it, it means that there is a problem.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Paul Stovel talks about defaulting to making your code public (accessible to developer). There is nothing more infuriating than looking at the exact code you need in Reflector, yet not being able to call it yourself.     I said it before, many times, and I fully agree with him on that.     Scott Hansleman&#xA0;reponded: When you&#x27;re designing for Users, you do a usability study. When you&#x27;re designing for Developers, you need do a a developability study.     Yes, and when you give me six months and real world use cases, then maybe you can get something out of it. You aren&#x27;t hitting the need of those until you are really deep in complex scenarios. Scenarios that aren&#x27;t going to be covered in any shorter time frame. It is not the scenarios that you thought of when you design the framework that worries me. It is the scenario of needing to integrate the way I work with a new framework and finding out that I need to modify the existing functionality just a little bit, and then finding the hood welded shut. Brian theorized that they didn&#x27;t need as much extensibility as they thought, and shipped a internally basically sealed version. When folks needed something marked virtual, they put it in a queue. The next internal version shipped with something like 7 methods in one class marked virtual - meeting the needs of all - when originally the developers thought they wanted over 50 points of extensibility.     Scott, this is for an internal application, used by several dozens of developers, building most the same kind of applications, right? What Paul is talking about, and I fully cuncur him, is that when you don&#x27;t have a release cycle that is measure in days/weeks, and when your target audiance is far more diverse, you need all those extention points.     In the comments to Scott&#x27;s post, Joshua Flanagan&#xA0;suggests: public override unsupported void Foo(); // overriding a non-virtual method             Widget x = new Widget();         x.$InternalHelper(); // call a non-public method on an object     I have issues with the syntax, but I agree with the idea, for myself, I use the [ThereBeDragons] attribute.     A good point that was raised in this issue was that exposing everything limits extensibility and will hurt forward compatability. As much as I like those terms, they are not sacred. In the name of the Holy Backward Compatability, Microsoft refuses to fix this bug: TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(typeof(int)).IsValid(&quot;abcd&quot;)&#xA0;==&#xA0;true     Is there anyone reading this that thinks that this is a valid approach?! In the name of forward compatability, this approach hurts the developers far more than it helps. In the commercial world, there is such a fuss about Supported vs. Not Supported anyway, so it is not an issue. The framework vendor should have the balls to say, &quot;Breaking Changes&quot; and deal with it.     Thinking that you can control software once it is outside the gate is silly. If I need this functionality, I will get it. Take a look at my SqlCommandSet, huge performance improvement that the ADO.Net team didn&#x27;t see a reason to expose to the outside world. Of course that they didn&#x27;t see a reason, no one tried to build a OR/M framework on 2.0 Alpha/Beta/Gamma until very late into the game, and they didn&#x27;t encounter the batching performance implications until very late into the game.     Microsoft is very good in saying &quot;This is unsupported scenario&quot; (recent example, putting Atlas&#x27; assemblies on the GAC, rather than on the application base, which completely breaks continious integration scenarios) - they should learn to say &quot;unsupported extensability&quot; and move on, instead of slapping sealed and internal over everything and anything in sight. Strangely, on the Java world, where everything is virtual by default, people still do manage to issue a second version of their software. So I don&#x27;t see a big issue there.    Note that I am not saying not to use internal, I use it myself, but usually for very different reasons. To hide complexity or remove things from direct reach. In 95% of the cases, if I have internal, I have a public way of safely overriding it (and if I don&#x27;t, it is a bug, page me).    Let me give an example of a scenario that you wouldn&#x27;t think about until late into development. I have a static IoC class that holds the reference to the IoC container that I am using. Part of the initialization process of my container recursively uses itself to load stuff. I need to replace the container dynamically, but then I hit a problem. I can&#x27;t fully initalize the container because if I do, it will use the previous container and not its own, and I can&#x27;t replace the global container because I have other threads that are running and might access the still-initalizing container and break. This is not something that you are going to run into until very late in the game, and if you can&#x27;t fix this issue, then it is Game Over replace everything from scratch.    Until I run into this scenario, I would have never thought that I would need a seperate container (accessibly globaly) side-by-side with the global container. But I did, and if I had been limited to the external interface, there would have been hell to pay for it.    Make everything public, and only interalize stuff after a lot of careful thought and agonizing decision process. Other people will use your stuff, be polite to them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">NCache&#xA0;has a new version out, and while the freature list seems really impressive, they added support to clustered, fail over caching. I have strong issues with any application where caching is mission critical to the point where you need to cluster it for reliability.    To me, this points to one of two things:            You are Google (and they have other solutions to this).            You rely on the cache to an extent that the application can&#x27;t perform at all without it.</p>
