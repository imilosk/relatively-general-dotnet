            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned in the previous post that the data is coming in a highly relational format, and that the MaxMind advice is to not load this into a relational database, because then queries take a long time. Instead, they have their own efficient binary format.  I decided to put this into RavenDB, and that brought the question, how are we actually going to work with this? How do we model the data? In our code, we defined the following, which I guess would pretty closely match how you model the data in a relational database:  Except&#x2026; In this case, we are actually storing the whole thing as a single entry, like so:  This allows us to query things efficiently and easily. But before we can get there, we need to actually load the data in, which is the topic of my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that we are putting into the new version of the RavenDB Website is some smarts about courses. We want to be able to figure out where a visitor is coming from, and show him relevant courses near him. This is a fairly standard feature, I guess. But I think we solved this in an interesting fashion. First, we had to figure out how to know where a visitor is coming from. This is done via geo location. There are plenty of geo location API, such as:  The problem is that a service like that is limited to ~1000 queries per hour, and we didn&#x2019;t want that. Other option include paid services, again, with either hard limits on the number of queries per hour or an open credit line. Neither option was very interesting to us. Instead, we thought we would try something out. Max Mind is offering a database that can be used for geo location purposes. They have two options, a free database and a paid option. I took the free version for a spin. Here is the GoeLiteCity-Blocks information:  Note that we have repeated rows per location, which allows us to map multiple ranges for each location. And finally, we have GoLiteCity-Location, which map a location id to an actual location:  Anyone who used a relational database should be familiar with the data format, right? I found it really interesting that MaxMind state on their site:  Note that queries made against the CSV data imported into a SQL database can take up to a few seconds. If performance is an issue, the binary format is much faster, and can handle thousands of lookups per second. They actually have a custom binary format to allow faster queries, but I think that I can do something about this. In the next post in this series, I&#x2019;ll talk about how to import this data into RavenDB and the model concerns that we have with it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was asked to comment on this topic:  Here is the link to the full article, but here is the gist:  Performance.The culprit of v5 is our usage of NHibernate. This doesn&#x27;t mean that NHibernate is evil, just that it has turned out to be the wrong fit for our project (in part due to our architecture and db schema, in part due to lack of proper NHibernate experience on the team). It&#x27;s a badly tamed NHibernate that is caused the many N&#x2B;1 SQL statements. The long term solution is to replace NHibernate with native, optimized SQL calls but it&#x27;s a bigger operation that we&#x27;ll look into over the summer. The short team solution is to continue with finding as many bottlenecks as we can as tune those, combined with introducing a Lucene based cache provider which will cache queries and results which will survive app pool restarts (much like the v4 XML cache). The architecture has been prepared for the latter and we&#x27;ll have this in place by the end of May. Another thing that causes massive performance issues is that we&#x27;re seeing a trend where people are calling ToList() on razor queries to compensate for the lack of LINQ features in our implementation. Unfortunately, this causes most (if not all) of the database to be loaded into memory, naturally causing big performance issues (and an enormous number of N&#x2B;1 SQL calls). This leads us to... And a while later:  V5 couldn&#x27;t be fixed. We needed to completely rewrite the entire business layer to ever get v5 into being the type of product people expect from Umbraco I marked the parts that I intend to respond to in yellow, green highlight is for some additional thoughts later on, keep it in mind. Now, to be fair, I looked at Umbraco a few times, but I never actually used it, and I never actually dug deep.  The entire problem can be summed in this page, from the Umbraco documentation site. This is the dynamic model that Umbraco exposes to the views to actually generate the HTML. From the docs:  DynamicModel is a dynamic object, this gives us a number of obvious benefits, mostly a much lighter syntax for accessing data, as well as dynamic queries, based on the names of your DocumentTypes and their properties, but at the same time, it does not provide intellisense.  Any time you provide the view with a way to generate queries, it is a BIG issue. For the purpose of discussion, I&#x2019;ll focus on the following example,&#xA0; also taken from Umbraco docs:     1:  @inherits PartialViewMacroPage   2:  @using Umbraco.Cms.Web   3:  @using Umbraco.Cms.Web.Macros   4:  @using Umbraco.Framework   5:  &#xA0;   6:  @{   7:      @* Get the macro parameter and check it has a value - otherwise set to empty hive Id *@   8:      var startNodeID = String.IsNullOrEmpty(Model.MacroParameters.startNodeID) ? HiveId.Empty.ToString() : Model.MacroParameters.startNodeID;   9:  }  10:  &#xA0;  11:  @* Check that startNodeID is not an empty HiveID AND also check the string is a valid HiveID *@  12:  @if (startNodeID != HiveId.Empty.ToString() &amp;&amp; HiveId.TryParse(startNodeID).Success)  13:  {  14:      @* Get the start node as a dynamic node *@  15:      var startNode = Umbraco.GetDynamicContentById(startNodeID);  16:  &#xA0;  17:      @* Check if the startNode has any child pages, where the property umbracoNaviHide is not True *@      18:      if (startNode.Children.Where(&quot;umbracoNaviHide != @0&quot;, &quot;True&quot;).Any())  19:      {  20:          &lt;ul&gt;  21:              @* For each child page under startNode, where the property umbracoNaviHide is not True *@  22:              @foreach (var page in startNode.Children.Where(&quot;umbracoNaviHide != @0&quot;, &quot;True&quot;))  23:              {   24:                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;@page.Url&quot;&gt;@page.Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  25:              }  26:          &lt;/ul&gt;  27:      }      28:  }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is a great example of why you should never do queries from the views. Put simply, you don&#x2019;t have any idea what is going to happen. Let us start going through the onion, and see where we get.&#xA;Umbraco.GetDynamicContentById &#x2013; Is actually UmbracoHelper.GetDynamicContentById, which looks like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I mean, I guess I could just stop right here, look at the first line, and it should tell you everything. But let us dig deeper. Here is what GetById looks like:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Note that with NHibernate, this is a worst practice, because it forces a query, rather than allow us to use the session cache and a more optimized code paths that Load or Get would use.&#xA;Also, note that this is generic on top of an IQueryable, so we have to go one step back and look at Cms().Content, which is implemented in:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I just love how we dispose of the Unit of Work that we just created, before it is used by any client. But let us dig a bit deeper, okay?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And we still haven&#x2019;t found NHibernate! That is the point where I give up, I am pretty sure that Umbraco 5 is using NHibernate, I just can&#x2019;t find how or where.&#xA;Note that in those conditions, it is pretty much settled that any optimizations that you can offer isn&#x2019;t going to work, since you don&#x2019;t have any good way to apply it, it is so hidden behind all those layers.&#xA;But I am pretty sure that it all end up with a Linq query on top of&#xA0; a session.Query&lt;Content&gt;(), so I&#x2019;ll assume that for now.&#xA;So we have this query in line 15, to load the object, then, on line 18, we issue what looks like a query:&#xA;if (startNode.Children.Where(&quot;umbracoNaviHide != @0&quot;, &quot;True&quot;).Any())&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;We actually issue two queries here, one to load the Children collection, and the second in the Where(). It took a while to figure out what the Where was, but I am pretty sure it is:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Which translate the string to a Linq query, which then have to be translated to a string again. To be perfectly honest, I have no idea if this is executed against the database ( I assume so ) or against the in memory collection.&#xA;Assuming it is against the database, then we issue the same query again, two lines below that.&#xA;And this is in a small sample, think about the implications for a more complex page. When you have most of you data access so abstracted, it is very hard to see what is going on, let alone do any optimizations. And when you are doing data access in the view, the very last thing that the developer has in his mind is optimizing data access.&#xA;This is just setting up for failure. Remember what I said about: replace NHibernate with native, optimized SQL calls, this is where it gets interesting. Just about every best practice of NHibernate was violated here, but the major problem is not the NHibernate usage. The major problem is that there is very little correlation between what is happening and the database. And the number of queries that are likely to be required to generate each page are truly enormous.&#xA;You don&#x2019;t issues queries from the view, that is the #1 reason for SELECT N&#x2B;1, and when you create a system where that seems to be the primary mode of operation, that is always going to cause you issues.&#xA;Replace NHibernate with optimized SQL calls, but you are still making tons of direct calls to the DB from the views. &#xA;I actually agree with the Umbraco decision, it should be re-written. But the starting point isn&#x2019;t just the architectural complexity. The starting point should be the actual interface that you intend to give to the end developer.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For a while, I was absolutely against this, in fact, I refused to implement this several times when asked, because it is complicate to do and indicate design problems in your domain model. During a course today, I found out that I might want to refuse, but the feature is actually in the product for the last two&#x2B; years, we just didn&#x2019;t know about this. But what are tertiary includes in the first place? Let us imagine that we have something like this:  Now, I want to load an order, but also show its Customer and Products. Those are secondary includes, and are very easy to do with RavenDB: var orders = session.Query&lt;Order&gt;()                  .Include(&quot;Customer&quot;)&#xA;                  .Include(&quot;Lines,Product&quot;)&#xA;                  .ToList();&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;There is also a strongly typed option for this, of course. &#xA;What this does is instruct RavenDB to load into the session the Customer and the associated Products into the session, so when you do something like this:&#xA;var cust = session.Load&lt;Customer&gt;(order.Customer);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The value will be loaded from the session cache, without going to the sever. As I said, this is a feature that we have had for quite a while, and it is a really nice one, because it drastically reduce the number of queries that you have to make.&#xA;The problem is that some people want to take it one step further, they want to be able to search on an Order, but also load the Location of a Product. I don&#x2019;t really like this, and as I said, when asked for this feature, I consistently said that it isn&#x2019;t there because it represent a remnant of relational thinking in your design.&#xA;But as it turned out, we do support this, although quite by accident.&#xA;The reason is quite simple, we evaluate Includes only after we evaluate the TranformResults function. Which means that the TranformResults function gets to choose whatever you want to include. Here is how it works:&#xA;TranformResults  = (database, results) =&gt;&#xA;   from result in results&#xA;   select new &#xA;   {&#xA;     Order = result,&#xA;     Locations = result.SelectMany(x=&gt;x.Lines).Select(x=&gt;database.Load&lt;Product&gt;(x.Product).Location)&#xA;   }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And then, you can just ask to Include(&#x201C;Locations&#x201D;), and you are pretty much set.&#xA;Except, that this is a really awkward thing to do, and I don&#x2019;t really like it at all.&#xA;Sure, I don&#x2019;t like this feature, but people will use it, and if it already there, we might as well make it elegant. Therefor, we now have the option of doing:&#xA;TranformResults  = (database, results) =&gt;&#xA;   from result in results&#xA;   let _ = database.Include(result.SelectMany(x=&gt;x.Lines).Select(x=&gt;x.Product))&#xA;   select result;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I think you&#x2019;ll agree that this is much nicer all around, this tells the server to include the data, without us needing to explicitly ask this from the client.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Having just finished giving three courses (2 on RavenDB and 1 on NHibernate), you might want to say that I have a lot of data stuff on my mind. Teaching is always a pleasure to me, and one of the major reasons for that is that I get to actually learn a lot whenever I teach. In this case, in all three courses, we run into an issue with modeling associations. For the sake of the example, let us talk about employees and paychecks. You can see the model below:  Do you note the blue lines? Those represent Employee reference, but while they are both referencing the same employee, they are actually quite different associations. The Manager association is a Current Association. It is just a pointer to the managing employee. What does this means? Let us say that the manager of a certain employee changed her name. In that scenario, when we look at the current employee record, we should see the updated employee manager name. In this case, we are always interested in the current status. On the other hand when looking at the paycheck PaidTo reference to an employee, we have something all together different. We have a reference no to the current employee record, but to the employee record as it was at a certain point in time. If the employee in question change his name, that paycheck was issued to Mr. Version One, not to Mr. Version Two, even though the name has been changed. when dealing with associations, it is important to distinguish between the two options, as each require different way of working with the association.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In 99.9% of the cases, if you see this, it is a mistake:  But I recently came into a place where this is actually a viable solution to a problem. The issue occurs deep inside RavenDB. And it boils down to a managed application not really having any way of actually assessing how much memory it is using.  What I would really like to be able to do is to specify a heap (using HeapCreate) and then say: &#x201C;The following objects should be created on this heap&#x201D;, which would allow to me to control exactly how much memory I am using for a particular task. In practice, that isn&#x2019;t really possible (if you know how, please let me know). What we do instead is to use as much memory as we can, based on the workload that we have. At certain point, we may hit an Out of Memory condition, which we take to mean, not that there is no more memory, but the system&#x2019;s way of telling us to calm down. By the time we reached the exception handler, we already lost all of the current workload, that means that now there is a LOT of garbage around for the GC. Before, when it tried to cleanup, we were actually holding to a lot of that memory, but not anymore. Once an OOME happened, we can adjust our own behavior, to know that we are consuming too much memory and should be more conservative about our operations. We basically reset the clock back and become twice as conservative about using more memory. And if we get another OOME? We become twice as conservative again , and so on. Eventually, even under high workloads and small amount of memory, we complete the task, and we can be sure that we make effective use of the system&#x2019;s resources available to us.</p>
