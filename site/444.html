            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After just a bit over 6 months of work, RavenDB 2.0 stable is finally out!  The new build contains 4,975 commits made by 68 contributors (from the Hibernating Rhinos&#x2019; RavenDB team and externals) and contains improvements on just about every level. We have better performance, faster response times, better operational support, a lot more features and so much more. You can read the entire list here. And with that, I am going to go off into the sunset and go offline for a while. A Memory of Light comes out tomorrow, and I am going to be busy. Beside, we earned it .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jason Folkens had a comment on my previous post:  When people combine methods and data into a class in a way such that you are recommending, I wonder if they truly value the single responsibility principle. In my mind, storing both schema and behavior in the same class qualifies as a violation of the SRP. Do you disagree with me that this is a &#x27;violation&#x27;, or do you just not think the SRP is important? I can&#x2019;t disagree enough. From Wikipedia:  An object contains encapsulated data and procedures grouped together to represent an entity.  The whole point of OOP is to encapsulate both data &amp; behavior. To assume otherwise leads us to stateless functions and isolated DTOs. Or, in other words, procedures and structures. And I think I&#x2019;ll leave that to C.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was review code at a customer site, and he had a lot of classes that looked something like this:      1: public class ValidationData   2: {   3:     public string Type {get;set;}   4:     public string Value {get;set;}   5: }&#xA;In the database, he would have the data like this:&#xA;&#xA;This is obviously a very simple example, but it gets the job done, I think.&#xA;In his code base, the customer had several instance of this example, for validation of certain parts of the system, for handling business rules, for checking how to handle various events, and I think you get the picture. &#xA;I seriously dislike such codebases. You take an innocent piece of code and make it so passive it&#x2026; well, you can see:&#xA;&#xA;Here is why this is bad. The code is passive, it is just a data holder. And that means that in order to process it you are going to have some other code that handles that for you. That likely means a switch statement of the equivalent. And it also means that making any sort of change now have to happen on multiple locations. Puke.&#xA;For fun, using this anti pattern all over your codebase result in you have to do this over and over again, for any new interesting thing that you are doing .It is a lot of work, and a lot of places that you have to change.&#xA;But you can be a hero and set the code free:&#xA;&#xA;You do that by making a very simple change. Instead of having passive data containers that other pieces of the code need to react to, make them active.&#xA;&#xA;   1: public class AvoidCurseWordsValidator : IValidator   2: {   3:    public string[] CurseWords {get;set;}   4:    public void Validate(...) { }   5: }   6:&#xA0;    7: public class MaxLenValidator : IValidator   8: {   9:    public int MaxLen {get; set;}  10:    public void Validate(...) { }  11: }  12:&#xA0;   13: public class InvalidCharsValidator : IValidator  14: {  15:    public char[] InvalidChards {get;set;}  16:    public void Validate(...) { }  17: }&#xA;Now, if we want to modify / add something, we can do this in only one spot. Hurray for Single Responsibility and Open Closed principles.&#xA;SO&#x2026; don&#x2019;t let your codebase be dominated by switch statements, parallel hierarchies and other nasties. Make it go active, and you&#x2019;ll like the results.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">With RavenDB Bulk Inserts, we significantly improved the time we take to insert a boat load of documents to RavenDB. By over an order of magnitude, in fact. How did we do that? By doing a whole bunch of things, but mostly by being smart in utilizing the resources on both client &amp; server. Here is how a standard request timeline looks like:  As you can see, there are several factors that hold us up here. We need to prepare (in memory) all of the data to send. On the server side ,we wait until we have the entire dataset before we can start processing the data. Just that aspect cost us a lot. And because there is finite amount of memory we can use, it means that we have to split things to batches, and each batch is a separate request, requiring the same song and dance just on the network layer. That doesn&#x2019;t count what we have to do on the server end once we actually have the data, which is to get the data, process it, flush it to disk, register it for indexing,&#xA0; call fsync, etc. That isn&#x2019;t too much, unless you are trying to shove as much data s you can, as fast as you can. In contrast, this is how the bulk insert looks like on the network:  We stream the results to the server directly, so while the client is still sending results, we are already flushing them to disk.  To make things even more interesting, we aren&#x2019;t using standard GZip compression over the whole request. Instead, each batch is compressed independently, which means we don&#x2019;t have a dependency on the internals of the compression routine internal buffering system, etc. It also means that we get each batch much faster. There are, of course, rate limits built in, to protect ourselves from flooding the buffers, but for the most part, you will have hard time hitting them.  In addition to that, because we are in the context of a single request, we can apply additional optimizations, we can do lazy flushes (not have to wait for a full fsync for each batch) because we do the final fsync at the end of the final request. Finally, we actually created an optimized code path that skips doing a lot of the things that we do in the normal path. For example, by default we assume you are doing an insert only (saves checking the disk, and will throw if not true), we don&#x2019;t populate the indexing prefetching queue, etc. All in all, it means that we got more than an order of magnitude improvement.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most exciting new features that got into RavenDB 2.0 is the notion of bulk inserts. Unlike the &#x201C;do batches in a loop&#x201D; approach, we actually created an optimized approach and a hand crafted code path that reduce the time of the standard RavenDB saves (which does a lot, but come at a cost). In particular, we made sure that we can parallelize the operation between the client and the server, so we don&#x2019;t have to build the entire request in memory on the client and then wait for it all to be in memory on the server before we can start operation. Instead, we have a fully streamed operation from end to end. Here is what the API looks like:      1: using (var bulkInsert = store.BulkInsert())   2: {   3:     for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000*1000; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   4:     {   5:         bulkInsert.Store(new User {Name = &quot;Users #&quot; &#x2B; i});   6:     }   7: }&#xA;This uses a single request to the server to do all the work. And here are the results: &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This API has several limitations:&#xA;&#xA;You must provide the id at the client side (in this case, generated via hilo).&#xA;It can&#x27;t take part of DTC transactions&#xA;If you want updates, you need to explicitly state (other would throw).&#xA;Put triggers will execute, but the AfterCommit will not.&#xA;This bypass the indexing memory pre fetching layer.&#xA;Changes() will not be raised for documents inserted using bulk-insert.&#xA;There isn&#x27;t a single transaction for the entire operation, rather, this is done in batches and each batch is transactional on its own.&#xA;This is explicitly meant to drop a very large number of records to RavenDB very fast, and it does this very well, typically an order of magnitude or more faster than the &#x201C;batches in a loop&#x201D;&#xA0; approach.&#xA;A note about the last limitation, though. The whole idea here it to reduce, as much as possible, the costs of actually doing a bulk insert. That means that we can&#x2019;t keep a transaction of millions of item open. Instead, we periodically flush the transaction buffer throughout the process. Assuming the default batch size of 512 documents, that means that an error in one of those documents will result in the entire batch of 512 being rolled back, but will not roll back previously committed batches.&#xA;This is done to reduce transaction log size and to make sure that even during a bulk insert operation, we can index the incoming documents while they are being stream in.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned before that the hard part in building RavenDB now isn&#x2019;t the actual features that we add, it is the intersection of features that is causing problems. Case in point, let us look at the new referenced document indexing, which allows you to index data from a related document, and have RavenDB automatically keep it up to date. This was a feature that was requested quite often. Implementing that was complex, but straightforward. We now track what are the documents are referenced by each document, and we know how to force reindexing of a document if a document it was referencing was changed.  So far, so good. It was actually quite easy for us to force re-indexing, all we had to do was to force the referencing document etag to change, and the indexing code would pick it up and re-index that. Simple &amp; easy. Except&#x2026; we use Etags for a lot more than just indexing. For example, we use etags for replication. Now, imagine, if you will, two nodes setup as master/master. Both nodes have an index that uses LoadDocument to refer to another document. We are now in a stable state, both nodes have all documents.&#xA0; We modify a document, which causes that document to be replicated to the second node. That trigger (on both servers) re-indexing of the referencing document.&#xA0; And that, in turn, would cause both servers to want to replicate the new &#x201C;change&#x201D; to the other one. What is worse, RavenDB is smart enough to detect that isn&#x2019;t a conflict, so what we actually get is an infinite distributed loop. Or, another case, pre fetching. As you probably know, an important optimization in RavenDB is the ability to prefetch documents from disk and not have to wait for them. We even augment that by putting incoming documents directly into the prefetching queue, never needing to hit the disk throughout the process. Except that when we designed prefetching, there was never the idea of a having holes in the middle. But touching a document (updating its etag), causes just that. Let us assume that we have three documents (items/1, items/2, items/3). We are saving items/1 and items/3 as part of our standard work. items/1 is being referenced by items/2. That means that on disk, we would have the following etags: (4 &#x2013; items/1, 5 &#x2013; items/2, 6 &#x2013; items/3). However, the prefetching queue will have just (4 &#x2013; items/1, 6 - items/3). This is a hole, and we didn&#x2019;t use to have those (we might have gaps, but there were never any documents in those gaps). So we had to re-write the prefeteching behavior to accommodate that (along the way, we made it much better, but still). Then there were issues relating to optimizations, it turned out that allowing a lot of holes was also not a good idea, so we changed our etag implementation to reduce the chance of holes, and&#x2026; It is interesting work, but it can be quite a hurdle when we want to do a new feature. And then there are the really tough questions. When we load another document during the indexing of another document, what operation should we pass to the read trigger that decide if we can or cannot see this index? Is it Index operation, which means that you won&#x2019;t be able to load versioned documents? Or is it Load documents, which would allow us to read versioned documents, but bring the question of how to deal with this situation? Add a new option? And make each read trigger chose its own behavior? It is a sign of maturity, and I really like the RavenDB codebase, but it is increasing in complexity.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the really annoying things about doing production readiness testing is that you often run into the same bug over &amp; over again. In this case, we have fixed memory obesity issues over and over again.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Just recently, we had the following major issues that we had to deal with:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Optimizations gone wild, O(N!) memory leaks&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Debugging memory issues with RavenDB using WinDBG&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;RavenDB 2.0 StopShip bug: Memory is nice, let us eat it all.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;RavenDB Memory Issue, The Process&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Overall, not fun.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But the saga ain&#x2019;t over yet. We had a test case, we figure out what was going on, and we fixed it, damn it. And then we went to prod and figured out that we didn&#x2019;t fix it after all. I&#x2019;ll spare you the investigative story, suffice to say that we finally ended up figuring out that we are to blame for optimizing for a specific scenario.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In this case, we have done a lot of work to optimize for very large batches (import scenario), and we set the Lucene merge factor at a very high level (way too high, as it turned out). That was perfect for batching scenarios. But not so good for non batching scenarios. That resulted in us having to hold in memory a lot of lucene segments. Segments aren&#x2019;t expensive, but they each have their own data structures. That works, sure, but when you start having tens of thousands of those, we are back in the previous story, where a relatively small objects come together in unexpected ways to kill us in nasty ways. Reducing the merge factor meant that we would keep only very small amount of segments, and avoided the problem entirely.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The best thing about this? I had to chase a bunch of false leads and ended up fixing what would have been a separate memory leak that would have gone unnoticed otherwise .&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And now, let us see if stopping work at quarter to six in the morning is conductive for proper rest, excuse me, I am off to bed.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">To start with, I don&#x2019;t have any association with them, I got nothing (no money, free license, promise of goodwill or anything else at all) from the SciTech Software (the creators of .NET Memory Profiler.  This tool has been instrumental in figuring out our recent memory issues. I have tried dotTrace Memory, JustTrace and WinDBG, but this tool outshone them all and was able to point us quite quickly to the root cause that we had to deal with, and from there, it was quite easy to reach a solution. Highly recommended.</p>
