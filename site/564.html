            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is just something that really annoys me. There is a common misconception that compilers are mostly about parsing the code. This couldn&#x2019;t be further from the truth. About the easiest step in building a compiler is parsing the text into some form of machine readable format. There are great tools to help you there, and a lot of information.   It is the next stage that is complex, taking the machine readable format (AST) and turning that into executable. There is a lot less information about that, and that tends to be a pretty gnarly sort of a problem.  As the title says, this post is here just to make sure that people distinguish between the two.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">About two weeks ago I posted my spike results of porting NHProf to Linq to SQL, a few moments ago I posted screenshots of the code that is going to private beta.&#xA;I spent most of the last week working on the never-ending book, but that is a subject for a different post. Most of the time that I actually spent on the profiler wasn&#x2019;t spent on integrating with Linq to SQL. To be frank, it took me two hours to do basic integration to Linq to SQL. That is quite impressive, considering that is from the point of view of someone who never did anything more serious with it than the hello world demo, and it was years ago. The Linq to SQL codebase is really nice.&#xA;Most of the time went into refactoring the profiler. I know that I am going to want to add additional OR/Ms (and other stuff) there, so I spent the time to make the OR/M into a concept in the profiler. That was a big change, but it was mostly mechanical. All the backend changes are done, and plugging in a new OR/M should take about two hours, I guess.&#xA;For Linq to SQL, however, the work is far from over, while we are now capable of intercepting, displaying and analyzing Linq to SQL output, the current Linq to SQL profiler, as you can see in the screen shots, is using the NHibernate Profiler skin, we need to adapt the skin to match Linq to SQL (different names, different options, etc).&#xA;That is the next major piece of work that we have left to do before we can call the idea of OR/Ms as a concept done, and release Linq to SQL as a public beta.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Since my last post about it, there has been a lot of changes to NHibernate Shards.      Update: I can&#x2019;t believe I forgot, I was so caught up in how cool this was that I did give the proper credits. Thanks to Dario Quintana and all the other contributors to NHibernate Shards.   The demo actually works :-) You can look at the latest code here: http://nhcontrib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nhcontrib/trunk/src/NHibernate.Shards/  You can read the documentation for the Java version (most of which is applicable for the .NET version) here: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/shards/reference/en/html/  Let us go through how it works, okay?  We have the following class, which we want to shard.    The class mapping is almost standard:     As you can see, the only new thing is the primary key generator. Because entities are sharded based&#xA0; on their primary key, we have to encode the appropriate shard in the shard. The easiest way of doing that is using the SharedUUIDGenerator. This generator generates keys that looks like this:     00010000602647468c2ef2f10ded039a    000200006ba74626a564d147dc89f9ad    00030000eb934532b828601979036e3c   The first four characters are reserved for the shard id.   Next, we need to specify the configurations for each shard, we can do this normally, but we have to specify the shard id in the configuration.          cfg.SetProperty(ShardedEnvironment.ShardIdProperty, 1);&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The shard id is an integer that is used to select the appropriate shard. It is also used to allow you to add new shards without breaking the ids of already existing shards.&#xA;&#xA;Next, you need to implement a shard strategy factory:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;This allows you to configure the shard strategy based on your needs. This is often where you would add custom behaviors. A shard strategy is composed of several components:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;The Shard Selection Strategy is used solely to select the appropriate shard for new entities. If you shard your entities based on the user name, this is where you&#x2019;ll implement that, by providing a shard selection strategy that is aware of this. On of the nice things about NH Shards is that it is aware of the graph as a whole, and if you have an association to a sharded entity, it knows that it needs to place you in the appropriate shard, without giving the burden to you.&#xA;&#xA;For new objects, assuming that you haven&#x2019;t provided your own shard selection strategy, NHibernate Shards will try to spread them evenly between the shards. The most common implementation is the Round Robin Load Balancer, which will give you a new shard for each new item that you save.&#xA;&#xA;The Shard Resolution Strategy is quite simple, given an entity and the entity id, in which shard should we look for them?&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;If you are using a sharded id, such as the one that WeatherReport is using, NH Shards will know which shard to talk to automatically. But if you are using a non sharded id, you have to tell NHibernate how to figure out which shards to look at. By default, if you have non sharded id, it will look at all shards until it finds it.&#xA;&#xA;The shard access strategy specifies how NHibernate Shards talks to the shards when it needs to talk to more than a single shard. NHibernate Shards can do it either sequentially or in parallel. Using parallel access strategy means that NHibernate will hit all your databases at the same time, potentially saving quite a bit of time for you.&#xA;&#xA;The access strategy is also responsible for handling post processing the queries result, merging them and ordering them as needed.&#xA;&#xA;Let us look at the code, okay? As you can see, this is a pretty standard usage of NHibernate. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  using(ISession session = sessionFactory.OpenSession())using(session.BeginTransaction()){    session.Save(new WeatherReport                     {                         Continent = &quot;North America&quot;,                         Latitude = 25,                         Longitude = 30,                        ReportTime = DateTime.Now,                         Temperature = 44                     });    session.Save(new WeatherReport                 {                     Continent = &quot;Africa&quot;,                     Latitude = 44,                     Longitude = 99,                     ReportTime = DateTime.Now,                     Temperature = 31                 });    session.Save(new WeatherReport                 {                     Continent = &quot;Asia&quot;,                     Latitude = 13,                     Longitude = 12,                    ReportTime = DateTime.Now,                     Temperature = 104                 });    session.Transaction.Commit();}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Since we are using the defaults, each of those entities is going to go to a different shard. Here is the result:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   &#xA;&#xA;Our data was saved into three different databases. And obviously we could have saved them to three different servers as well.&#xA;&#xA;But saving the data is only part of things, what about querying? Well, let us look at the following query:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    session.CreateCriteria(typeof(WeatherReport), &quot;weather&quot;).List()&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This query will give us:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Note that we have three different sessions here, each for its own database, each executing a single query. What is really interesting is that NHibernate will take all of those results and merge them together. It can even handle proper ordering across different databases.&#xA;&#xA;Let us see the code:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    var reports =    session.CreateCriteria(typeof(WeatherReport), &quot;weather&quot;)        .Add(Restrictions.Gt(&quot;Temperature&quot;, 33))        .AddOrder(Order.Asc(&quot;Continent&quot;))        .List();foreach (WeatherReport report in reports){    Console.WriteLine(report.Continent);}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Which results in:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;And in the following printed to the console:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  Asia&#xA;    North America&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;We got the proper ordering, as we specified in the query, but note that we aren&#x2019;t handling ordering in the database. Because we are hitting multiple sources, it is actually cheaper to do the ordering in memory, rather than get partially ordered data and they trying to sort it.&#xA;&#xA;Well, that is about it from the point of view of the capabilities. &#xA;&#xA;One of the things that is holding NH Shards back right now is that only core code paths has been implemented. A lot of the connivance methods are currently not implemented.&#xA0; &#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;They are relatively low hanging fruits, and can be implemented without any deep knowledge of NHibernate or NHibernate Shards. Beyond that, the sharded HQL implementation is still not handling order properly, so if you care about ordering you can only query using ICriteria (at the moment). &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;It isn&#x2019;t there yet, but it is much closer. You can get a working demo, and probably start working with this and implement things on the fly as you run into things. I strongly urge you to contribute the missing parts, at least the convenience methods, which should be pretty easy.&#xA;&#xA;Please submit patches to our JIRA and discuss the topic at: http://groups.google.com/group/nhcdevs</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am getting some strange perf numbers from MSMQ, and I can&#x2019;t quite figure out what is going on here.  The scenario is simple, I have a process reading from queue 1 and writing to queue 2. But performance isn&#x2019;t anywhere near where I think it should be.  In my test scenario, I have queue 1 filled with 10,000 messages, each about 1.5 Kb in size. My test code does a no op move between the queues. Both queues are transactional.  Here is the code:          private static void CopyData(){    var q1 = new MessageQueue(@&quot;.\private$\test_queue1&quot;);    var q2 = new MessageQueue(@&quot;.\private$\test_queue2&quot;);    q2.Purge();    var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();    while (true)    {        using (var msmqTx = new MessageQueueTransaction())        {            msmqTx.Begin();            Message message;            try            {                message = q1.Receive(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(0), msmqTx);            }            catch (MessageQueueException e)            {                Console.WriteLine(e);                break;            }            q2.Send(message, msmqTx);            msmqTx.Commit();        }    }    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0:#,#}&quot;, sp.ElapsedMilliseconds);}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Using this code, it takes 236.8 seconds to move 10,000 messages. If I use System.Transactions, instead of MSMQ&#x2019;s internal transactions, I get comparable speeds.&#xA;&#xA;Just to give you an idea, this is about 40 messages a second, this number is ridiculously low.&#xA;&#xA;Changing the code so each operation is a separate transaction, like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    private static void CopyData(){    var q1 = new MessageQueue(@&quot;.\private$\test_queue1&quot;);    var q2 = new MessageQueue(@&quot;.\private$\test_queue2&quot;);    q2.Purge();    var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();    while (true)    {        Message message;        try        {            message = q1.Receive(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(0), MessageQueueTransactionType.Single);        }        catch (MessageQueueException e)        {            Console.WriteLine(e);            break;        }        q2.Send(message, MessageQueueTransactionType.Single);    }    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0:#,#}&quot;, sp.ElapsedMilliseconds);}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Means that it takes 16.3 seconds, or about 600 messages per second, which is far closer to what I would expect.&#xA;&#xA;This is on a quad core machine 8 GB RAM (4 GB free), so I don&#x2019;t think that it is the machine that is causing the problem. I can see similar results on other machines as well.&#xA;&#xA;Am I missing something? Is there something in my code that is wrong?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently had the chance to reminisce, and I run into this post, this is me in 2004, talking about my logo:    People frequently ask my, &#x201C;Why Rhinos?&#x201D;, here is the answer, from way back ago:     I thought about using some sort of a symbol to create the logo, I toyed for a while with the Windings font, but found that lacking for my purposes, then I thought about using an animal&#x27;s shadow as the watermark. I thought about using some sort of dragon or a wolf, but those are really banal. I spent some time thinking about it until I finally decided to use a Rhino, I just thought about it and I think that it&#x27;s cool. Beside, I don&#x27;t know anyone else that uses Rhinos.   The logo and the general orange theme of the blog, were decisions that I just made, there was no deep thinking involved. My living room has a lot of orange in it right now, and I have a Rhino tattoo.  It is funny how such small a decision can have such a significant impact.  Can you imagine Wolf.Mocks?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just had to go through a code base where I had a bunch of of comments.   Instead of going with the usual route of just noting the changes that I think should be done, I decided to do something else. I fixed each individual change, and commit them individually.   This is how it looks like, each commit is usually less than a single screen of changes (diff mode).     I wonder if it is something that I can apply more generally.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I spoke in the past about the importance of UI mockups. I consider them an essential part of software design. It is often much easier to gather requirements when you are talking in concrete terms about how the software looks like.  It is important to note that I do not care about the look and feel of the mockup, in fact, I don&#x2019;t want it to look good, it should have a drafty look that would make it clear that this is just a mockup. It is a communication tool as much as anything else. It just allow me to talk about things in concrete terms.  A while ago I found Balsamiq, and I was happy. Balsamiq does just about everything that I want from a UI mockup tool.  Except, it doesn&#x2019;t do Hebrew :-(.  That prompt me to start looking at several other UI mockup tools, to see if there are any that do support Hebrew and that I can tolerate them.  I tried a few others, and got varying support for Hebrew. The best ones from Hebrew support perspective where Mockup Screens and Blend&#x2019;s SketchFlow.   My test scenario was this UI (in Hebrew):     This is Balsamiq mock, which took about 3 minutes to build, the first time I used Balsamiq.  I could get it in Mockup Screens after about ten minutes of playing with the options to get it working. Mockup Screens is nice, but it is giving me too many knobs to turn. I felt it especially when I tried to do the table. I had to specify columns &amp; rows, and specifying the data was done in a separate dialog.  It works, but it is awkward.  The next one I tried is Blend&#x2019;s SketchFlow. I heard a lot of excitement about it, so I tried to give it a spin. A Silverlight 3 SketchFlow project simply does not support Hebrew. A WPF SketchFlow does, and that exposed me to a very nasty surprise. I was expected a way to easily build sketches of the screens that I was interested in.  Basically, something similar to what Balsamiq gives me. What it turns out is that there are a few simple controls (check box, drop down, etc) and everything else that you want you need to actually sketch. That is, sit down and draw it.  The problem is that this take inordinate amount of time. Especially if you are actually trying to do something like the screen above. I just wan&#x2019;t a stupid table with some data, but this was way too hard to do in SketchFlow. If I am reduced to literally drawing on the screen, I might as well draw it on paper. It is about as easy to manipulate, at that stage.  In the end, I think that what I&#x2019;ll end up doing is using Excel or Word as the mockup tool. They both have good Hebrew support, and they can do things like tables, drop downs and checkbox easily, which is pretty much all I need. It also make it perfectly clear that this isn&#x2019;t something executable.  And if you don&#x2019;t care for Hebrew support, go and use Balsamiq, it is awesome.   Update:  Matt Kellogg has informed me that you can use Balsamiq with Hebrew support, all you need to do is set Use System Fonts:     And once that is done, it took only a few moments to handle this:     Now, it does suffer from all the usual RTL problems, but it is working, and it is still by far the best one out there.</p>
