Just graduated, did so and so course and was excellent in foo and bar. We see dozens of CVs like that on a regular basis. But the portfolio link was very nice. It linked to a Google Drive folder with a bunch of games that the candidate made, in various languages.I didn&#x2019;t actually went and read all the code, but I really skimmed through a bunch of projects there. I actually like the portfolio a lot better than a github link. A portfolio is explicitly about showing a potential employer what you can do. A github link can be used for many things.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There is a lock deep inside RavenDB that has been bugging me for a while. In essence, this is a lock that prevents a read transaction from opening during a particular section of the commit process of a write transaction. The section under lock does no I/O and only manipulate in memory data structure. Existing read transactions aren&#x2019;t impacted, it is only the opening of a read transaction that is blocked. It isn&#x2019;t usually visible in production systems. The only scenario you might expect to see it is if you have a very high degree of writes at the same time as you have a lot of read requests. In that case, RavenDB&#x2019;s lock contention would rise and you would be able to process only about 5,000 &#x2013; 10,000 read requests per second at the same time as you can process 30,000 write requests per second.&#xA0; In practice, because of the way we process requests, you&#x2019;ll very rarely be able to hit that level of concurrency in anything but a benchmark. But it bugged me. It was one of those scenarios that stood up like a sore thumb when we looked at the performance metrics. In any other case, we are orders of magnitudes faster, but here we hit a speed bump. So I fixed it. I changed the code so there would be no sharing of data between the write and read transactions, which eliminated the need for the lock. The details are fairly simple, I moved the structured being modified to a single class and then atomically replace the pointer to this class. Easy, simple and much much cheaper. This also had the side affect of slowing us down by a factor of 4. Here are the profiler results after the change:That&#x2026; is not a desirable property for a performance optimization. Luckily, I was able figure out from the profiler what was causing the slowdown:As it turned out, there was another lock there. This one was used to avoid starving a particular portion of the code under high write scenario. Until we removed the first lock, this worked beautifully. But when the first lock was removed, that actually sped us the rest of the system which meant that we&#x2019;ll acquire the second lock a lot more often. That, in turn, results in a rare occurrence becoming very common and the contention on the lock cause a major slowdown.We were able to figure out that the lock is now no longer needed, due to some other changes. We just removed this lock entirely, giving us over 10% perf over the original code, without even mentioning the actual scenario we are trying to test.Now, you might have noticed that this benchmark I&#x2019;m running is for pure writes, right? Let&#x2019;s see what happens when we have more complex workloads, and are testing things without the profiler:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;ReadsWrites2/3 Reads &amp; 1/3 Writes&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Original&#xA;385,510&#xA;85,688&#xA;91,984&#xA;Optimized416,46890,38092,323&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This table shows the number of scenarios and the requests per second on each. We can see just under 10% improvement for reads, over 5% improvement for writes (which are excellent numbers). However, the mixed workload, where we expected to see the most performance boost has a difference that is pretty much a sampling error. I&#x2019;m not sure how I feel about that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As the final post in this series, I decided to see how I can create a complex query. Given the NSA&#x2019;s statement, I decided to see if I can use LemonGraph to find a dog of interest. In particular, given our graph, I wanted to find start with a particular dog and find another dog that likes this dog that also like a dog that dislike the original.As a reminder, here is the graph:And starting from Arava, I want to find a dog that likes Arava that also likes a dog that isn&#x2019;t liked by Arava.The LemonGraph query language isn&#x2019;t very expressive, or at least I&#x2019;m not familiar enough with it to make it work properly. I decided on the following query:n(type=&quot;dog&quot;, value=&quot;arava&quot;)-&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; @e(type=&quot;likes&quot;, value=&quot;yes&quot;)-&gt;n(type=&quot;dog&quot;)-&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; @e(type=&quot;likes&quot;, value=&quot;yes&quot;)-&gt;n(type=&quot;dog&quot;)-&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; @e(type=&quot;likes&quot;, value=&quot;no&quot;)-&gt;@N(type=&quot;dog&quot;, value=&quot;arava&quot;)This is a bit of a brute force method to do this. It encodes the path directly. There are a few minor things that might not be obvious here. The @ prefix means don&#x2019;t return this to the user and the N() indicates that we shouldn&#x2019;t filter already seen values. I can certainly see how this can be useful for certain things . I wonder if LemonGraph has a better way to express such a query.This is the first time I actually reviewed this kind of codebase, where some things are done in C and some in Python. It was quite interesting to see the interaction between them. The codebase itself is really interesting, but I found it really hard to follow at times. The love affair with tuples and dynamic behavior made the code non trivial and likely is going to cause maintenance issues down the line. It is also quite obvious that this is intended for internal consumption, with very little time or effort spent on &#x201C;productization&#x201D;. By that I meant things like better query errors and more obvious thing to do. It has an interesting approach to solving the problem of graph queries and I&#x2019;ve learned quite a few things from it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After going over many layers inside LemonGraph, I think we are ready to get to the real deal. We know how LemonGraph starts to execute a query. It find the clause that is likely to have the least number of items and starts from there. These are the seeds of the query, but how is it going to actually process that?Here is my graph:And here is the query that I want to run on it: n()-&gt;e(type=&quot;likes&quot;, value=&quot;yes&quot;)-&gt;n()LemonGraph detects that the cheapest source of seeds for this query is the edge and provides these to the MatchCTX class which does the actual processing. Let&#x2019;s explore how it is working on a single seed. The actual behavior starts from the matches() method, which starts here:As usual for this codebase, the use of tuples for controlling behavior is prevalent and annoying. In this case, the idx argument controls the position of the target in the query, whatever this is the start, end or somewhere in the middle. The deltas define what direction the matches should go and the stops where you must stop searching, I think.Now that we setup the ground rules, the execution is as follows:In this case, because the seed of our query is the edge (which is in the middle) it determines that deltas are (1, &#x2013;1) and stops are (2, 0). We&#x2019;ll also go to the first clause in the if statement. The link variable there controls whatever we should follow links going in or out. There is a lot of logic actually packed into the link initialization. The self.link is an array that has &#x2018;next&#x2019; and &#x2018;prev&#x2019; as its values, so the idea is that it find what property to look at, then use the dictionary syntax to get the relevant property and decide what kind of direction it should go. We&#x2019;ll focus on the _recurse() method for now. In this case, we are being passed:idx = 1delta = 1stop = 2Here is the actual method:As you can see, we first validate that the match is valid (this is where we mostly check other properties of the value that we are currently checking, filtering them in place). Usually the do_seen will be set to True, which will ensure that we only traverse each node once. The main iteration logic is done in combination with the _next() method, shown below: The first line there shows usage of delta, which control in what direction to move. I&#x2019;m not quite sure why the filter is set in the if statements, since it is also being set immediately after. This looks like redundant code that snuck in somehow. The bulk of the work is shelled out to iterlinks, so let&#x2019;s check what is going on there&#x2026; I know that we are running on an edge here, so we need to look at the Edge.iterlinks() method:There isn&#x2019;t really much to tell here, it checks the filters and return the incoming or outgoing edges, nothing more. On the other hand, the Node.iterlinks() implementation is a bit simpler:We&#x2019;ll explore exactly how the edges are loaded for a node in a bit, however, I do want to note right now that the _next() method isn&#x2019;t passing the types of the edge, even though it looks to me that it has this information. In that case, that would give a performance boost because it could filter a lot of edges in busy graphs.Actually, I already looked at how iterators working in a previous post, so I won&#x2019;t go over all of that again. This is basically calling this methodThe graph_node_edges_in() and graph_node_edges_out() methods are pretty simple, basically just scanning the DB_TGTNODE_IDX or DB_SRCNODE_IDX indexes, respectively. The graph_node_edges() however, is really strange. Here it is:It took me a few reads to figure out that this is probably a case of someone unpacking a statement for debugging but forgetting to remove the packed statement. The second return statement is ignored and likely stripped out as unreachable, but it is pretty confusing to read.The graph_iter_concat() answers a question I had about how graph_iter_t is used, here is how it looks like:This is using C&#x2019;s support for passing an unknown number of parameters to a method. This basically builds a simple linked list, which also answers the usage of _blarf() function and its behavior a few posts ago.So we are back were we started, we understand how the data flows into the Python code, now let&#x2019;s go back and look at _recurse() and _next() calls.Now I know a lot more about the behavior of the code, so this make sense. The stop argument to the _recurse() control the depth of the number of links that would be traversed in a particular query. Now that I know how this particular clause work, I understand how LemonGraph goes from the edge to the node in e()-&gt;n(), but I don&#x2019;t know how it goes to back to find the full path. The key for that are the calls to push()&#xA0; and pop() in the the MatchCtx._recurse() methods. These update the chain, like so:In processing the query, we first append the edge to the chain:The next step goes from the edge to it&#x2019;s destination, giving us Oscar:Remember that in the matches(), we got into this if clause:This is when we start scanning an edge, which first add things to the right, then it scan things to the left in the _next() method. Look at the push() method there. By the time we get to the result(), we have iterated both sides of the connection, giving us:That is a very clever way of doing things. Let&#x2019;s try doing things a little bit differently. I&#x2019;m going to check a slightly different query: n(type=&#x201D;dog&#x201D;, value=&#x201D;arava&#x201D;)-&gt;e(type=&quot;likes&quot;, value=&quot;yes&quot;)-&gt;n()If I understand things correctly, this is going to select the node as the starting point, because that is a lot more efficient. That will allow me to figure out the other side of this operation. I just run this through the debugger, and this is indeed how it actually works. The usage of yield to pass control midway is not trivial to follow, but it ends up being quite a nice implementation. This is enough for this post. In my next one, I want to explore a few of the possible operations that exposed by LemonGraph.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I said before that I don&#x2019;t want to get into the details of how LemonGraph is dealing with parsing the queries. Unfortunately, I can&#x2019;t avoid that. There seems to be a lot of logic, magic and mystery in the MatchLGQL() class, which is critical to understanding how queries work.The problem is that either my Python-fu is lacking or it is just really hard to figure out a non trivial codebase behavior in a dynamic language like python. I find it hard to figure out what data is stored where and how it is manipulated. Therefor, I decided to break with my usual custom and actually run the code in the debugger to try to follow what is going on there. I tried to run this on WSL, but it crashed horribly, so I had to spin up a VM and setup PyCharm on it. First time that I&#x2019;m actually using that and the experience is pretty nice so far. Being able to inspect things directly means that it is much easier to figure out the behavior of the code. In order to explore how queries work in LemonGraph, I created the following graph, which represents the relationships between my dogs:Here is how this looks like in code:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

And it finds:Arava &#x2013;&gt; OscarOscar &#x2013;&gt; AravaOscar &#x2013;&gt; PheobeNow that we have a query that we can sink our teeth into, let&#x2019;s figure out how this work, shall we? Inside the dreaded MatchLGQL() class, there are all sorts of regular expressions running on the parse this thing, but eventually we get to the partially processed parsed query:This screen shot might explain why I wasn&#x2019;t happy with the code structure for figuring out what is going on without debugging. The number of tuples here is quite amazing, and they are used everywhere. This make static analysis (as in, just reading the code) too hard for me. But with the debugger, that is much easier. If you are familiar with ASTs, this should be pretty easy to figure out.Here is a piece of code that we already looked at (and criticized), this is in munge_obj() method, where it is deciding how to optimize the query:This piece of code is critical for the performance of the system. And it is really hard to understand. Here is what is going on.The accel array tell a later piece of code how to accelerate the query, using the type or type and value to start from a particular source. The info is used to carry state about particular clause in the query. Before this code run there is some code that builds the dictionary d which is used to figure out the filters on the particular clause. This is fun, because it is using missing a key lookup in the dictionary for control flow.Let&#x2019;s follow the logic?Line 2 - If the clause operates on a node, rank it as 6. If it is an edge, rank it as 7.Line 6 &#x2013; If the clause has a type specified, rank is as 4 if it is a node, 5 if it is an edge. Otherwise, abort the optimization.You might not see the &#x201C;abort this optimization&#x201D; in line 6, because it relies on the dictionary to throw if the key isn&#x2019;t found. This is a common pattern in this code and something that I personally greatly dislike.Line 8 &#x2013; it uses the length of the type as a metric for secondary ranking. I&#x2019;m not quite sure why this is the case. I guess the code needed a tie breaker, but I can&#x2019;t imagine why the length of a type would have any impact on performance.Unless, of course, the code assumes that shorter types are more common, and therefor will prefer to use the rare longer types?Line 10 &#x2013; If there is a type and a value defined, that is even better. Note that again the is the ranking of node (2) and edge (3) which I find non obvious.Here are the results of the matches after they have been munged, I marked the ranking:Looking at this, this seems very strange, the rank2 value is 1 in the second element, but I expected it to be the length of the string. As it turns out, this is not working directly on the string, it is working on the tuple of possible values, so the secondary ranking here is not based on the length of the type or the value but on the number of possible types and values that were specified for each clause.The code judges that the best place to start this query is with the second entry, since it is the most specific option. This in turn takes us the the seeds() method that we previously covered. In this case, the code is going to hit this branch:This means that it is going to be iterating over all the edges of a particular type and filtering them in Python code. This is strange, because the on disk indexes actually support doing a direct query on the (type, value) directly and would probably be much cheaper in the case you have many values for a particular type of an edge. In fact, just that is implemented for querying nodes by (type, value):I&#x2019;m guessing that they are either don&#x2019;t have a lot of queries on (type, value) on edges or not a lot of different values for edge types that they can optimize in this manner.That is enough for now, I have a pretty good grasp of how queries are parsed and how they fetch data from the underlying storage. The next post will talk about how LemonGraph takes the seeds of the query and execute the actual graph operations on them. The code that does this is tight and will require a full post to explore properly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Before going over the actual query implementation, I wanted to talk about something that I just realized. I said previously that I don&#x2019;t understand why LemonGraph is using its integer encoding method, because it is less efficient than using variant sized integer. What I didn&#x2019;t take into account is that the method LemonGraph is using gives short, but sortable, integers.Here is the encoding method:Now, let&#x2019;s see what kind of binary output this will generate when given a few numbers:The key here is that the number of bytes is stored as the first item. This means that when we compare two numbers using memcmp(), the number with more bytes is considered greater. This is indeed the case, because if you need more bytes to store a number, it is obviously larger.What about two numbers that have the same number of bytes? This is handled by simple binary comparison of the values. If they are the same size, the fact that the encode() output them in big endian format means that we can compare them using memcmp() and be done with it.This is a really nice way to both keep the values sorted and to avoid storing the full 8 bytes for numbers that are usually much smaller.</p>
