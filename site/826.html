            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There are some interesting points of views about testable design that I somehow missed catching in real time.    Roy Osherove:...in many ways, pure object oriented design does not go well hand in hand with the notion of testable design.    He then goes on to show what happens when you addTestability concerns to the some of the usual OOD principals.    Eli Lupian:Roy and I are on the opposite sides of this methodology. I personally hate to change my production code just for the tests.As Roy says &#x201C;pure object oriented design does not go well hand in hand with the notion of testable design.&#x201D; After creating a good design (without taking testability into account), there is no real business value of implementing hooks to change internal private members and to expose properties that should remain private by design! Unless you want to clutter your code with load of Totally Irrelevant Code Please, Stop Designing for testability!!     He then shows how you can keep traditional OOP approach and still test your code using TypeMock.    I am firmly in Roy&#x27;s camp when it comes for designing code to be testable. Before I goes on to explain further, I want to take issue with a couple of points in Eli&#x27;s post:Have you ever tried to browse a code with loads of interfaces, it take ages because you have to keep finding the concrete implementation, and the place where the instance was created.    Ctrl&#x2B;Alt&#x2B;B in Resharper will take me directly to the implementation. grep *.cs -S &quot;interface\s&#x2B;INameOfInterface&quot; will do the same if I don&#x27;t have Resharper. Not an issue.Think about this&#xA0;code smell: When you find that an interface and implementation have exactly the&#xA0;same public methods, it is a sign that the interface is not exposing a trait of the object but the Object itself    No a code smell at all, in my opinion, just good seperation of the interface and its implementation. I may want to supply alternate implementation, which would be much harder if I had to a concrete class to work with.    Let me share a story. A&#xA0;while ago I was working on a system that needed to write to a file. The simplest code that I could write was:File.WriteAllText(filename,&#xA0;text);    That is not testable without using an invasive approach like TypeMock, so I choose this way:using(TextWriter&#xA0;writer&#xA0;=&#xA0;IoC.Resolve&lt;IFileWriterFactory&gt;().Create(filename))    &#xA0;&#xA0;writer.Write(text);    I added two level of abstractions to the code, just to make it testable. Following Eli&#x27;s approach, I had decreased the readability of the code and made it harder to understand and maintain. The problem is that I don&#x27;t think that Eli considered the value of the seams that are created by writing testable code. (Take a look at the stats here, it was a bit more involved).    A seam is a core concept in Working Effectively With Legacy Code. A seam is a place where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place. They are crucial for being able to test your code. (Just to note, TypeMock create seams all over the place by simply being able to intercept any call under .Net).    Seams makes the code testable, but it also makes it a lot more flexible. Couple of weeks after I introduced the IFileWriterFactory, I had&#xA0;learned that the files that I was creating were to be consumed by a stupid batch process, which would copy them over to a mainframe system. If I happened to be in the middle of creating the file when the process start running, the mainframe would get a partial file, and chaos would enuse.    The standard way of handling this is to actually output two files, one with the real content, the second with an agreed upon extension, which basically tells the process &quot;if you see a file with extension foo.csv.done, I have finished writing the file foo.csv&quot;. I had couple hundreds places in the application that I was writing files.    If I was following the traditional approach, I had to find all the places that I was writing to a file, and change the to:File.WriteAllText(filename,&#xA0;text);    File.WriteAllText(filename&#x2B;&quot;.done&quot;, &quot;&quot;);    As I mentioned, there were quite a few place that did it. Because I had a seam in place, I could simple change the returned implementation of the TextWriter that FileWriterFactory implemented, which would generate the &quot;.done&quot; file when the writer was disposed. You can bet that this was a valuable thing to be able to do.    In general, I find that testable design if far more flexible, because it means that you can inject different behaviors into the code. This means that you get more extensible code that you can later leverage to produce more business value. The simple abstraction that I have shown above is something that saved me two days of mindlessly going through the code and making the same stupid change all over the place.Theoretically, I could probably use some black magic and intercepted the call to FileSteam.Close() and do the same. I do not feel that it would be a maintainable or discoverable solution at all.    So no, I do not believe that testability is not a first class concern, and I feel that it produce much better code in the end. Having more places where you can change the behavior without changing the code is a good thing, and it would end up saving you quite a bit of time. I can see it in Rhino Mocks all over the place, the fact that it is as decoupled as that means that I can take it in different directions (and offer extensability points for users) very easily.     The other side is apperant in many recent Microsoft releases, where internal and sealed are slapped on just about anything, and extensability points for something that they didn&#x27;t explicitly planned are simply non-existant. This in turn greatly reduce the ability to work with the code.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got some really great comments on my last post. Apperantly FireFox doesn&#x27;t report on the wire numbers, so here are the numbers from Fiddler.     After clearing the cache, a page with a text box, ScriptManager and CalendarExtender:      Request Count: &#xA0;17    Bytes Sent: &#xA0;10,492    Bytes Received: 149,145      Refreshing the page (meaning we get stuff from the cache):      Request Count: &#xA0;14    Bytes Sent: &#xA0;9,382    Bytes Received: 31,932      That is still 31Kb that I am not sure where they are coming from. Based on the feedback from the last post, it looks like there are a few other things that need to be done.             Get AjaxToolKit that is compiled in release mode.                         &lt;compilation debug=&quot;false&quot;&gt;                                                      &lt;                         scriptResourceHandler enableCompression=&quot;true&quot; enableCaching=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;                 After clearing the cache, same page:      Request Count: &#xA0;14    Bytes Sent: &#xA0;9,282    Bytes Received: 122,254      Refresh the page (get stuff from cache):      Request Count: &#xA0;14    Bytes Sent: &#xA0;9,382    Bytes Received: 32,010      So, we still get 31Kb, but worse than that, we get 14 requests(!).     Same page, without CalendarExtender (no cache):      Request Count: &#xA0;5    Bytes Sent: &#xA0;2,806    Bytes Received: 56,702      With cache:      Request Count: &#xA0;4    Bytes Sent: &#xA0;2,482    Bytes Received: 23,873      The request that seems to be biggest (and apperntly uncached) is: /WebResource.axd?d=vreWgJm8KHsCnZnd2dT3Zg2&amp;t=633067941986250000&#xA0;and it contains javascript functions such as WebForm_PostBackOptions and friends.     For comparision purposes, I have removed the ScriptManager as well:      Request Count: &#xA0;2    Bytes Sent: &#xA0;978    Bytes Received: 2,540     And when it is cached:     Request Count: &#xA0;1    Bytes Sent: &#xA0;554    Bytes Received: 747     As far as I can tell, I am doing everything the way I should do it. But this also means that the issue is with the weight, but the request count. HTTP allows only 2 requests per host, and that means that in cases where just the scripts takes 14 requests, everything else that is Ajaxified will need to wait for them to complete.    The solution for me was to drop the CalendarExtender completely, I went with a simple javascript calendar, it doesn&#x27;t do sliding animations and other cool stuff that the CalendarExtender does, but it doesn&#x27;t kill my site&#xA0;when it is working, either.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have the strong feeling that I am missing something. We have just run into a major slow down in one of our pages, as a result of adding the CalendarExtender. This led me to do some searching, and I am not sure that I can believe the results.    Let us take this simple page:            &lt;%@ Page Language=&quot;C#&quot; AutoEventWireup=&quot;true&quot; CodeBehind=&quot;test.aspx.cs&quot; Inherits=&quot;ExplodingMonkeys.Web.test&quot; %&gt;                                                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;                 &#xA0;&#xA0; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;        &#xA0;                        &lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; &gt;                        &lt;head runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;title&gt;Untitled Page&lt;/title&gt;                        &lt;/head&gt;                        &lt;body&gt;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;form id=&quot;form1&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;asp:TextBox ID=&quot;Date&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot; /&gt;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;/form&gt;                        &lt;/body&gt;                        &lt;/html&gt;        When rendered to the browser, it weight 528 bytes. Now, let us add a &lt;asp:ScriptManager runat=&quot;server&quot;/&gt; to the page. The size of the page exploded to 79 kilobytes, from this change alone.    I then added the following to the page:         &lt;ajax:CalendarExtender runat=&quot;server&quot; TargetControlID=&quot;Date&quot; CssClass=&quot;ClassName&quot; Format=&quot;MMMM d, yyyy&quot;         PopupButtonID=&quot;http://ajax.asp.net/ajaxtoolkit/Calendar/Calendar_scheduleHS.png&quot; /&gt;        The page size reached 143 kilobytes. I am pretty sure that I am missing something here. I enabled both caching and compression in the web config:             &lt;    scriptResourceHandler enableCompression=&quot;true&quot; enableCaching=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;        And then tried again. The results were better, but not really encouraging.    With just script manager: 79 KB (56 KB from cache)    With calendar extender: 143 KB (115 KB from cache)    Just to make it clear, there is a noticable delay on our pages, it went from being instantenous to taking four or five seconds. And I am talking about localhost testing, on powerful machines. (Again that HTTP 2 connections per server issue, I think).    Am I missing something, or are those the real numbers?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was asked this question, and I think that the answer is interesting enough to post here.    There are two sets of technologies that MS is currently pushing.    There is Linq, which is additional support for querying directly from the language, and there is the various ORM efforts that Microsoft is pushing.    When the Linq bits will stabilize to the point where it is viable to start projects using them, there will be support for querying NHibernate with Linq.    I have looked in detailed into the four (or is it five now?) ORM efforts that microsoft is currently pushing, and I am not seeing anything that excites me there.    Early feedback that I got from Microsoft confirmed that even ADO.Net for Entities, which is the only ORM effort that tries to match NHibernate&#x27;s capabilities, is not going to be extensible enough to support what I and my customers needs. This is the usual 80% solution, with a hood welded shut in all the interesting locations.    In addition to this, I find the whole configuration schema to be an order of magnitude more complex than it needs to be, with the additional complexity that this would bring later on when trying to understand what it means.        So no, I do not believe that Microsoft pushing their ORM efforts would have a bad affect on NHibernate, and having Linq would just make our life that much easier.        That said, an ORM that comes from Microsoft is probably going to be popular because it comes from Microsoft. I believe that this will merely confirm for many in the .NET world that ORM is a valid way to work.    The same people that are currently using or evaluating NHibernate will keep it, those that would never use a non Microsoft tool would use the MS ORM. Not that much different from now. People trying to migrate all but the simple projects from NHibernate to MS&#x27; ORM would run into the afore-mentioned brick walls, and would either keep using NHibernate, or would have to invest significant effort porting the application.</p>
