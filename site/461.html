            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that I did, almost by accident, when we started Hibernating Rhinos was to create a CI server and a public daily build server. And every single successful build ended up in customer hands. That was awesome in many respects, it removed a lot of the &#x201C;we have got to make a new release&#x201D; pressure, because we were making new releases, sometimes multiple times a day.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;When we started with RavenDB, it was obvious to me that this was what we were going to do with it as well, because the advantages to this approach as so clear. With RavenDB, we needed a two stage system, but still, every single build gets to the customer hands.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Awesome, great, outstanding, exceptional and other such synonyms. As long as you look at this from one angle, the one in which we are only concerned about the technical challenges of delivering software .The problem is that there are additional things to note here. Economic challenges.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Let us take the profiler as a good example. It was released in beta on the Jan 1, 2009, and since then we had 920 separate builds, adding a ton of new features, capabilities, improving performance, making things smoother and in general making it a better product.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That is over 3 years without a major release, mostly because we never had the need to do this, we kept delivering software on a day to day basis.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;During that time, we delivered features such as viewing the result set, checking the query plan of a query (in all major databases), exporting the entire session to HTML so you can send it to your DBA, CI integration and so much more. It has been wonderful.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Except&#x2026; this has one implications that I didn&#x2019;t think of at the time. If you bought NH Prof on the 1st Jan, 2009 you got 3 years of product updates, for no additional costs. And unless we create a new major version, you can keep using the software, including all the updates and improvements, without paying.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That is great for the very early customers, but not so good for the people who need to eat so they can work on the profiler. Let us think about the implications of this a bit more, okay?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In order for us to actually make money, we have to:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;keep expanding our one-off customer base, which is going to hit a limit at some point.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;create a new version, getting the old customer to purchase the updates.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Seems simple, right? This is what most companies do, and how most software is sold. You get a license for version 1 and you buy a license for version 2.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;So far, so good. But let us consider the implications of that. In order to get the old users to buy the new one, I have to put some really nice stuff in the next version. Which means that I have to do a lot of &#x201C;secret&#x201D; development because I can&#x2019;t just release it on our usual continuous deployment mode. That sucks. And it also means that features that are already coded are actually disabled because we defer them to the next version.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;So, the next version of the profilers is going to have to have some interesting features to get people to buy it. One of them is production profiling. It has actually been around for quite a while. It has simply been #ifdef&#x2019;ed out of the product, because it is something that we keep for the next version.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I just checked, and I was acutely surprised by what I found. The initial work for production profiling was done in Jan 2010, it is working since then. I got side tracked with RavenDB so I never had the chance to actually complete the rest of the features for 2.x and release them all.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In mid 2010 we started experimenting with subscriptions. Instead of having a one time payment model, we moved to a pay as you go. So as long as you were using the profiler, you were paying for it, and in return, we provided all of those new features.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I have been thinking about this a lot lately. I strongly lean toward making the next version of the profiler (coming soon, and it will have a bunch of nice features) subscription only.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;My current thinking it to allow two modes of buying the product. Monthly / yearly subscription and a one time fee that give you 18 months of usage (and doesn&#x2019;t re-charge). That would allow us to keep producing software in incremental steps, without having to go away for a while and work in secret on big ticket features just so we can have enough stuff to put on &#x201C;why you should buy 2.x&#x201D; list.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I would appreciate any feedback that you may have.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my last post, I mentioned that this is actually an event processing system, so we might as well use actual event processing and see what we can gain out of this. I chose to use RX (reactive extensions), which can turn a series of events into a linq statement. This is incredibly powerful, and has some interesting implications when you combine this with your architecture. In particular, let us see what we can get when we set out to replace this with RX based event processing style.  We can get to something like this very easily: public class CargoProcessor : EventsProcessor&#xA;{&#xA;    public CargoProcessor()&#xA;    {&#xA;        On&lt;Cargo&gt;(cargos =&gt;&#xA;            from cargo in cargos&#xA;            where cargo.Delivery.Misdirected&#xA;            select MisdirectedCargo(cargo)&#xA;            );&#xA;&#xA;        On&lt;Cargo&gt;(cargos =&gt;&#xA;            from cargo in cargos&#xA;            where cargo.Delivery.UnloadedAtDestination&#xA;            select CaroArrived(cargo)&#xA;        );&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    private object CaroArrived(Cargo cargo)&#xA;    {&#xA;        // handle event&#xA;        return null;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    private object MisdirectedCargo(Cargo cargo)&#xA;    {&#xA;        // handle event&#xA;        return null;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;We use RX to handle the linq processing over the events, and in EventsProcessor we have very little code, probably just:&#xA;&#xA;    public class EventsProcessor&#xA;    {&#xA;        private readonly List&lt;Func&lt;IObservable&lt;object&gt;, IObservable&lt;object&gt;&gt;&gt;  actions = new List&lt;Func&lt;IObservable&lt;object&gt;, IObservable&lt;object&gt;&gt;&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;        protected void On&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;IObservable&lt;T&gt;, IObservable&lt;object&gt;&gt; action)&#xA;        {&#xA;            actions.Add(observable =&gt; action(observable.OfType&lt;T&gt;()));&#xA;        }&#xA;&#xA;        public void Execute(IObservable&lt;object&gt; observable)&#xA;        {&#xA;            foreach (var action in actions)&#xA;            {&#xA;                action(observable).Subscribe();&#xA;            }&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Elsewhere in the code we setup the actual Obsersable that we pass to all the EventsProcessors. The major advantages that we have with this style is that we have a natural syntax to do selection on the events that interest us, including fairly complex one. We still have easy time of creating new EventsProcessors if we want, but because the code for defining the selection is so compact, we can usually put related stuff together, which is going to be very helpful for making sure that the codebase is readable.&#xA;And, naturally, this method extends itself to handling events of multiple types in the same place. For example, if we want to also handle the HandlingEvent, we can do it in place, because it is very much related to the Cargo, it seems.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here is how it works. I hate benchmarks, because they are very easily manipulated. Whenever I am testing performance stuff, I am posting numbers, but they are usually in reference to themselves (showing improvements). That said&#x2026;  Mark Rodseth .Net Technical Architect at Fortune Cookie in London, UK and he did a really interesting comparison between RavenDB &amp; SQL Server. I feel good about posting this because Mark is a totally foreign agent (hm&#x2026;. well, maybe not that  ) but he has no association with RavenDB or Hibernating Rhinos. Also, this post really made my day.  Update: Mark posted more details on his test case. Mark setup a load test for two identical applications, one using RavenDB, the other one using SQL Server. The results:  SQL Load TestTransactions: 111,014 (Transaction = Single Get Request)Failures: 110,286 (Any 500 or timeout)  And for RavenDB ?   RavenDB Load TestTransactions: 145,554 (Transaction = Single Get Request)Failures: 0 (Any 500 or timeout)   And now that is pretty cool.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post, I spoke about ISP and how we can replace the following code with something that is easier to follow:  I proposed something like: public interface IHappenOn&lt;T&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;   void Inspect(T item);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Which would be invoked using:&#xA;container.ExecuteAll&lt;IHappenOn&lt;Cargo&gt;&gt;(i=&gt;i.Inspect(cargo));&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Or something like that. &#xA;Which lead us to the following code:&#xA;public class CargoArrived : IHappenedOn&lt;Cargo&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;  public void Inspect(Cargo cargo)&#xA;  {&#xA;    if(cargo.Delivery.UnloadedAtDestination == false)&#xA;      return;&#xA;      &#xA;    // handle event&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public class CargoMisdirected : IHappenedOn&lt;Cargo&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;  public void Inspect(Cargo cargo)&#xA;  {&#xA;    if(cargo.Delivery.Misdirected == false)&#xA;      return;&#xA;      &#xA;    // handle event&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public class CargoHandled : IHappenOn&lt;HandlingEvent&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;   // etc&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public class EventRegistrationAttempt : IHappenedOn&lt;HandlingEventRegistrationAttempt&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;  // etc&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But I don&#x2019;t really like this code, to be perfectly frank. It seems to me like there isn&#x2019;t really a good reason why CargoArrived and CargoMisdirected are located in different classes. It is likely that there is going to be a lot of commonalities between the different types of handling events on cargo. We might as well merge them together for now, giving us:&#xA;public class CargoHappened : IHappenedOn&lt;Cargo&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;  public void Inspect(Cargo cargo)&#xA;  {&#xA;    if(cargo.Delivery.UnloadedAtDestination)&#xA;      CargoArrived(cargo);&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;    if(cargo.Delivery.Misdirected)&#xA;      CargoMisdirected(cargo);&#xA;      &#xA;  }&#xA;  &#xA;  public void CargoArrived(Cargo cargo)&#xA;  {&#xA;    // handle event&#xA;  }&#xA;  &#xA;  public void CargoMisdirected(Cargo cargo)&#xA;  {&#xA;    //handle event&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This code put a lot of the cargo handling in one place, making it easier to follow and understand. At the same time, the architecture gives us the option to split it to different classes at any time. We aren&#x2019;t going to end up with a God class for Cargo handling. But as long as it make sense, we can keep them together. &#xA;I like this style of event processing, but we can probably do better job at if if we actually used event processing semantics here. I&#x2019;ll discuss that in my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have found two definitions for ISP (in this post, I assume that you know what ISP is, if you don&#x2019;t, look at the links below). This one I can fully agree with:  Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don&#x27;t use. And this one I strongly disagree with:  Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface For fun, both of those links are from Object Mentor.  It would be more accurate to say that I don&#x2019;t so much disagree with the intent of the second statement, but that I disagree with the wording. One (literal) way of understanding the second statement is to say that we want specific interfaces over generic ones. And I would strongly disagree. An interface is an abstraction (for the most part), and I want to reduce the amount that I have in my system.  Let us look at an example, based on my recent posts in this series.  In my previous post, I said that I want to remove both CargoWasHandled and CargoWasMisdirected in favor of IHappenOnCargoInspection. But what about the two other methods? Would ISP force me to have IHappenOnEventRegistrationAttempt and IHappenOnCargoHandling? Sure, those are many specific interfaces, but are they really better than something like IHappenOn&lt;T&gt;? Is there something truly meaningful that gets lost when we have the generic interface? I would say that this isn&#x2019;t the case, further more, I would actually state that having a single interface will lead to more maintainable code, because there are less abstractions in the code. There is a codebase that is more cohesive and easier to understand. But I&#x2019;ll talk more about cohesion on my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post is in reply to Hadi&#x2019;s post. Please go ahead and read it.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Done? Great, so let me try to respond, this time, from the point of view of someone who regularly asks for patches / pull requests.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here are a few examples.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;To make things more interesting, the project that I am talking about now is RavenDB which is both Open Source and commercial. Hadi says:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Numerous times I&#x2019;ve seen reactions from OSS developers, contributors or merely a simple passer by, responding to a complaint with: submit a patch or well if you can do better, write your own framework. In other words, put up or shut up.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Hadi then goes on to explain exactly why this is a high barrier for most users.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;You need to familiarize yourself with the codebase.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;You need to understand the source control system that is used and how to send a patch / pull request.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And I would fully agree with Hadi that those are stumbling blocks. I can&#x2019;t speak for other people, but in our case, that is the intention.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Nitpicker corner here: I am speaking explicitly and only about features here. Bugs gets fixed by us (unless the user already submitted a fix as well).&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Put simply, there is an issue of priorities here. We have a certain direction for the project that we want to take it. And in many cases, users want things that are out of scope for us for the foreseeable future. Our options then become:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Sorry, ain&#x2019;t going to happen.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Sure, we will push aside all the work that we intended to do to do your thing.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;No problem, we added that to the queue, expect it in 6 &#x2013; 9 months, if we will still consider it important then.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;None of which is an acceptable answer from our point of view.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Case in point, facets support in RavenDB was something that was requested a few times. We never did it because it was out of scope for our plan, RavenDB is a database server, not a search server and we weren&#x2019;t really sure how complex this would be and how to implement this. Basically, this was an expensive feature that wasn&#x2019;t in the major feature set that we wanted. The answer that we gave people is &#x201C;send me a pull request for that&#x201D;.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;To be clear, this is basically an opportunity to affect the direction of the project in a way you consider important. What ended up happening is that Matt Warren took up the task and created an initial implementation. Which was then subject to intense refactoring and finally got into the product. You can see the entire conversation about this here. The major difference along the way is that Matt did all the research for this feature, and he had working code. From there the balance change. It was no longer an issue of expensive research and figuring out how to do it. It was an issue of having working code and refactoring it so it matched the rest of the RavenDB codebase. That wasn&#x2019;t expensive, and we got a new feature in.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is another story, a case where I flat out didn&#x2019;t think it was possible. About two years ago Rob Ashton had a feature suggestion (ad hoc queries with RavenDB). Frankly, I thought that this was simply not possible, and after a bit of back and forth, I told Rob:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Let me rephrase that.&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Dream up the API from the client side to do this.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Rob went away for a few hours, and then came back with a working code sample. I had to pick my jaw off the floor using both hands. That feature got a lot of priority right away, and is a feature that I routinely brag about when talking about RavenDB.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But let me come back again to the common case, a user request something that isn&#x2019;t in the project plan. Now, remember, requests are cheap. From the point of view of the user, it doesn&#x2019;t cost anything to request a feature. From the point of view of the project, it can cost a lot. There is research, implementation, debugging, backward compatibility, testing and continuous support associated with just about any feature you care to name.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And our options whenever a user make a request that is out of line for the project plan are:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Sorry, ain&#x2019;t going to happen.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Sure, we will push aside all the work that we intended to do to do your thing.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;No problem, we added that to the queue, expect it in 6 &#x2013; 9 months, if we will still consider it important then.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Or, we can also say:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;We don&#x2019;t have the resources to currently do that, but we would gladly accept a pull request to do so.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And that point, the user is faced with a choice. He can either:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Oh, well, it isn&#x2019;t important to me.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Oh, it is important to me so I have better do that.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In other words, it shift the prioritization to the user, based on how important that feature is.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We recently got a feature request to support something like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;session.Query&lt;User&gt;()&#xA;   .Where(x=&gt; searchInput.Name != null &amp;&amp; x.User == searcInput.Name)&#xA;   .ToArray();&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I&#x2019;ll spare you the details of just how complex it is to implement something like that (especially when it can also be things like: (searchInput.Age &gt; 18). But the simple work around for that is:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;var q = session.Query&lt;User&gt;();&#xA;if(searchInput.Name != null)&#xA;  q = q.Where(x=&gt; x.User == searcInput.Name);&#xA;&#xA;q.ToArray();&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Supporting the first one is complex, there is a simple work around that the user can use (and I like the second option from the point of view of readability as well).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That sort of thing get a &#x201C;A pull request for this feature would be appreciated&#x201D;. Because the alternative to that is to slam the door in the user&#x2019;s face.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post, I explained why I really don&#x2019;t the following.  public class CargoInspectionServiceImpl : ICargoInspectionService &#xA;{&#xA;  // code redacted for simplicity&#xA;&#xA; public override void InspectCargo(TrackingId trackingId)&#xA; {&#xA;    Validate.NotNull(trackingId, &quot;Tracking ID is required&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;    Cargo cargo = cargoRepository.Find(trackingId);&#xA;    if (cargo == null)&#xA;    {&#xA;      logger.Warn(&quot;Can&#x27;t inspect non-existing cargo &quot; &#x2B; trackingId);&#xA;      return;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    HandlingHistory handlingHistory = handlingEventRepository.LookupHandlingHistoryOfCargo(trackingId);&#xA;&#xA;    cargo.DeriveDeliveryProgress(handlingHistory);&#xA;&#xA;    if (cargo.Delivery.Misdirected)&#xA;    {&#xA;      applicationEvents.CargoWasMisdirected(cargo);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    if (cargo.Delivery.UnloadedAtDestination)&#xA;    {&#xA;      applicationEvents.CargoHasArrived(cargo);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    cargoRepository.Store(cargo);&#xA; }&#xA;}&#xA;Now, let us see one proposed solution for that. We can drop the IApplicationEvents.CargoHasArrived and IApplicationEvents.CargoWasMisdirected, instead creating the following:&#xA;public interface IHappenOnCargoInspection&#xA;{&#xA;   void Inspect(Cargo cargo);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;We can have multiple implementations of this interface, such as this one:&#xA;public class MidirectedCargo : IHappenOnCargoInspection&#xA;{&#xA;   public void Inspect(Cargo cargo)&#xA;   {&#xA;        if(cargo.Delivery.Misdirected == false)&#xA;             return;&#xA;&#xA;        // code to handle misdirected cargo.&#xA;   }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;In a similar fashion, we would have a CargoArrived implementation, and the ICargoInspectionService would be tasked with managing the implementation of IHappenOnCargoInspection, probably through a container. Although I would probably replace it with something like:&#xA;container.ExecuteOnAll&lt;IHappenOnCargoInspection&gt;(i=&gt;i.Inspect(cargo));&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;All in all, it is a simple method, but it means that now the responsibility to detect and act is centralized in each cargo inspector implementation. If the detection of misdirected cargo is changed, we know that there is just one place to make that change. If we need a new behavior, for example, for late cargo, we can do that by introducing a new class, which implement the interface. That gives us the Open Closed Principle. &#xA;This is better, but I still don&#x2019;t like it. There are better methods than that, but we will discuss them in another post.</p>
