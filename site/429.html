            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my Abstract Factory post, I mentioned that I really don&#x2019;t like the pattern, and in particular, code like this:      1: static IGUIFactory CreateOsSpecificFactory()   2: {   3:    string sysType = ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings[&quot;OS_TYPE&quot;];   4:    if (sysType == &quot;Win&quot;)    5:    {   6:        return new WindowsFactory();   7:    }    8:    else    9:    {  10:        return new MacFactory();  11:    }  12: }&#xA;One of the comments mentioned that this might no be ideal, but it is still better than:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: if(RunningOnWindows)   2: {   3:     // code   4: }   5: else if(RunningOnMac)   6: {   7:    // code   8: }   9: else if(RunningOnLinux)  10: {  11:    // code  12: }&#xA;And I agree. But I think that, as the comment mentioned, a far better alternative would be using the container. You can do this using:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: [OperationSystem(&quot;Windows&quot;)]   2: public class WindowsFactory : IGUIFactory   3: {   4: }   5:&#xA0;    6: [OperationSystem(&quot;Linux&quot;)]   7: public class LinuxFactory : IGUIFactory   8: {   9: }  10:&#xA0;   11: [OperationSystem(&quot;Mac&quot;)]  12: public class MacFactory : IGUIFactory  13: {  14: }  15:&#xA0; &#xA;Then you just need to wire things through the container. Among other things, this means that we respect the open / closed principle. If we need to support a new system, we can just add a new class, we don&#x2019;t need to modify code.&#xA;Remember, the Go4 book was written in the age of C&#x2B;&#x2B;. Reflection didn&#x2019;t exists, and that means that a lot of patterns do by hands things that can happen automatically.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The essence of the Abstract Factory method Pattern is to &quot;Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;More about this pattern.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is some sample code:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   1: static IGUIFactory CreateOsSpecificFactory()&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   2: {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   3:     string sysType = ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings[&quot;OS_TYPE&quot;];&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   4:     if (sysType == &quot;Win&quot;) &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   5:     {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   6:         return new WindowsFactory();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   7:     } &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   8:     else &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   9:     {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  10:         return new MacFactory();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  11:     }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA0; 12: }&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I am in two minds about this pattern. On the one hand, we have pretty damning evidence that this has been really bad for the industry at large. For details, you can see Why I Hate Frameworks post. When I first saw that, just shortly after reading the Go4 for the first time, I was in tears from laughing. But the situation he describe is true, accurate and still painful today.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Case in point, WCF suffers from a serious overuse of abstract factories. For example, IInstanceProvider (and I just love that in order to wire that in you usually have to implement IServiceBehavior).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;As the I Hate Frameworks post mentioned:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Each hammer factory factory is built for you by the top experts in the hammer factory factory business, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about all the details that go into building a factory.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Awesome, or not, as the case may be.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Then again, it is a useful pattern. The problem is that in the general case, creating objects that create objects (that create even more objects) is a pretty good indication that your architecture is already pretty hosed.&#xA0; You should strive to an architecture that has minimal amount of levels, and an abstract factory is a whole new level even on its own.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Recommendation: Avoid if you can. If you run into a place where you think that needs this, consider if you can simplify your architecture to the point where this is not required.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Amazon tells me that I purchased this book in Sep 2004, and have since then misplaced it, for some reason. I remember how important this book was to shaping how I thought about software. For the first time, I actually have the words discuss what I was doing, and proven pathways to success. Of course, we all know that&#x2026; it didn&#x2019;t end up being quite so good. In particular, it led to Cargo Cult Programming. From my perspective, it looks like a lot of people made the assumption that their application is good because it has design patterns, not because design patterns will result in simpler code. Now, this book came out in 1994. And quite a bit have changed in the world of software since that time. In this series, I am going to take a look at all those design patterns and see how they hold up in the test of time. Remember, the design patterns were written at a time where most software was single user client applications (think Win Forms, then reduce by nine orders of magnitude), no web or internet, no multi threading, very little networking, very slow upgrade cycles and far slower machines. None of those assumptions are relevant to how we build software today, but they form the core of the environment that was relevant when the book was written. I think that it is going to be interesting to see how those things hold up. And because I know the nitpickers, let me setup the context. We are talking about building design patterns within the context of .NET application, aimed at either system software (like RavenDB) or enterprise applications. This is the context in which I am talking about. Bringing arguments / options from additional contexts is no relevant to the discussion. I am also not going to discuss the patterns themselves at any depth, if you want that, go and read the book, it is still a very good one, even though it came out almost 20 years ago.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, we worked quite a bit on that, but the Uber Prof (NHibernate Profiler, Entity Framework Profiler, Linq to SQL Profiler, etc) version 2.0 are now out for public beta. We made a lot of improvements. Including performance, stability and responsiveness, but probably the most important thing from the user perspective is that we now support running the profiler in production, and even on the cloud. We will have the full listing of all the new goodies up on the company site soon, including detailed instructions on how to enable production profiling and on cloud profiling, but I just couldn&#x2019;t wait to break the news to you. In fact, along with V2.0 of the profilers, we have a brand new site for our company, which you can check here: http://hibernatingrhinos.com/.  To celebrate the fact that we are going on beta, we also offer a 20% discount for the duration of the beta.  Nitpicker corner, please remember that this is a beta, there are bound to be problems, and we will fix them as soon as we can.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In this post, I want to talk about libraries that want or need to not only support being run in multiple threads, but actually want to use multiple threads themselves. Remember, you are a library, not a framework. You are a guest in someone&#x2019;s else home, and you shouldn&#x2019;t litter. The first thing to remember is error handling. That actually comes in two parts. First, unhandled exceptions from a thread will kill the application. There are very few things that people will find more annoying with your library than your errors killing their application. Second, and almost as important, you should have a way to report those errors.  Even more annoying than killing my application, failing to do something silently and in a way that is really hard to debug is going to cause major hair loss all around. There are several scenarios that we need to consider:  Long running threads &#x2013; I need to do something in a background thread that would usually live as long as the application itself. Short term threads &#x2013; I need to do something that requires a lot of threads, just for a short time. Timeouts / delays / expirations &#x2013; I need to do something every X amount of time. In the first case, of long running threads, there isn&#x2019;t much that can be done. You want to handle errors, obviously, and you want to make it crystal clear when you spin up your threads, and when / how you tear them down again. Another important aspect is that you should name your threads. This is important because it means that when debugging things, we can figure out what this or that thread is doing more easily. The next approach is much more common, you just need some way to execute some code in parallel. The easiest thing to do is to go to new Thread(), ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem or Task.Factory.StartNew(). Such, this is easy to do, and it is also perfectly wrong. Why is that, you say? Quite simply, it ain&#x2019;t your app. You don&#x2019;t get to make such decisions for the application that is hosting your library. Maybe the app needs to conserve threads to serve requests? Maybe it is trying to utilize less threads to reduce CPU load and save power on a laptop running on batteries? Maybe they are trying to debug something and all those threads popping around is driving them crazy? The polite thing to do when you recognize that you have a threading requirement in your application is to:  Give the user a way to control that. Provide a default implementation that works. A good example of that can be seen in RavenDB&#x2019;s sharding implementation.  public interface IShardAccessStrategy&#xA;{&#xA;    event ShardingErrorHandle&lt;IDatabaseCommands&gt; OnError;&#xA;&#xA;    T[] Apply&lt;T&gt;(IList&lt;IDatabaseCommands&gt; commands, ShardRequestData request, Func&lt;IDatabaseCommands, int, T&gt; operation);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, we abstracted the notion of making multiple requests. We provide you out of the box with sequential and parallel implementations for this.&#xA;The last item, timeouts /expirations / delays is also something that you want to give the user of your library control of. Ideally, using something like the strategy above. By all means, make a default implementation and wire it without needing anything. &#xA;But it is important to have control over those things. The expert users for your library will want and need it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Next on the agenda for writing correct multi threaded libraries, how do you handle shared state? The easiest way to handle that is to use the same approach that NHibernate and the RavenDB Client API uses. You have a factory / builder / fizzy object that you use to construct all of your state, this is done on a single thread, and then you call a method that effectively &#x201C;freeze&#x201D; this state from now on. All future accesses to this state are read only. This is really good for doing things like reflection lookups, loading configuration, etc. But what happens when you actually need shared mutable state? A common example is a cache, or global statistics. This is where you actually need to pull out your copy of Concurrent Programming on Windows and very carefully write true multi threaded code. It is over a thousand pages, you say? Sure, and you need to know all of this crap to get multi threading working properly. Multi threading is scary, hard and should not be used. In general, even if you actually need to do shared mutable state, you really want to make sure that there are clear definitions between things that can be shared among multiple threads and the things that cannot. And you want to make most of the work in the parts where you don&#x2019;t have to worry about multi threading. It also means that your users have much easier time figuring out what the expected behavior of the system is. This is very important with the advent of C# 5.0, since async API are going to be a lot more common. Sure, you use the underlying async primitives, but did you consider what may happen when you are issuing multiple concurrent async requests. Is that allowed? With C# 5.0, you can usually treat async code as if it was single threaded, but that breaks down if you are allowing multiple concurrent async operations. In RavenDB and NHibernate, we use the notion of Document Store / Session Factory &#x2013; which are created once, safe for multi threading and are usually singletons. And then we have the notion of sessions, which are single threaded, easy &amp; cheap to create and follow the notion of one per thread (actually, one per work unit, but that is beside the point). On my next post, I&#x2019;ll discuss what happens when your library actually wants to go beyond just being safe for multi threading, when the library wants to use threading directly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The major difference between libraries and frameworks is that a framework is something that runs your code, and is in general in control of its own environment and a library is something that you use in your own code, where you control the environment. Examples for frameworks: ASP.Net, NServiceBus, WPF, etc. Examples for libraries: NHibernate, RavenDB Client API, JSON.Net, SharpPDF, etc. Why am I talking about the distinction between frameworks and libraries in a post about multi threaded design? Simple, there are vastly different rules for multi threaded design with frameworks and libraries. In general, frameworks manage their own threads, and will let your code use one of their threads. On the other hands, libraries will use your own threads. The simple rule for multi threaded design for libraries? Just don&#x2019;t do it. Multi threading is hard, and you are going to cause issues for people if you don&#x2019;t know exactly what you are doing. Therefor, just write for a single threaded application and make sure to hold no shared state. For example, JSON.Net pretty much does this. The sole place where it does do multi threading is where it is handling caching, and it must be doing this really well because I never paid it any mind and we got no error reports about it. But the easiest thing to do is to just not support multi threading for your objects. If the user want to use the code from multiple threads, he is welcome to instantiate multiple instances and use one per thread. In my next post, I&#x2019;ll talk about what happens when you actually do need to hold some shared state.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A common complaint from users with RavenDB 1.0 has been that we release too often, which meant that to upgrade RavenDB too often.  We made a clean break with 1.2 (which allowed handle several very large issues cleanly) and we have been releasing unstable version at a steady rate of 5 &#x2013; 8 builds a week.&#xA0; Now, of course, we get complaints about not releasing enough . At any rate, the following is a rough plan for where we will be in the near future. RavenDB 1.2 is currently running in production (running our internal infrastructure) and we have been doing a lot of comparability, stability and performance work. There are still a lot of little tweaks that we still want to put into the product, but major features are likely to be deferred post 1.2 We have just completed triage of the things that we intend to do for 1.2, and we currently have ~60 - 70 items to go through in terms of features to implement, bug fixes to do, etc. Toward the end of this month, we intend to stop all new feature development and focus on bug fixes, stability and performance.&#xA0; By mid Nov, we want to have an RC version out that you can take take out to town, and the release is scheduled to late Nov or early Dec. Post 1.2 release, we will go back to a stable release every 4 - 6 weeks.</p>
