            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the advantages that keeps showing up with leveldb is the notion that it compresses the data on disk by default. Since reading data from disk is way more expensive than the CPU cost of compression &amp; decompression, that is a net benefit. Or is it? In the managed implementation we are currently working on, we chose to avoid this for now. For a very simple reason. By storing the compressed data on disk, it means that you cannot just give a user the memory mapped buffer and be done with it, you actually have to decompress the data yourself, then hand the user the buffer to the decompressed memory. In other words, instead of having a single read only buffer that the OS will manage / page / optimize for you, you are going to have to allocate memory over &amp; over again, and you&#x2019;ll pay the cost of decompressing again and again. I think that it would be better to have the client make that decision. They can send us data that is already compressed, so we won&#x2019;t need to do anything else, and we would still be able to just hand them a buffer of data. Sure, it sounds like we are just moving the cost around, isn&#x2019;t it? But what actually happens is that you have a better chance to do optimizations. For example, if I am storing the data compressing via gzip. And I&#x2019;m exposing the data over the wire, I can just stream the results from the storage directly to the HTTP stream, without having to do anything about it. It can be decompressed on the client. On the other hand, if I have storage level decompression, I am paying for the cost of reading the compressed data from disk, then allocating new buffer, decompressing the data, then going right ahead and compressing it again for sending over the wire.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After taking a look at HyperLevelDB, it is time to see what Basho has changed in leveldb. They were kind enough to write a blog post detailing those changes, unfortunately, unlike HyperLevelDB, they have been pretty general and focused on their own product (which makes total sense). They have called out the reduction of &#x201C;stalls&#x201D;, which may or may not be related to issues with the write delay that leveldb intentionally introduce under load. Okay, no choice about it, I am going to go over the commit log and see if I can find interesting stuff. The first tidbit that caught my eye is improving the compaction process when you have on disk corruption. Instead of stopping, it would move the bad data to the &#x201C;lost&#x201D; directory and move on. Note that there is some data loss associated with this, of course, but that won&#x2019;t necessarily be felt by the users. As a note, I dislike this code formatting:  Like HyperLevelDB, Basho made a lot of changes to compaction, it appears that this is the case for performance reasons:  No compactions triggered by reads, that is too slow. There are multiple threads now handling compactions, with various levels of priorities between them. For example, flushing the immutable mem table is high priority, as is level 0 compaction, but standard compactions can wait. Interestingly, when flushing data from memory to level 0, no compression is used. After those were done, they also added additional logic to enforce locks that would give flushing from memory to disk and from level 0 downward much higher priority than everything else. As an aide, another interesting thing I noticed, Basho also moved closing files and unmmaping memory to a background thread. I am not quite sure why that is the case, I wouldn&#x2019;t expect that to be very expensive. Next on the list, improving caching. Mostly by taking into account actual file sizes and by introducing a reader/writer lock.  Like HyperLevelDB, they also went for larger files, although I think that in this case, they went for significantly larger files than even HyperLevelDB did. Throttling, unlike with HyperLevelDB, where they did away with write throttling altogether in favor of concurrent writes, Basho&#x2019;s leveldb went into a much more complex system of write throttling base on the current load, pending work, etc. The idea is to gain better load distribution overall. (Or maybe they didn&#x2019;t think about the concurrent write strategy). I wonder (but didn&#x2019;t check) if some of the changes were pulled back into the leveldb project. Because there is some code here that I am pretty sure duplicate work already done in leveldb. In this case, the retiring of data that has already been superseded.  There is a lot of stuff that appears to relate to maintenance. Scanning SST files for errors, perf counters, etc. It also look like the decided to go to assembly for actually implementing CRC32. In fact, I am pretty sure that the asm is for calling hardware CRC inside the CPU. But I am unable to decipher that. What I find funny is that another change I just run into is the introduction of a way to avoid copying data when Get()ing data from leveldb. If you&#x2019;ll recall, I pointed that out as an issue a while ago in my first review of leveldb. And here is another pretty drastic change. In leveldb, only level 0 can have overalapping files, but Basho&#x2019;s changed things so the first 3 levels would have overlapping files. The idea is that you can do cheaper compactions this way, I am guessing. I am aware that this is a bit of a mess, with regards to the review, but I just went over the code and wrote down the notes as I saw them. Overall, I think that I like HyperLevelDB changes better, but they have the advantage of using a much later codebase.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, here I am writing some really fun code, when I found out that I am running into dead locks in the code. I activate emergency protocols and went into deep debugging mode. After being really through in figuring out several possible causes, I was still left with what is effectively a WTF @!(*!@ DAMN !(@*#!@* YOU !@*!@( outburst and a sudden longing for something to repeatedly hit. Eventually, however, I figure out what was going on. I have the following method: Aggregator.AggregateAsync(), inside which we have a call to the PulseAll method. That method will then go and execute the following code:      1: public void PulseAll()   2: {   3:     Interlocked.Increment(ref state);   4:     TaskCompletionSource&lt;object&gt; result;   5:     while (waiters.TryDequeue(out result))   6:     {   7:         result.SetResult(null);   8:     }   9: }&#xA;After that, I return from the method. In another piece of the code (Aggregator.Dispose) I am waiting for the task that is running the AggregateAsync method to complete.&#xA;Nothing worked! It took me a while before I figured out that I wanted to check the stack, where I found this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Basically, I had a dead lock because when I called SetResult on the completion source (which freed the Dispose code to run), I actually switched over to that task and allowed it to run. Still in the same thread, but in a different task, I run through the rest of the code and eventually got to the Aggregator.Dispose(). Now, I could only get to it if it the PulseAll() method was called. But, because we are on the same thread, that task hasn&#x2019;t been completed yet!&#xA;In the end, I &#x201C;solved&#x201D; that by introducing a DisposeAsync() method, which allowed us to yield the thread, and then the AggregateAsync task was completed, and then we could move on.&#xA;But I am really not very happy about this. Any ideas about proper way to handle async &amp; IDisposable?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As I mentioned, I run into a very nasty issue with the TPL. I am not sure if it is me doing things wrong, or an actual issue.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Let us look at the code, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We start with a very simple code:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   1: public class AsyncEvent&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   2: {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   3:     private volatile TaskCompletionSource&lt;object&gt; tcs = new TaskCompletionSource&lt;object&gt;();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   4:     &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   5:     public Task WaitAsync()&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   6:     {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   7:         return tcs.Task;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   8:     }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   9:&#xA0; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  10:     public void PulseAll()&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  11:     {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  12:         var taskCompletionSource = tcs;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  13:         tcs = new TaskCompletionSource&lt;object&gt;();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  14:         taskCompletionSource.SetResult(null);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  15:     }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  16: }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This is effectively an auto reset event. All the waiters will be released when the PulseAll it called.

But this cause hangs with a dead lock. Here is why:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Because tasks can share threads, we are in the Background task thread, and we are trying to wait on that background task completion.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Result, deadlock.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;If I add:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   1: await Task.Yield();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Because that forces this method to be completed in another thread, but that looks more like something that you add after you discover the bug, to be honest.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">And&#x2026; this test just passed!  Just to give you some idea, this is sitting on top of RavenDB&#x2019;s implementation of leveldb. In fact, I have been using this code to test out the leveldb implementation. But this actually store all the events, run the aggregation over them and give you the aggregated results. And the entire things works, quite nicely, even if I say so myself.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Starting with build 2603, we are now considering 2.5 to be a release candidate. It is feature frozen, and only bug fixes are going in. You can download the new version here: http://hibernatingrhinos.com/builds/ravendb-unstable-v2.5, and it is also available on nuget as an unstable release. There have been a lot of changes, most of which were recorded on this blog. Next week I&#x2019;ll do a proper post about what is new, but in the meantime, you can check the release notes. I urge you to download it and take it for a spin. We really need feedback from users about how it works, and any problems that you might run into.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It appears that in my previous post I have had an issue with how I read the code. In particular, I looked at the commit log and didn&#x2019;t look at the most recent changes with regards to how HyperLevelDB does the writes. Robert Escriva has been kind enough to point me in the right direction.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The way that this works is a lot more elegant, I think.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;When you want to make a write to a file, you ask for a segment at a particular offset. If we have that offset already mapped, we give it to the caller. Otherwise, we increase the file size if needed, then map the next segment. That part is done under a lock, so there isn&#x2019;t an issue of contention over the end of the file. That is much nicer than the pwrite method.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That said, however, I am still not sure about the issue with the two concurrent transactions. What actually happens here is that while we gained concurrency in the IO, there is still some serialization going on. In other words, even though transaction B was actually flushed to disk before transaction A, it would still wait for transaction A to complete, alleviating the concern that I have had about it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As mentioned earlier, HyperDex has made some changes to LevelDB to make it work faster for their scenarios. I was curious to see what changed, so I took a look at the code. In my previous post, I dealt with compaction, but now I want to deal exclusively with the changes that were made to leveldb to make writes more concurrent.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Update:&#xA0;it appears that I made a mistake in reading the code (I didn&#x27;t check the final version). See this post for the correction.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another change that was made that I am really not sure that I am following is the notion of concurrent log writer. This relies on the pwrite() method, which allows you to write a buffer to a file at a specified position. I have not been able to figure out what is going on if you have concurrent writes to that file. The HyperDex modifications include synchronization on the offset where they will actually&#xA0; make the write, but after that, they make concurrent calls. It make sense, I guess, but I have several problems with that. I was unable to find any details about the behavior of the system when making concurrent calls to pwrite() at the end of the file, especially since your position might be well beyond the current end of file.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what the behavior was supposed to be under those conditions, so I fired up a linux machine and wrote the following code:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   1: int main() {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   2:   char* str1 = &quot;1234\n&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   3:   char* str2 = &quot;5678\n&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   4:   int  file_descriptor;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   5:   int  ret;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   6:   char fn[]=&quot;test&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   7:&#xA0; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   8:   if ((file_descriptor = creat(fn, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR)) &lt; 0)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   9:   {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  10:     perror(&quot;creat() error&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  11:     return -1;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  12:   }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  13:   else {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  14:     ret = pwrite(file_descriptor, str2, 5, 5);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  15:     printf(&quot;Wrote %d\n&quot;, ret);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  16:     &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  17:     ret = pwrite(file_descriptor, str1, 5, 10);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  18:     printf(&quot;Wrote %d\n&quot;, ret);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  19:     &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  20:     if (close(file_descriptor)!= 0)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  21:        perror(&quot;close() error&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  22:     &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  23:   }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  24:   &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  25:   return 0;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;  26: }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I&#x2019;ll be the first to admit that this is ugly code, but it gets the job done, and it told me that you could issues those sort of writes, and it would do the expected thing. I am going to assume that it would still work when used concurrently on the same file.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That said, there is still a problem, let us assume the following sequence of events:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write A&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write B&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write A is allocated range [5 &#x2013; 10] in the log file&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write B is allocated range [10 &#x2013; 5] in the log file&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write B is done and returns to the user&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Write A is NOT done, and we have a crash&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Basically, we have here a violation of durability, because when we read from the log, we will get to the A write, see it is corrupted and stop processing the rest of the log. Effectively, you have just lost a committed transaction. Now, the log format actually allows that to happen, and a sophisticated reader can recover from that, but I haven&#x2019;t seen yet any signs that that was implemented.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;To be fair, I&#xA0;think&#xA0;that the log reader should be able to handle zero&#x27;ed data and continue forward. There is some sort of a comment about that. But that isn&#x27;t supported by the brief glance that I saw, and more importantly, it isn&#x27;t won&#x27;t help if you crashed midway through writing A, so you have corrupted (not zero&#x27;ed) data on the fie. This would also cause the B transaction to be lost.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The rest appears to be just thread safety and then allowing concurrent writes to the log, which I have issue with, as I mentioned. But I am assuming that this will generate a high rate of writes, since there is a lot less waiting. That said, I am not sure how useful that would be. There is still just one physical needle that writes to the disk. I am guessing that it really depends on whatever or not you need the call to be synced or not. If you do, there are going to be a lot more fsync() than before, when it was merged into a single call.</p>
