            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.  More about this pattern. On the face of it, this patterns looks very much like something from the old ages. And indeed, most implementations of Flyweight are actually focused deeply on low memory conditions. I would actually argue that you need to consider very carefully when you want to do that. That said, it is actually used fairly often in high performance places. In the .NET framework, the notion of string interning is one way to get flywieghts (although the problem is that you need to start with a string to get the intern string sort of mess things up). In both the profilers and in RavenDB, we have used variations on the Flyweight pattern. In the profiler, we are mostly dealing with parsing data from the profiled system, and that means doing a lot of reading from a stream and creating objects. That created an unacceptable memory pressure on the system. We implemented a fairly complex system where we can read from the stream into a buffer, then get or create the string from it. We contributed the implementation back to the Protocol Buffers project. You can see the code here. In RavenDB, we deal a lot with documents, and many times we find it useful to be caching a document. The problem with doing that is that you need to return something from the cache, which means that you have to return something mutable. Instead of copying all of the data all the time, the internal RavenDB data structures supports copy-on-write semantics, which means that we can easily create clones at basically no cost. Recommendation: If you are in a perf optimization mode, and you worry about memory pressure, consider using this. Otherwise, like all optimizations, it should be left alone until you have profiler results that says you should consider this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">From a question in the mailing list:  How do you do to &quot;rollback&quot; an entity state supposing the following scenario.public JsonResult Reschedule(string id, DateTime anotherDate)&#xA;{&#xA;            try&#xA;            {&#xA;                var dinner = session.Load&lt;Dinner&gt;(id);&#xA;                dinner.ChangeDate(anotherDate);&#xA;                schedulerService.Schedule(dinner); &#xA;&#xA;                return Json(new { Message = &quot;Bon apetit!&quot; });&#xA;            }&#xA;            catch (DinnerConcurrencyException ex) &#xA;            {&#xA;                return Json(new { Message = ex.Message });&#xA;            }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Base controller&#xA;protected void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext) &#xA;{&#xA;      if(filterContext.Exception != null)&#xA;            return;&#xA;      session.SaveChanges();&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The problem that I have is when the schedulerService throws a DinnerConcurrencyException, it is catched at the controller.&#xA;After all, the OnActionExecuted will call SaveChanges and persist the dinner with an invalid state.&#xA;The next post was:&#xA;&#xA;I have already tried to use Memento Pattern like this:try&#xA;{&#xA;    var dinner = session.Load&lt;Dinner&gt;(id);&#xA;    dinner.SaveState();&#xA;    dinner.ChangeDate(anotherDate);&#xA;    schedulerService.Schedule(dinner); &#xA;&#xA;    return Json(new { Message = &quot;Bon apetit!&quot; });&#xA;}&#xA;catch (DinnerConcurrencyException ex) &#xA;{&#xA;    dinner = dinner.RestoreState();&#xA;    return Json(new { Message = ex.Message });&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But didn&#x27;t work, beacuse I think Raven has proxied my dinner instance.&#xA;And here is the Memento implementation:&#xA;[Serializable]&#xA;public abstract class Entity&#xA;{&#xA;    MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();&#xA;&#xA;    public void SaveState()&#xA;    {&#xA;        new BinaryFormatter().Serialize(stream, this);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public T RestoreState&lt;T&gt;()&#xA;    {&#xA;        stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);&#xA;        object o = new BinaryFormatter().Deserialize(stream);&#xA;        stream.Close();&#xA;&#xA;        return (T)o;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;You might notice that this create a new instance when you call RestoreState, and that has no impact whatsoever on the actual instance that is managed by RavenDB.&#xA;The suggested solution?&#xA;catch (DinnerConcurrencyException ex) &#xA;{&#xA;    SkipCallingSaveChanges = true;&#xA;    return Json(new { Message = ex.Message });&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;No need for patterns here.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I decided to comment to some of the comments in the blog in a full blown post, because they are quite important.  View Model is not a fa&#xE7;ade. It doesn&#x2019;t allow any operation, and it doesn&#x2019;t simplify things. It merely give you an easy access to aggregate information. No, every class is not a Fa&#xE7;ade. I don&#x2019;t care if &#x201C;it provides simplified interface to a larger body of code&#x201D;. If everything is a fa&#xE7;ade, then fa&#xE7;ade is meaningless.  No, Web Request is no a fa&#xE7;ade. Sure, it hides a lot of details about TCP, but that isn&#x2019;t its point. Web Request implements HTTP spec, and that isn&#x2019;t a fa&#xE7;ade at all.  Web Client / Tcp Client / Tcp Listener are facades &#x2013; they drastically simplify how to work with sockets. Good facades, too, because when you need to do more, they don&#x2019;t block you. NHibernate ain&#x2019;t a fa&#xE7;ade &#x2013; it hides ADO.NET, sure, but it also does a lot more then just that. The whole point of this series of posts was not to talk about patterns. If you want to do that, go ahead and read the books. My attempt is to go and talk about how the patterns are actually used. In practice, in real code.  Sure, in the real world, patterns aren&#x2019;t used as per their text book definition. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that we should look at the text book definition. That means that we need to look at how they are actually used! I am not writing a series of posts talking about the problems in the patterns, and that is important. I am writing about the problems in how people use them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A fa&#xE7;ade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.  More about this pattern. The intent of the fa&#xE7;ade was good: to wrap APIs that are poorly designed in something shiny and nice. In the real world, however, it is an evil pattern that is used to needlessly add abstractions for no particular reason. For example, look at this article. &#xA0; That sound you just heard is your architecture, it is hiding in the closet, weeping silent tears about emotional and physical abuse that just doesn&#x2019;t end. I have yet to see a real case were fa&#xE7;ade was actually used properly. In most cases, people built a fa&#xE7;ade because That Is How We Do Things. And because of that, they ended up with things like the one above. It adds exactly nothing, and it horrifyingly complicates the code. Recommendation: Avoid this, you really don&#x2019;t need to do this most of the time, and most implementations are bad.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just got this from a customer, and I think that it is a great story:  Hi Oren,  I thought you might be interested in a little success story!  At the beginning of the year we began pre-financing a pepper factory in the [redacted]. In order to control the money that we were sending to the factory I created a little Excel spread sheet to keep a record of the payments that we were making. However, some payments were made directly from our head office to the factory, and some were made to us in [redacted] which we in turn transferred to the factory. So I added a few more columns to the spread sheet to record this.  However, the repayment calculations are different depending on whether we make the payment in [redacted] or whether it comes from head office. So I added a few more columns to the spread sheet to calculate this. When the money arrives in [redacted], we need to sell the USD at the Central Bank and convert them into [redacted]. So I added a few more columns to the spread sheet to record this.  However, some of the payments that we are transferring to the factory are from money that we borrow locally in [redacted]. So I added a few more columns to record this.&#xA0; The spread sheet is getting quite big now &#x2013; we&#x2019;re at about 30 columns and there&#x2019;s a lot of horizontal scrolling going on. However, we&#x2019;ve only done about 10 operations, so there are only 10 rows. No big deal if we have to scroll around a bit.  Now the factory has started to receive the product which we paid for in advance. Good idea if I add a column to record this. Shit &#x2013; every five minutes, someone comes to me and asks me to add another column for something or other.  OK &#x2013; these are all distinct operations. When the factory starts to ship out the goods, the first page of the spread sheet is at 45 columns, so I now create a new page in the spread sheet to control the shipments as we receive them. Hmm &#x2013; another 30 columns appear &#x2013; of which about a third of them are just references to the first page, and the rest new data.  Now I realize that it would be nice to control our margin on the entire operation. The spread sheet is shared on SkyDrive so that our offices in [redacted] and [redacted], our accountants, our lawyers, the factory and the freight forwarder can see what is going on. However, I can&#x2019;t allow all of these people to see information about our margins, so I create a new hidden page in the spread sheet.  Boy are we successful &#x2013; we&#x2019;ve now done 50 operations. Can&#x2019;t see the column or row headers any more. No worries, just freeze the columns/headers. Wait a minute &#x2013; who the hell copied and pasted the formulas to the new rows? The numbers aren&#x2019;t adding up any more. Duh &#x2013; why did you put the number for the currency contract in against contract 1234 &#x2013; it should have gone against 1235??  Now, I don&#x2019;t want to touch the spread sheet any more for fear of breaking something.  Business is great. We&#x2019;ve finally nailed how to run pre financing operations for pepper factories in [redacted]. We decide to expand our business, and start working with another factory. Since the data in the spread sheet has to be visible to the factory, I create a new spread sheet. However, some of the requirements are slightly different, so it has different columns to the first one.  Our spread sheet is now 85 columns and 60 rows, and the other one is 78 columns and 7 rows.&#xA0; Since the second spread sheet &#x201C;looks&#x201D; almost identical to the first spread sheet &#x2013; yup &#x2013; you guessed it - someone puts information into the wrong spread sheet!  Crisis point &#x2013; we&#x2019;ve got about [redacted, but in the millions US$] out in the field, and we can&#x2019;t work out where the hell the money is &#x2013; are the goods with the farmer, are they at the factory, are they at the port, are they already on board the vessel,&#xA0; has the vessel already left? Have we paid for them, if not, when do we need to pay for them?  All the data is in the spread sheet, but only one person in the entire company really understands it&#xA0; (I just wrote it &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t put the data in). So if I want to know something it&#x2019;s a scream over the desk &#x2013; &#x201C;Jonathan where the **** are the goods we were supposed to ship last week?&#x201D; Jonathan goes on holiday for three weeks.  [redacted] pepper production stops, while Jonathan is going up the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Even at this point &#x2013; if you can believe this &#x2013; I was waiting for him to come back so that we could continue operations.  I&#x2019;ve had enough of this &#x2013; RavenDB to the rescue! Two &#x2013; let me repeat that &#x2013; TWO - hours later, I&#x2019;ve written the scripts to read the spread sheet(s) and throw them into one document &#x2013; I&#x2019;ll repeat that again &#x2013; ONE document.&#xA0;  The document is nicely partitioned into logical groups &#x2013; i.e. classes for Payments, Currency contracts, Shipments etc. There is also a separate class that only does the calculations between the different logical groups. But all of this is stored in one document only. Since the calculations are all obviously read only, the results get persisted to the document.  Two indexes which give me all the information I need to control where the money is, where the stocks are. Three days to write the front end &#x2013; it only took that long because I&#x2019;m still learning MVC and javascript (I really wanted to use Backbone, but just couldn&#x2019;t get my head around it).  In the first analysis of the new application I found [redacted, hundreds of thousands US$] that we had been paid 30 days ago, that we had not sent to the factory, and was lying at the bank!  Now this is where it gets pretty amazing (for me at least). Our data is nicely partitioned, four pages that are simply different views onto the same data. The guys are getting all excited &#x2013; hey I want to control whether we paid the lawyer etc. Someone notices that some of the calculations are not correct &#x2013; so much for my edge case tests!  So I add a couple of new properties to the document, create a three line foreach loop to read all the data in the database and save it straight back again, and voila &#x2013; I&#x2019;ve &#x201C;patched&#x201D; the database. Migrations, shmigrations&#xA0; - who needs them! All the calculations are updated and stored back in the database, the new properties all appear. And this is all on live data. The minute I&#x2019;d got the raw data from the spread sheet into the database we stopped using Excel. And that made my day.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behaviour to be added to an existing object dynamically.  More about this pattern. I don&#x2019;t have a lot to say about this pattern.  The decorator pattern is still just as useful if not more so as the time it was initially announced. It forms a core part of many critical function of your day to day software. The most obvious example is the notion of Stream, where you often decorate a stream (Buffered Stream, Compressing Stream, etc). This example is valid not just for the .NET framework, I can&#x2019;t think of a single major framework that doesn&#x2019;t use the Stream abstraction for its IO. Then again, the cautionary side, people try to use it in&#x2026; strange ways:      1: public abstract class CondimentDecorator : Beverage {}   2:&#xA0;    3: public class Mocha : CondimentDecorator   4: {   5:     private Beverage m_beverage;   6:&#xA0;    7:     public Mocha(Beverage beverage)   8:     {   9:         this.m_beverage = beverage;  10:     }  11:&#xA0;   12:     public override String Description  13:     {  14:         get  15:         {  16:             return m_beverage.Description &#x2B; &quot;, Mocha&quot;;  17:         }  18:     }  19:&#xA0;   20:     public override double Cost()                 21:     {                                        22:         return 0.20 &#x2B; m_beverage.Cost();  23:     }  24: }&#xA;Something like this, for example, is a pretty bad way of doing things. It assumes a very fixed model of looking at the universe, which is just not true. Decorator works best when you have just a single I/O channel. When you have multiple inputs &amp; outputs, decorating something becomes much harder.&#xA;In particular, implementing business logic like the one above in decorators make it very hard to figure out why things are happening. In particular, CachingDecorator is something that you want to avoid (better to use infrastructure or a auto caching proxy, instead).&#xA;Recommendation: It is a very useful pattern, and should be used when you actually have one input / output channel, because that is a great way to allow to dynamically compose the way we apply processing to it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently began to read the &#x201C;indies&#x201D; in the Amazon&#x2019;s listing, and I wanted to point out some things that I really enjoyed: The David Birkenhead series: &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; If I have one complaint about this series, it is that it the books are fairly short, typically less than 200 pages. That said, they are very well written, and the main protagonist is likable almost from the get go.&#xA0; I just noticed that the latest (Commander) came out, and I read it in one sitting.  It is good, really good, military Sci Fi. It is believable, interesting and in general, a lot of fun. The Admiral Who series: &#xA0; In contrast to the Birkenhead series, no one can complain that those books are short. Each comes at around 500 pages or so, and they are filled with a lot of really good content. This is a reluctant hero story, and it reminded me strongly of Mat from the Wheel of Time, just in space.   &#xA0; The problem with most indie content on Amazon is that they are frequently poorly edited. In both cases, however, the editing is pretty good (not perfect, but good enough that it doesn&#x2019;t distract from the story). And the stories more than compensate for that. Just to give you some idea bout how goo they are, I am currently re-reading those books, and that is a honor that many professionally produced books just don&#x2019;t get. The Birkenhead series is supposed to have another book in late October (my thought, it is already late October, any later and it is November!) and while there isn&#x2019;t a release date for the Admiral Who series, I am looking forward to both eagerly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The composite pattern describes that a group of objects are to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to &quot;compose&quot; objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.  More on this pattern. This post is supposed to come on the 1st of Nov or there about, which means that I&#x2019;m going to do a small divergence into politics now. Here is an example of how the upcoming presidential elections in the states.      1: public interface IVotingUnit   2: {   3:     int Weight { get;set; }   4:     int CandidateId { get;set; }   5: }   6:&#xA0;    7: public class Voter : IVotingUnit   8: {   9:     [Obsolete(&quot;Racist&quot;)]  10:     string Id { get;set; }  11:&#xA0;   12:     int Weight { get;set; }  13:&#xA0;   14:     int CandidateId { get;set; }  15: }  16:&#xA0;   17: public class WinnerTakesAllState : IVotingUnit  18: {  19:     string StateCode { get;set; }      20:&#xA0;   21:     int Weight { get;set; }  22:     int CandidateId { get;set; }  23:&#xA0;   24:     public void AddVote(Voter vote){  25:         // calculate  26:     }  27: }&#xA;Yes, this is probably a bad example of this, but I find it hilarious.&#xA0; The basic idea is that you can have an object that represent many other objects, but show the same external interface.&#xA;Composites are usually used for the more CS style of programming. Composites are very common in tree structures such as compiler AST or DOM. But beyond that, I can&#x2019;t easily recall any real world usage of them in my applications. There are usually better alternatives, and you have to remember that when you speak about enterprise applications, loading / storing the data is just as important. And trying to implement the composite pattern under those circumstances will lead to a world of hurt.&#xA;Recommendation: If your entire dataset can easily fit in memory, and it make sense, go ahead. Most of the time, you probably should stay away.</p>
