            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">&#x201C;We can confirm that a large number of instances in a single Availability Zone have lost power due to electrical storms in the area,&#x201D; Amazon reported at 8:30 pm Pacific time on Friday the 29th. Among those servers were RavenHQ-web-1 server (responsible for showing the www.RavenHQ.com marketing site) and RavenHQ-DB-1 (responsible for all the databases located on 1.ravenhq.com).  The reason for that is apparently a big storm that hit the&#xA0; US-East-1 region (Virginia data center). The data center lost power (and no generators were up, somehow) for about 30 minutes which caused extended outage for some of our customers. Small comforts, but we were in the same boat as Netflix, Heroku, Pinterest, and Instagram, among others. Before we dig any deeper. No data was lost, and we resumed normal operations within a few hours. Users with replicated plans had no interruption of service. During the outage, we were in the process of bringing up a new node with all of the databases from the impacted servers, but that would have entailed customers having to change connection strings, and the outage was resolved before we got to that point. I want to show you how RavenHQ is architected from a physical stand point. What you can see isn&#x2019;t actually the servers (those are fairly dynamic) but it is enough for you to get the picture.   In particular, both RavenHQ-web-1 and RavenHQ-db-1 were in US-East-1 region, and were impacted by this issue. The good news is that the rest of our servers were located in different availability regions and were not impacted by the issue. In particular, that was a good stress test (which we could have done without, thank you very much, Amazon&#x2019;s non working generators) for our HA scenario. None of the replicated plans customers experienced much of a problem, we had an auto failover to the secondary server (and depending on your plan, if that would have gone down, the failover would go to the tertiary server, etc). We actually have a customer that has a 4 ways master / master replicated plan, so he is super safe . Unfortunately, that means that any customer that wasn&#x2019;t on a replicated plan and was located on a US-East-1 server felt the impact. Unfortunately, that meant a lot of the free plan customers, since those are predominantly located on that region.&#xA0; As well as a number of actual paying customers. We are sorry for that, and we all understand the need to balance between &#x201C;what happen if&#x201D; and &#x201C;what does it cost&#x201D;. As a result, we are going to offer all existing customers a 25% discount for all replicated plans for the next 6 months. Just contact us and ask for an upgrade to the replicated plan, and we will set it up for you. One of the things that we are trying to do in RavenHQ is really commoditize the notion of a database that is just there, and you worry not about it. Going with the replicated plans is probably the best way to go about doing that, since your data is going to live on at least two physically remote servers, and we have auto failover ready to pop in and support your application if there are any issues. That is why we are offering the discount, as a way to make it even more affordable to go into High Availability mode. Speaking of High Availability, I should probably talk about what happened to www.ravenhq.com, and the answer is fairly simple. The cobbler&#x27;s children go barefoot. We spent a lot of time designing and building RavenHQ to be sustainable in the face of outages, but we focused all of our attention into the actual production instances, we didn&#x2019;t really pay any mind to www.ravenhq.com. As far as we are concerned, this is a marketing site, and it was a low priority for HA story. Unfortunately when we actually had an outage, people really freaked out because www.ravenhq.com was down, even though we had the actual database servers up and running, the website being down gave the impression that all of RavenHQ was down, which was decidedly not the case. Lessons learned  We need to encourage customers to go to the replicated plans by default. They are more expensive,yes, but they are also safer.  We need a better process in the case of outages, to move databases from failed nodes to new ones, and inform customers about this change.  More parts of are actual core infrastructure require to be HA. In particular, we need:   To make sure that authentication works when core servers are missing (wasn&#x2019;t a problem in this particular case, but our investigation revealed that it could be, so we need to solve that).  Ensure that www.ravenhq.com is fully replicated.  Create a /status page, where you can look at the status of the various servers and see how they are acting.  The last two are more for peace of mind than any real production need, but any cloud service runs on trust, and we think that adding those would ensure that if there are any problems in the future, we would be able to provide you with better service.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Some things just piss me off. But before I get to what pissed me off this time, let me set the scene. We usually request from candidates applying for a job in Hibernating Rhinos to submit some piece of code that they wrote. They get additional points if their code is an Open Source project. Some people have some&#x2026; issues with the concept. The replies I got were:  I don&#x2019;t know if I can&#x2019;t send you the code, I&#x2019;ll have to ask my employer. (Which seems really silly thing to do, considering you want to get the code to show it to some other company that you want to hire you). Here is the code, but don&#x2019;t tell anyone. (Those usually get deleted immediately after I send them a scathing reply about things like IP and how important it is to respect that). Here is my last course code. (Which is what actually triggered this post). Here is the deal, if you aren&#x2019;t coding for fun, you are not suitable for a developer position in Hibernating Rhinos. Just to give you some idea, currently we have the following pet projects that I am aware of:  Jewish Sacred Books repository &#x2013; display / commentary Jewish Sacred Books repository &#x2013; search / organization (Note that the two are by two different people and are totally unrelated.) Music game app for Android, iOS and WP7 Personal finance app Auto update library for .NET Various OSS projects And probably other stuff that I am not aware of. (Just for the record, those are things that they are working on their own time, not company time. And not because I or anyone else told them). Why is this relevant? Because I keep getting people who think submitting some random piece of code that they have from their latest university course is a good way to show their mad code skillz. I mean, sure, that might do it, but consider carefully what sort of projects you are usually given as part of university courses. They are usually very small, focusing on just one aspect, and they are totally driven by whatever the crazy professor think is a valid coding standard. Usually, that is NOT a good candidate for sending a code to a job interview. I am going to share just one line from a codebase that I recently got: private void doSwap(ref Album io_Album1, ref Album io_Album2)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The code is in C#, in case you are wondering. And you can probably learn a lot about the state of the codebase from just this line of code. Among my chief complaints:&#xA;&#xA;Violating the .NET framework naming guidelines (method name).&#xA;Violating the .NET framework naming guidelines (argument names).&#xA;Swapping parameters, seriously?! What, are you writing your own sort routine? And yeah, the answer is yes.&#xA;When I pinged the author of the code, he replies that this was because of the course requirements. They had a strict polish notation guidelines, and io_ is for a input &amp; output parameter.&#xA;They had other guidelines (you may not use foreach, for example) that explained some strangeness in the codebase.&#xA;But that isn&#x2019;t really the point. I can understand crazy coding standards, what I can&#x2019;t understand is why someone would submit something that would raise so many red flags so quickly as part of a job application process.&#xA;This is wasting everyone&#x2019;s time. And that is quite annoying.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Update: The issue has been resolved, I&#x2019;ll update on Sunday with full details about this. Some RavenHQ customers may have noticed that they are currently unable to access their RavenHQ databases. The underlying reason is an outage in Amazon US-EAST-1 region, which is where the ravenhq.com server and some of the data base servers are located.  Customers with replicated plans should see no disturbance of service, since this should trigger an automatic failover to the secondary node.  If you have any questions / require support, please contact us via our support forum: http://support.ravenhq.com/ You can see the status report from Amazon below. We managed to restore some service, but then lost it again (because of EBS timeouts, I suspect). We are currently hard at work at bringing up new servers in additional availability zones, and we hope to restore full functionality as soon as possible.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you had sharp eyes, you might have noticed that in this code, I am actually using two different sessions:  We have the GeoSession, and we have the RavenSession. The GeoSession is actually pointed at a different database, and it is a read only. In fact, here is how we use this:  As you can see, we create this on as needed basis, and we only dispose it, we never actually call SaveChanges().  So, those are the technical details, but what is the reasoning behind this? Well, it is actually pretty simple. The GeoIP dataset is about 600 MB in size, and mostly it is about&#x2026; well, geo location stuff. It is a very nice feature, but it is a self contained one, and not something that I really care for putting inside my app database. Instead, I have decided to go another way, and use a separate database. That means that we have separation, at the data layer, between the different databases. It makes sense, about the only thing that we need from the GeoIP dataset is the ability to handle queries, and that is expressed only via GetLocationByIp, nothing more. I don&#x2019;t see a reason to make the app database bigger and more complex, or to have to support updates to the GeoIP dataset inside the app. This is a totally separate service. And having this in a separate database make it much easier to use this the next time that I want to use geo location. And it simplify my life right now with regards to maintaining and working with my current app. In fact, we could have taken it even further, and not use RavenDB access to this at all. We can use REST calls to get the data out directly. We have chosen to still use the RavenDB Client, I&#x2019;ll discuss exactly why we chose not to do that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got word about a&#xA0; port of Nerd Dinner to RavenDB, Dinner Party (source, live demo), and I just had to check the code.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I reviewed Nerd Dinner itself in the past: Part I, Part II, so it is extra fun to see what happens when you move this to RavenDB. Note that at this point, I haven&#x2019;t even looked at the code yet.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is the actual project (Just one project, I wholeheartedly approve):&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Hm&#x2026; where is the controllers folder?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Oh, wait, this isn&#x2019;t an ASP.NET MVC application, it is a NancyFX application. I never actually look into that, so this should be interesting. Let us see if I can find something interesting, and I think we should look at the bootstrapper first.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;There are several interesting things happening here. First, the application uses something called TinyIoC, which I am again, not familiar with. But it seems reasonable, and here is how it is initialized:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9; protected override void ApplicationStartup(TinyIoC.TinyIoCContainer container, Nancy.Bootstrapper.IPipelines pipelines)&#xA; {&#xA;     base.ApplicationStartup(container, pipelines);&#xA;&#xA;     DataAnnotationsValidator.RegisterAdapter(typeof(MatchAttribute), (v, d) =&gt; new CustomDataAdapter((MatchAttribute)v));&#xA;&#xA;     Func&lt;TinyIoCContainer, NamedParameterOverloads, IDocumentSession&gt; factory = (ioccontainer, namedparams) =&gt; { return new RavenSessionProvider().GetSession(); };&#xA;     container.Register&lt;IDocumentSession&gt;(factory);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;     CleanUpDB(container.Resolve&lt;IDocumentSession&gt;());&#xA;&#xA;     Raven.Client.Indexes.IndexCreation.CreateIndexes(typeof(IndexEventDate).Assembly, RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore);&#xA;     Raven.Client.Indexes.IndexCreation.CreateIndexes(typeof(IndexUserLogin).Assembly, RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore);&#xA;     Raven.Client.Indexes.IndexCreation.CreateIndexes(typeof(IndexMostPopularDinners).Assembly, RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore);&#xA;     Raven.Client.Indexes.IndexCreation.CreateIndexes(typeof(IndexMyDinners).Assembly, RavenSessionProvider.DocumentStore);&#xA;&#xA;     pipelines.OnError &#x2B;= (context, exception) =&gt;&#xA;     {&#xA;         Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(exception);&#xA;         return null;&#xA;     };&#xA; }&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;All of which looks fine to me, except that I seriously don&#x2019;t like the injection of the session. Why?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Because it means that if you have two components in the same request that needs a session, each will get his own session, instead of having a session per request. It also means that you can&#x2019;t implement the &#x201C;call SaveChanges() when the request is done without error&#x201D; pattern, but that is more of a pet peeve than anything else.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another thing to note is the multiple calls to IndexCreation.CreateIndexes. Remember, we have just one assembly here, and CreateIndexes operate on the assembly level, not on the individual index level. All of those can be removed but one (and it doesn&#x2019;t matter which).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Lastly, we have the CleanupDB part. Dinner Party runs on Azure, and make use of RavenHQ. In order to stay within the limit of the RavenHQ free database, Dinner Party will do cleanups and delete old events if the db size goes over some threshold.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Okay, let us see where the real stuff is happening, and it seems to be happening in the Modules directory. I checked the HomeModule first, and I got:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public class HomeModule : BaseModule&#xA;{&#xA;    public HomeModule()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Get[&quot;/&quot;] = parameters =&gt;&#xA;        {&#xA;            base.Page.Title = &quot;Home&quot;;&#xA;&#xA;            return View[&quot;Index&quot;, base.Model];&#xA;        };&#xA;&#xA;        Get[&quot;/about&quot;] = parameters =&gt;&#xA;        {&#xA;           &#xA;            base.Page.Title = &quot;About&quot;;&#xA;&#xA;            return View[&quot;About&quot;, base.Model];&#xA;        };&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I was worried at first about Page.Title (reminded me of ASPX pages), but it is just a default model that is defined in BaseModule. It is actually quite neat, if you think about it, check it out:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Before &#x2B;= ctx =&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    Page = new PageModel()&#xA;    {&#xA;        IsAuthenticated = ctx.CurrentUser != null,&#xA;        PreFixTitle = &quot;Dinner Party - &quot;,&#xA;        CurrentUser = ctx.CurrentUser != null ? ctx.CurrentUser.UserName : &quot;&quot;,&#xA;        Errors = new List&lt;ErrorModel&gt;()&#xA;    };&#xA;&#xA;    Model.Page = Page;&#xA;&#xA;    return null;&#xA;};&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I assume that Model is shared between Module and View, but I will check it shortly. I like how you can expose it to the view dynamically and have a strongly typed version in your code.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And yes, confirmed, the views are just Razor code, and they look like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Okay, enough with playing around, I&#x2019;ll need to investigate NancyFX more deeply later on (especially since it can do self hosting), but right now, let us see how this is using RavenDB.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Let us start with the DinnerModule, a small snippet of it can be found here (this is from the ctor):&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;const string basePath = &quot;/dinners&quot;;&#xA;&#xA;Get[basePath &#x2B; Route.AnyIntOptional(&quot;page&quot;)] = parameters =&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;&#xA;    base.Page.Title = &quot;Upcoming Nerd Dinners&quot;;&#xA;    IQueryable&lt;Dinner&gt; dinners = null;&#xA;&#xA;    //Searching?&#xA;    if (this.Request.Query.q.HasValue)&#xA;    {&#xA;        string query = this.Request.Query.q;&#xA;&#xA;        dinners = DocumentSession.Query&lt;Dinner&gt;().Where(d =&gt; d.Title.Contains(query)&#xA;                || d.Description.Contains(query)&#xA;                || d.HostedBy.Contains(query)).OrderBy(d =&gt; d.EventDate);&#xA;    }&#xA;    else&#xA;    {&#xA;        dinners = DocumentSession.Query&lt;Dinner, IndexEventDate&gt;().Where(d =&gt; d.EventDate &gt; DateTime.Now.Date)&#xA;            .OrderBy(x =&gt; x.EventDate);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    int pageIndex = parameters.page.HasValue &amp;&amp; !String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(parameters.page) ? parameters.page : 1;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    base.Model.Dinners = dinners.ToPagedList(pageIndex, PageSize);&#xA;&#xA;    return View[&quot;Dinners/Index&quot;, base.Model];&#xA;&#xA;};&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I am not sure that I really like this when you effectively have methods within methods, and many non trivial ones.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The code itself seems to be pretty nice, and I like the fact that it makes use of dynamic in many cases to make things easier (for Query or to get the page parameter).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But where does DocumentSession comes from? Well, it comes from PersistentModule, the base class for DinnerModule, let us take a look at that:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public class PersistModule : BaseModule&#xA;{&#xA;    public IDocumentSession DocumentSession&#xA;    {&#xA;        get { return Context.Items[&quot;RavenSession&quot;] as IDocumentSession; }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public PersistModule()&#xA;    {&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public PersistModule(string modulepath)&#xA;        : base(modulepath)&#xA;    {&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And now I am confused, so we do have session per request here? It appears that we do, there is a RavenAwareModuleBuilder, which has the following code:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;if (module is DinnerParty.Modules.PersistModule)&#xA;{&#xA;    context.Items.Add(&quot;RavenSession&quot;, _ravenSessionProvider.GetSession());&#xA;    //module.After.AddItemToStartOfPipeline(ctx =&gt;&#xA;    //{&#xA;    //    var session =&#xA;    //        ctx.Items[&quot;RavenSession&quot;] as IDocumentSession;&#xA;    //    session.SaveChanges();&#xA;    //    session.Dispose();&#xA;    //});&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I withdraw my earlier objection. Although note that the code had at one point automatic session SaveChanges(), and now it no longer does.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another common pet issue in the code base, there is a lot of code that is commented.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Okay, so now I have a pretty good idea how this works, let us see how they handle writes, in the Dinner case, we have another class, called DinnerModuleAuth, which is used to handle all writes.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is how it looks like (I chose the simplest, mind):&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Post[&quot;/delete/&quot; &#x2B; Route.AnyIntAtLeastOnce(&quot;id&quot;)] = parameters =&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        Dinner dinner = DocumentSession.Load&lt;Dinner&gt;((int)parameters.id);&#xA;&#xA;        if (dinner == null)&#xA;        {&#xA;            base.Page.Title = &quot;Nerd Dinner Not Found&quot;;&#xA;            return View[&quot;NotFound&quot;, base.Model];&#xA;        }&#xA;&#xA;        if (!dinner.IsHostedBy(this.Context.CurrentUser.UserName))&#xA;        {&#xA;            base.Page.Title = &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own This Dinner&quot;;&#xA;            return View[&quot;InvalidOwner&quot;, base.Model];&#xA;        }&#xA;&#xA;        DocumentSession.Delete(dinner);&#xA;        DocumentSession.SaveChanges();&#xA;&#xA;        base.Page.Title = &quot;Deleted&quot;;&#xA;        return View[&quot;Deleted&quot;, base.Model];&#xA;    };&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;My only critique is that I don&#x2019;t understand why we would need to explicitly call SaveChanges instead.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Finally, a bit of a critique on the RavenDB usage, the application currently uses several static indexes: IndexEventDate, IndexMostPopularDinners, IndexMyDinners and IndexUserLogin.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The first three can be merged without any ill effects, I would create this, instead:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public class Dinners_Index : AbstractIndexCreationTask&lt;Dinner&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    public Dinners_Index()&#xA;    {&#xA;        this.Map = dinners =&gt;&#xA;                   from dinner in dinners&#xA;                   select new&#xA;                   {&#xA;                       RSVPs_AttendeeName = dinner.RSVPs.Select(x =&gt; x.AttendeeName),&#xA;                       RSVPs_AttendeeNameId = dinner.RSVPs.Select(x =&gt; x.AttendeeNameId),&#xA;                       HostedById = dinner.HostedById,&#xA;                       HostedBy = dinner.HostedBy,&#xA;                       DinnerID = int.Parse(dinner.Id.Substring(dinner.Id.LastIndexOf(&quot;/&quot;) &#x2B; 1)),&#xA;                       Title = dinner.Title,&#xA;                       Latitude = dinner.Latitude,&#xA;                       Longitude = dinner.Longitude,&#xA;                       Description = dinner.Description,&#xA;                       EventDate = dinner.EventDate,&#xA;                       RSVPCount = dinner.RSVPs.Count,&#xA;                   };&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This serve the same exact function, but it only has one index. In general, we prefer to have bigger and fewer indexes than smaller and more numerous indexes.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post, I mentioned that I don&#x2019;t like this code, that it lacked an important *ities, and I asked what was the problem with it.  The answer is that it isn&#x2019;t easily debuggable. Consider the case where we have a support call from a user &#x201C;I am in France but I see courses that are running in Australia&#x201D;. How do you debug something like that, and how can you work with the user on that. In this case, adding something like this is enough to make the system much nicer to work with under those scenarios:  This is an internal detail, never expose externally (until this blog post, obviously), but it allows us to override what the system is doing. We can actually pretend to be another user and see what is going on. Without the need of actual debugging any code. That means that you can try things out, in production. It means that you don&#x2019;t have to work hard to replicate a production environment, get all of the&#xA0; production data and so on. Thinking like that is important, it drastically reduces your support burden over time.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, all of this have gone quite far. We have seen that we can quite easily go from having the user&#x2019;s IP address to figuring out its location using our Geo Location database. The next step is to actually do something about it. Usually, when doing geo location, you care to know what the human readable name for the user&#x2019;s location is, but in our case, what we most care about is the user&#x2019;s physical location, so it is lucky that the geo location database that we found also include longitude and latitude information. With that, we can define the following index, on our events. The Longitude &amp; Latitude information is actually calculated by the browser using the Google Geocoder API, so we just plug in the address, and the site does the rest by figuring out where on the globe we are. This index allows us to search by spatial query as well as by time:  Using that, we can do:  First, we try to find the location of the user based on the user IP, then we are making a spatial query on top of the events, based on the user location. What we are doing essentially is asking, &#x201C;show me the next 2 future events within 200 miles of the user&#x2019;s location&#x201D;. Just a tiny little bit of code, but it produces this:  And hopefully, this will narrow things down for you to the obvious: &#x201C;Of course I am going to the next RavenDB Course&#x201D;!</p>
