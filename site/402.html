            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We have an outage that appears to have taken roughly 12 hours. The reason it took so long to fix, it was after business hours, and while we have production support for our clients, we never hooked up our own websites to our own system. A typical case of the barefoot shoemaker. The reason for the outage? Also pretty typical:  The reason for that? We had a remote backup process that put some temp files and didn&#x2019;t clean them up properly. The growth rate was about 3-6 MB a day, so no one really noticed. The fix:   All is working now, I sorry for the delay in fixing this. We&#x2019;ll be having some discussion here to see how we can avoid repeat issues like that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is another post on the &#x201C;learning to code&#x201D; series. Mostly because I think that this is an important distinction. The way I learn something new, I usually try to construct a mental model of how it works in the simplest terms, then I learn to use it, then I dig into the actual details of how it works. The key here is that the results of the first part is usually wrong. It is a lie, but it is a good lie, in the sense that it give me the ability to gloss over details in order to understand how things are really working. It is only when I understand how something is used and under what scenarios that I can really appreciate the actual details. A good example of that are things like:  Memory Garbage Collection Network If you ever wrote C, you are familiar with the way we can just allocate memory and use it. The entire system is based on the idea that it looks to you like you have full access to the entire system, and that one piece of memory is pretty much the same as anything else. It is a great mental model to go with, even if it is completely wrong. Virtual memory, OS paging, CPU cache lines are all things that really mess up with that model when you get down to really understanding how this works. So the model that you have in your head (and probably still do, unless you need to think about high perf code). The way most people think GC works is probably based on John McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine&quot; and/or George E. Collins&#x27; &quot;A method for overlapping and erasure of lists&quot;, both from 1960. While those set the basis for GC in general, there is a lot more going on, and modern GC systems work quite differently. But it is enough to get by. And networking have this whole 7 level OSI model:  And very rarely do people need to think beyond the next layer down. We might think that we viewing a web page, and then break it down to the list of requests made, but we usually stop at that level. It is easy to just consider what happens as magical, but you sometimes need to figure out what is going on in the next layer down, how the packets are actually broken up for transports. An example of that is when you run into issues with Nagle&#x2019;s algorithm.  But trying to learn REST, for example, by focusing on the format of IPv4 vs. IPv6 packets is a non starter. We need to know just enough to understand what is going on. We are usually good with just thinking about the movement of data as just happening. Of course, later on we would need to revisit that to have better understanding of the stack. But that is usually not relevant. So we tell ourselves a little lie and move on. As an example of when those lies comes to bite us in the ass is the Fallacies Of Distributed Computing. But for the most part, I am really in favor of dedicating just enough time to figure out a good lie and move of to the real task. Of course, it has to be a good lie. A really good one was the Ptolemaic model of the universe:  It might be wrong, but it was close enough for the things that you needed doing.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Casey asked me:  Any tips on how to read large codebases - especially for more novice programmers? As it happens, I think that this is a really great question. I think that part of what makes someone a good developer is the ability to go through a codebase and figure out what is going on. In your career you are going to come into an existing project and be expected to pick up what is going on there. Or, even more nefarious, you may have a project dumped in your lap and expected to figure it out all on your own. The worst scenario for that is when you are brought in to replace &#x201C;those incontinent* bastards&#x201D; that failed the project, and you are expected to somehow get things working. But another common scenarios for this include being asked to maintain a codebase written by a person who left the company. And finally, of course, if you are using any Open Source projects, there is a strong likelihood that you&#x2019;ll be asked to &#x201C;can you extend this to also do this&#x201D;, or maybe you are just curious. Especially for novice programmers, I would strongly recommend that you&#x2019;ll do just that. See the rest of the post for actual details on how I do that, but do go ahead and read code. I usually approach new codebases with a blind eye toward documentations / external details. I want to start without preconceptions about how things are working. I try to figure out the structure of the project from the on disk structure. That alone can tell you a lot. I usually try to figure out the architecture from that. Is there a core part of the system? How is it split, etc. Then I find the lowest level part of the code just start reading it. Usually in blind alphabetical order. Find a file, read it all the way, next file, etc. I try to keep notes (you can see some examples of those in the blog) about how things are hooked together, but mostly, I am trying to get a feel for the code. There is a lot of code that is usually part of the project style, it can be things like precondition checks, logging, error handling, etc. Those things you can learn to recognize early and then can usually just skip them to read the interesting&#xA0; bits.  I usually don&#x2019;t try to read too deeply at this point, I am trying to get a feeling about the scope of things. This file is responsible for X and do so by calling Y &amp; Z, but it isn&#x2019;t really important to me to know every little detail at that point. Oh, and I keep notes, a lot of notes. Usually they aren&#x2019;t really notes but more a list of questions, which I fill / answer as I understand more. After going through the lowest level I can find, I usually try to do a vertical slice. Again, this is most so I can figure out how things are laid out and working. That means that the next time that I am going to go through this, I&#x2019;ll have a better idea about the structure / architecture of this. Next, I&#x2019;ll usually head to the interesting bits. The part of the system that make it interesting to me rather than something that is off the shelve.  That is pretty much it, there isn&#x2019;t much to it. I am pretty much just going over the code and trying to first find the shape &amp; structure, then I dive into the unique parts and figure out how they are made.  In the meantime, especially if this is hard, I&#x2019;ll try to go over any documentation exists, if any. At this point, I should have a much better idea about how things are setup that I&#x2019;ll be able to really go through the docs a lot more quickly. * I started writing incompetent, but this is funnier.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">On the 5th on November, I am going to be doing a talk in Skills Matter London. In this talk I am going to talk about LevelDB, LMDB and storage internals. I am going to cover how we built Voron, the next generation storage engine for RavenDB, the design decisions that we made and the things we took from other codebases that we looked in. Expect a low level talk filled with details about how to implement ACID and transactions, how to optimize reads and writes. Pitfalls in building storage engines, and a lot of details that comes from several years of research into this area. Yes, it will be recorded, but you probably want to come anyway. It is a talk I&#x2019;ve been dying to give for the last 3 months, and I got some goodies to share.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As I mentioned, there is one scenario which produce worse &amp; worse performance for LMDB, random writes. The longer the data set, the more expensive the cost. This is due to the nature of LMDB as a Copy On Write database. Here is a simple explanation of what is the cost: We want to update the value in the red square.   Because the tree is Copy On Write, we need to modify the following pages:  An as the tree goes deeper, it becomes worse. Naturally, one consequence of doing random writes is tree fragmentation. In my tests, on a small 1 million records dataset we would get a cost of over hundred pages (roughly 4 MB) to update a hundred 16 &#x2B; 100 bytes values. Just to clarify, those tests were done on the LMDB code, not on Voron. So I am pretty sure that this isn&#x2019;t my problem. Indeed, I confirmed that this is a general problem with COW approach. I accepted that, and the benefits that we get are significant enough to accept that. But&#x2026; I never really was complete in my acceptance. I really wanted a better way. And after adding Write Ahead Log to Voron, I started thinking. Is there a reason to continue this? We are already dealing with writing to the log. So why modify the entire tree? Here is how it looks like:  Now, when you are looking at the tree, and you ask for the B page, you&#x2019;ll get the one in the log. However, older transactions would get to see the B page in the data file, not the one in the log. So we maintain MVCC.  This complicates matters somewhat because we need to sync the data file flushing with existing transactions (we can&#x2019;t flush the file until all transactions have progressed to the point where they look at the new pages in the log), but that is something that we have to do anyway. And that would cut down the amount of writes that we have to do by a factor of ten, according to my early estimation. Hell, this should improve write performance on sequential writes. For that matter, look what happens when we need to split page D:  Here we need to touch the tree, but only need to touch the the immediate root. Which again, gives us a lot of benefits in the size we need to touch.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Kelly Sommers has been commenting about transactional model on twitter.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&quot;Fully ACID writes but BASE reads&quot; - Go back to the books. You can&#x27;t selectively opt out of guarantees as you wish. What can client observe?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And some other things in the same vien. I am going to assume that this is relevant for RavenDB, based on other tweetss from her. And I think that this requires more space than allowed on twitter. The gist of Kelly&#x27;s argument, as I understand it, is that RavenDB isn&#x27;t ACID because it does BASE reads.&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I am not sure that I am doing the argument justice, and it is mostly pieced together from a whole bunch of tweets, so I would love to see a complete blog post about it. However, I think that at least with regards to RavenDB, there is a major misconception going on here.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;RavenDB is an ACID database, period. If you put data in, you can be sure that the data will be there and you can get it out again. Indeed, the data you put in is immediately consistent. There is no scenario in which you can do any sequence of read/write/read/write and not immediately get the last committed state for that server. What I think is confusing people is the fact that we have implemented BASE queries. So let us go back a bit and discuss that.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Internally, RavenDB is structure as a set of components. One of those components in the document store, which is responsible for... storing documents (and a lot more besdie, but that isn&#x27;t very important right now). The document store is ACID. And it ensure consistency, MVCC, durability, and all that other good stuff.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The document store is also limited in the kind of queries that it support. In effect, it supports only the following:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Document by key&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Document by key prefix&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Documents by update order&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;When talking about ACID, I am talking about this part of the system, in which you are writing documents and loading them by their id or by update order.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Note that in RavenDB, we use the term &quot;load&quot; to refer to accessing the document store. That is probably the cause for confusion. Loading is never inconsistent and obeys a strict snapshot isolation interpretation of the data. That means that asking something like: &quot;give me users/123&quot; is always going to give you the immediately consistent result.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In constrast to that, RavenDB also have the index store. The index store allows us to create complex queries, and that is subject to eventual consistency. That is by design, and a large part of what makes RavenDB able to dynamically adjust its own behavior at runtime based on production usage.&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We have a separate background processes that apply the indexes to the incoming data, and write them to the actual index store. This is done in direct contrast to other indexing systems (for example, RDBMS) in which indexes are updated as part of the same transaction. That leads to several interesting results.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Indexes aren&#x27;t as expensive - In RDBMS, the more indexes you have, the slower your writes become. In RavenDB, indexes have no impact on the write code path,. That means that you can have a lot more indexes without worrying about it too much. Indexes still have cost, of course, but in most system, you just don&#x27;t feel it.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Lock free reads &amp; writes&#xA0;- Unlike other databases, where you have to pay the indexing cost either on write (common) or read (rare), with RavenDB both read &amp; writes operate without having to deal with the indexing cost. When you make a query, we will immediately give you an answer from the results that we have right now. When you perform a write, we will process that without waiting for indexing.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Dynamic load balancing - because we don&#x27;t promise immediate consistency, we can detect and scale back our indexing costs in time of high usage. That means that we can shift resources from indexing to answering queries or accepting writes. And we will be able to pick up the slack when the peek relaxes.&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Choice&#xA0;- one of the things that we absolutely ensure is that we will tell you when you make a query and we give you results that might not be up to date. That means that when you get the reply, you can make an informed decision. &quot;This query is the result of all the data in the index as of 5 seconds ago&quot; - decide if this is good enough for you or if you want to wait. Unlike other systems, we don&#x27;t force you to accept whatever consistency model you have. You get to choose if you want to answers I can give you right now, or if you want to wait until we can give you the conistent version, that is up to you.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Smarter indexes - under the hood, RavenDB uses lucene for indexes. Even without counting things like full text or spatial searches, we get a lot more than what you get from the type of indexes you are used to in other systems.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;For example, from the MongoDB docs (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/index-compound/):&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;db.events.find().sort( { username: -1, date: 1 } )&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;The following index can support both these sort operations:&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;db.events.ensureIndex( { &quot;username&quot; : 1, &quot;date&quot; : -1 } )&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;However, the above index cannot support sorting by ascending&#xA0;username&#xA0;values and then by ascending&#xA0;date&#xA0;values, such as the following:&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;db.events.find().sort( { username: 1, date: 1 } )&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In constrant, in RavenDB, it is sufficent that you just tell us what you want to index, and you don&#x27;t need to worry about creating two indexes (and paying twice the price) if you want to allow users to sort the grid in multiple directions.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;On the fly optimiaztions&#xA0;- the decision to separate the document store and the index store to separate components has paid off in ways that we didn&#x27;t realy predict. Because we have the sepration, and because indexes are background processes that don&#x27;t really impact the behavior of the rest of the system (outside of resources consumed), we have the freedom to do some interesting things. One of them is live index rebuild.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That means that you can create an index in RavenDB, and the system would go ahead and create it. At the same time, all other operations will go on normally. It can be writes to the document store, it can be updates to the other indexes. Anything at all.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Just to give you some idea about this feature, you&#x27;ll note that this feature exists only in the Enterprise edition for SQL Server, for example.&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And the implications of that are that we&#xA0;can&#xA0;actually create an index in production. In fact, we do so routinely, that is the basis of our ad hoc querying ability. We analyze the query, the query optimizer decides where to dispatch it, and will&#xA0;create the new index if that is needed. There is a whole host of behavior just in this one feature (optimizations, heuroistics, scale back, etc) that we can do, but for the most part, you don&#x27;t care. You make queries to the server. RavenDB analyze them and product the most efficent indexes to match you&#xA0;actual production load&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;.Anyway, I am starting to go on about RavenDB, and that is rarely short. So I&#x27;ll summarize. RavenDB is composed of two distinct parts, the ACID document store, which allow absolute immediate consistency for both reads &amp; writes. And it also have the index store, which is eventually consistent, updated in the background and are always available for queries. They&#x27;ll also do zero waits (unless you explicitly desire this) for you and give you a much better and more consistent performance.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Oh, and a final number to conclude. The average time between a document update in the document store and the results showing up in the index store? That is 23ms*.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;(And I blame 15.6ms of that on the clock resolution).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There are 6 major features for RavenDB 3.0 that we want to keep as surprises. One of them you&#x27;ve already learned about, the HTML5 studio. And we&#x27;ll reveal the others as they become viable to show.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But leaving those major features aside, there is a lot of stuff that we are doing that would deserve a bullet point all on its own. And today I want to talk about one of those features, S2S Smuggling.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Basically, assume that you have a server at location P (for Production) and you want to get the state of this server to your database at location D (for development). Right now, you have to export the P database, copy the file to your own machine and import it. That isn&#x27;t a major hassle, but it&#xA0;is&#xA0;a hassle.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Instead, in RavenDB 3.0, you can go to a server, point it to another server and just see the data streaming by. We even suppose doing this multiple times, and only the changes will be moved between the servers.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Yes, you can do that right now with the replication bundle. But not all databases are replicated, and it is simpler and easier to just move the documents as if there is nothing there.&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The general idea is to be more&#xA0;convenient, but it is also likely to be much faster than the current method of: server &gt; file, copy file, file &gt; server. If only because we can do two way streaming, and plug the outgoing data directly into a bulk insert pipe.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We got a support request from a customer, and this time it was quite a doozie. The were using the FreeDB dataset as a test bed for a lot of experiments, and they found very slow indexing speed with it.&#xA0; In fact, what they found was utterly unacceptable indexing speed, to be frank. It took days to complete. However, that run contrary to all of the optimizations that we have done in the past few years. So something there was quite fishy. Luckily, it was fairly simple to reproduce. And the culprit was very easily identified. It was the SQL Replication Bundle. But why? That turned out to be a pretty complex answer.&#xA0;  The FreeDB dataset currently contains over 3.1 million records, and the sample the customer send us had about 8 indexes, varying in complexity from the trivial to full text analyzed and map reduce indexes. We expect such work load plus the replication to SQL to take a while. But it should be pretty fast process.  What turned out to be the problem was the way the SQL Replication bundle work. Since we don&#x2019;t know what changes you are going to replicate to SQL, the first thing we do is to delete all the data that might have previously been replicated. In practice, it means that we execute something like: DELETE FROM Disks WHERE DocumentId in (@p1, @p2, @p3)&#xA;&#xA;INSERT INTO Disks (...) VALUES( ... )&#xA;INSERT INTO Disks (...) VALUES( ... )&#xA;INSERT INTO Disks (...) VALUES( ... )&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And over time, this became slower &amp; slower. Now, SQL Replication need access to a lot of documents (potentially all of them), so we use the same prefetcher technique that we use for indexing. And we also use the same optimizations to decide how much to load.&#xA;However, in this case, we had the SQL Replication being slow, and because we use the same optimization, to the optimizer it looked like we were having a very slow index. That calls for reducing the load on the server so we can have greater responsiveness and to reduce overall resource utilization. And that impacted the indexes. In effect, SQL Replication being slow forced us to feed the data into the indexes in small tidbits, and that drastically increased the I/O costs that we had to pay.&#xA;So the first thing to do was to actually break it apart, we now have different optimizers instances for indexes and SQL Replication (and RavenDB Replication, for that matter), and they cannot impact one another.&#xA;But the root cause was that SQL Replication was slow. And I think you should be able to figure out why from the information outline above.&#xA;As we replicated more and more data into SQL, we increased the table size. And as we increased the table size, statements like our DELETE would take more and more time. SQL was doing a lot of table scans.&#xA;To be honest, I never really thought about it. RavenDB in the same circumstances would just self optimize and thing would get faster fast. SQL Server (and any other relational database) would just be dog slow until you came and added the appropriate index.&#xA;Once that was done, our performance was back on track and we could run things speedily both for indexes and for SQL Replication.</p>
