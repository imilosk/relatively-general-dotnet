            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The title of this post is pretty strange, I admit. Usually, when we think about modeling, we think about our data. If it is a relational database, this mostly mean the structure of your tables and the relations between them. When using a document database, this means the shape of your documents. But in both cases, indexes are there merely to speed things up. Oh, a particular important query may need an index, and that may impact how you lay out the data, but these are relatively rare cases. In relational databases and most non relational ones, indexes do not play any major role in data modeling decisions.This isn&#x2019;t the case for RavenDB. In RavenDB, an index doesn&#x2019;t exist merely to organize the data in a way that make it easier for the database to search for it. An index is actually able to modify and transform the data, on the current document or full related data from related documents. A map/reduce index is even able aggregate data from multiple documents as part of the indexing process. I&#x2019;ll touch on the last one in more depth later in this series, first, let&#x2019;s tackle the more obvious parts. Because I want to show off some of the new features, I&#x2019;m going to use JS for most of the indexes definitions in these psots, but you can do the same using Linq / C# as well, obviously.When brain storming for this post, I got so many good ideas about the kind of non obvious things that you can do with RavenDB&#x2019;s indexes that a single post has transformed into a series and I got two pages of notes to go through. Almost all of those ideas are basically some form of computation during indexing, but applied in novel manners to give you a lot of flexibility and power.RavenDB prefers to have more work to do during indexing (which is batched and happen on the background) than during query time. This means that we can push a lot more work into the background and just let RavenDB handle it for us. Let&#x2019;s start from what is probably the most basic example of computation during query, the Order&#x2019;s Total. Consider the following document:As you can see, we have the Order document and the list of the line items in this order. What we don&#x2019;t have here is the total order value. Now, actually computing how much you are going to pay for an order is complex. You have to take into account taxation, promotions, discounts, shipping costs, etc. That isn&#x2019;t something that you can do trivially, but it does serve to make an excellent simple example and similar requirements exists in many fields. We can obvious add an Total field to the order, but then we have to make sure that we update it whenever we update the order. This is possible, but if we have multiple clients consuming the data, this can be fairly hard to do. Instead, we can place the logic to compute the property in the index itself. Here is how it would look like:The same index in JavaScript is almost identical:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

We can query on this field, sort it and even project it back (if this field is stored). It allow us to always have the most up to date value and have the database take care of computing it. This basic technique can be applied in many different ways and affect the way we shape and model our data. Currently I have at least three more posts planned for this series, and I would love to hear your feedback. Both on the kind of stuff you would like me to talk about and the kind of indexes you are using RavenDB and how it impacted your data modeling.</p>

This basically does the setup for a TCP listener and setting up of the TLS details so we can accept a connection.Rust allows us to define local functions (inside a parent function), this is mostly just a way to define a private function, since the nested function has no access to the parent scope. The open_cert_file function is just a way to avoid code duplication, but it is an interesting one. It is a generic function that accepts an open ended function of its own. Basically, it will open a file, read it and then pass it to the function it was provided. There is some error handling, but that is pretty much it.The next fun part happens when we want to read the certs and key file. The certs file is easy, it can only ever appear in a single format, but the key may be either PKCS8 or RSA Private Key. And unlike the certs, where we expect to get a collection, we need to get just a single value. To handle that we have:First, we try to open and read the file as a RSA Private Key, if that isn&#x2019;t successful, we&#x2019;ll attempt to read it as PKCS8 file. If either of those attempts was successful, we&#x2019;ll try to get the first key, clone it and return.&#xA0; However, if there was an error in any part of the process, we abort the whole thing (and exit the function with an error).From my review of Rust code, it looks like this isn&#x2019;t non idiomatic code, although I&#x2019;m not sure I would call it idiomatic at this point.&#xA0; The problem with this code is that it is pretty fun to write, when you read it is obvious what is going on, but it is really hard to actually debug this. There is too much going on in too little space and it is not easy to follow in a debugger. The rest of the code is boring, so I&#x2019;m going to skip that and start talking about why client authentication is going to be interesting. Here is the core of the problem:In order to simplify my life, I&#x2019;m using the rustls&#x2019; Stream to handle transparent encryption and decryption. This is similar to how I would do it when using C#, for example. However, the stream interface doesn&#x2019;t have any way for me to handle this explicitly. Luckily, I was able to dive into the code and I think that given the architecture present, I can invoke the handshake manually on the ServerSession and then hand off the session as is to the stream.What I actually had to do was to setup client authentication here:And then manually complete the handshake first:And this is when I run into a problem, when trying to connect via my a client certificate, I got the following error:I&#x2019;m assuming that this is because rustls is actually verifying the certificate against PKI, which is not something that I want. I don&#x2019;t like to use PKI for this, instead, I want to register the allowed certificates thumbprints, but first I need to figure out how to make rustls accept any kind of client certificate. I&#x2019;m afraid that this means that I have to break out the debugger again and dive into the code to figure out where we are being rejected and why&#x2026;After a short travel in the code, I got to something that looks promising:This looks like something that I should be able to control to see if I like or dislike the certificate. Going inside it, it looks like I was right:I think that I should be able to write an implementation of this that would do the validation without checking for the issuer. However, it looks like my plan run into a snag, see:I&#x2019;m not sure that I&#x2019;m a good person to talk about the details of X509 certificate validation. In this case, I think that I could have done enough to validate that the cert is valid enough for my needs, but it seems like there isn&#x2019;t an way to actually provide another implementation of the ClientCertVerifier, because the entire package is private. I guess that this is as far as I can use rustls, I&#x2019;m going to move to the OpenSSL binding, which I&#x2019;m more familiar with and see how that works for me.Okay, I tried using the rust OpenSSL bindings, and here is what I got:So this is some sort of link error, and I could spend half a day to try to resolve it, or just give up on this for now. Looking around, it looks like there is also something called native-tls for Rust, so I might take a peek at it tomorrow.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Most developers have been weaned on relational modeling and have to make a non trivial mental leap when the times comes to model data in a non relational manner. That is hard enough on its own, but what happens when the data store that you use actually have multi model capabilities. As an industry, we are seeing more and more databases that take this path and offer multiple models to store and query the data as part of their core nature. For example, ArangoDB, CosmosDB, Couchbase, and of course, RavenDB.&#xA;RavenDB, for example, gives you the following models to work with:&#xA;&#xA;Documents (JSON) &#x2013; Multi master with any node accepting reads and writes.&#xA;&#xA;ACID transactions over multiple documents.&#xA;Simple / full text queries.&#xA;Map/Reduce and aggregation queries.&#xA;&#xA;Binary data &#x2013; Attachments to documents.&#xA;Counters (Map&lt;string, int64&gt;) &#x2013; CRDT multi master distributed counters.&#xA;Key/Value &#x2013; strong distributed consistency via Raft protocol.&#xA;Graph queries &#x2013; on top of the document model.&#xA;Revisions &#x2013; built in audit trail for documents&#xA;&#xA;With such a wealth of options, it can be confusing to select the appropriate tool for the job when you need to model your data. In this post, I aim to make sense of the options RavenDB offers and guide you toward making the optimal choices.&#xA;The default and most common model you&#x2019;ll use is going to be the document model. It is the one most appropriate for business data and you&#x2019;ll typically follow the Domain Driven Design approach for modeling your data and entities. In other words, we are talking about Aggregates, where each document is a whole aggregate. References between entities are either purely local to an aggregate (and document) or only between aggregates. In other words, a value in one document cannot point to a value in another document. It can only point to another document as a whole.&#xA;Most of your business logic will be focused on the aggregate level. Even when a single transaction modify multiple documents, most of the business logic is done at each aggregate independently. A good way to handle that is using Domain Events. This allow you to compose independent portions of your domain logic without tying it all in one big knot.&#xA;We talked about modifying documents so far, but a large part of what you&#x2019;ll do with your data is query and present it to users. In these cases, you need to make a conscious and explicit decision. Whatever your display model is going to be based on your documents or a different source. You can use RavenDB ETL to project the data out to a different database, changing its shape to the appropriate view model along the way. RavenDB ETL allow you to replicate a portion of the data in your database to another location, with the ability to modify the results as they are being sent. This can be a great tool to aid you in bridging the domain model and the view model without writing a lot of code.&#xA;This is useful for applications that have a high degree of complexity in their domain and business rules. For most applications, you can simply project the relevant data out at query time, but for more complex systems, you may want to have strict physical separation between your read model and the domain model. In such a scenario, Raven ETL&#xA0; can greatly simplify the task of facilitating the task of moving (and transforming) the data from the write side to the read side.&#xA;When it comes to modeling, we also need to take into account RavenDB&#x2019;s map/reduce indexes. These allow you to define aggregation that will run in the background, in other words, at query time, the work has already been done. This in turn leads to blazing fast aggregation queries and can be another factor in the design of the system. It is common to use map/reduce indexes to aggregation the raw data into a more usable form and work with the results. Either directly from the index or use the output collection feature to turn the results of the map/reduce index to real documents (which can be further indexes, aggregated, etc).&#xA;Thus far, we have only touched on document modeling, mind. There are a bunch of other options as well. We&#x2019;ll start from the simplest option, attachments. At its core, an attachment is just that. A way to attach some binary data to the document. As simple as it sounds, it has some profound implications from a modeling point of view. The need to store binary data somewhere isn&#x2019;t new, obviously and there have been numerous ways to resolve it. In a relational database, a varbinary(max) column is used. In a document database, I&#x2019;ve seen the raw binary data stored directly in the document (either as raw binary data or as BASE64 encoded value). In most cases, this isn&#x2019;t a really good idea. It blow up the size of the document (and the table) and complicate the management of the data. Storing the data on the file system lead to a different set of problems, coordinating transactions between the database and the file system, organizing the data, securing paths such as &#x201C;../../etc/passwd&#x201D;, backups and restore, and many more.&#xA;Attachments&#xA;These are all things that you want your database to handle for you. At the same time, binary data is related to but not part of the document. For those reasons, we use the attachment model in RavenDB. This is meant to be viewed just like attachments in email. The binary data is not stored inside the document, but it is strongly related to it. Common use cases for attachments include profile picture for a user&#x2019;s document, the signatures on a lease document, the excel spreadsheet with details about a loan for a payment plan document or the associated pictures from a home inspection report. A document can have any number of attachments, and an attachment can be of any size. This give you a lot of freedom to attach (pun intended) additional data to your documents without any hassle. Like documents, attachments also work in multi master mode and will be replicated across the cluster with the document.&#xA;Counters&#xA;While attachments can be any raw binary data and has only a name (and optional mime type) for structure, counters are far more strictly defined. A counter is&#x2026; well, a counter. It count things. On the most basic level, it is just a named 64 bits integer that is associated with a document. And like attachments, a document may have any number of such counters. But why is it important to have a 64 bits integer attached to the document? How could something so small can be important enough that we would need a whole new concept for it? After all, couldn&#x2019;t we just store the same counter more simply as a property inside the document?&#xA;To understand why RavenDB have counters, we need to understand what they aren&#x2019;t. The are related to the document, but not of the document. That means that an update to the counter is not going to modify the document as a whole. This, in turn, means that operations on the counters can be very cheap, regardless of how many counters you have in a document or how often you modify the counter. Having the counter separate from the document allow us to do several important things:&#xA;&#xA;Cheap updates&#xA;Distributed modifications&#xA;&#xA;In a multi master cluster, if any node can accept any write, you need to be aware of conflicts, when two updates to the same value were made on two disjoint servers. In the case of documents, RavenDB detect and resolve it according to the pre-defined policy. In the case of counters, there is no such need. A counter in RavenDB is stored using a CRDT. This is a format that allow us to handle concurrent modifications to the same value without losing data or expensive locks. This make counter suitable for for values that changes often. Good examples of counters is tracking views on a page or an ad, you can distribute the operations on a number of servers and still reach the correct final tally. This works both for increment and decrement, obviously.&#xA;Given that counters are basically just map&lt;string, int64&gt; you might expect that there isn&#x2019;t any modeling work to be done here, right? But it turns out that there is actually quite a bit that can be done even with that simple an interface. For example, when tracking views on a page or downloads for a particular package, I&#x2019;m interested not only in the total number of downloads, but also in the downloads per day. In such a case, whenever we want to note another download, we&#x2019;ll increment both the counter for overall download and another counter for downloads for that particular day. In other words, the name of the counter can hold meaningful information.&#xA;Key/Value&#xA;So far, all the data we have talked about were stored and accessed in a multi-master manner. In other words, we could chose any node in the cluster and make a write to it and it would be accepted. Data that is modified on multiple nodes at the same time would either be merged (counters), stored (attachments) or resolved (documents). This is great when you care about the overall availability of your system, we are always accepting writes and always proceed forward. But that isn&#x2019;t always the case, there are situations where you might need to have a higher degree of consistency in your operations. For example, if you are selling a fixed number of items, you want to be sure that two buyers hitting &#x201C;Purchase&#x201D; at the same time don&#x2019;t cause you problems just because their requests used different database servers.&#xA;In order to handle this situation, RavenDB offers the Cmp Xcng model. This is a cluster wide key/value store for your database, it allows you to store named values (integer, strings or JSON objects) in a consistent manner. This feature allow you to ensure consistent behavior for high value data. In fact, you can combine this feature with cluster wide transactions.&#xA;Cluster wide transactions allow you to combine operations on documents with Cmp Xcng ops to create a single consistent transaction. This mode enable you to perform conditional operations to modify your documents based on the globally consistent Cmp Xcng values.&#xA;A good example for Cmp Xcng values include pessimistic locks and their owners, to generate a cluster wide lock that is guaranteed to be consistent and safe regardless of what is going on with the cluster. Other examples can be to store global configuration for your system in all the nodes in the cluster.&#xA;Graph Queries&#xA;Graph data stores are used to hold data about nodes and the edges between them. They are a great tool to handle tasks such as social network, data mining and finding patterns in large datasets. RavenDB, as of release 4.2, has support for graph queries, but it does so in a novel manner. A node in RavenDB is a document, quite naturally, but unlike other features, such as attachments and counters, edges don&#x2019;t have separate physical existence. Instead, RavenDB is able to use the document structure itself to infer the edges between documents. This dynamic nature means that when the time comes to apply graph queries on top of your existing database, you don&#x2019;t have to do a lot of prep work. You can start issuing graph queries directly, and RavenDB will work behind the scenes to make sure that all the data is found, and quickly, too.&#xA;The ability to perform graph queries on your existing document structure is a powerful one, but it doesn&#x2019;t alleviate the need to model your data properly to best take advantage of this. So what does this mean, modeling your data to be usable both in a document form and for graph operations? Usually, when you need to model your data in a graph manner, you think mostly in terms of the connection between the nodes.&#xA;One way of looking at graph modeling in RavenDB is to be explicit about the edges, but I find this awkward and limiting. It is usually better to express the domain model naturally and allow the edges to pop up from the underlying data as you work with it. Edges in RavenDB are properties (or nested objects) that contain a reference to another document. If the edge in a nested object, then all the properties of the object are also the properties on the edge and can be filtered upon.&#xA;For best results, you want to model your edge properties as a single nested object that can be referred to explicitly. This is already a best practice when modeling your data, for better cohesiveness, but graph queries make this a requirement.&#xA;Unlike other graph databases, RavenDB isn&#x2019;t limited to just graph representation. A graph queries in RavenDB is able to utilize the full power of RavenDB queries, which means that you can start your graph operation with a spatial query and then proceed to the rest of the graph pattern match. You should aim to do most of the work in the preparatory queries and not spend most of the time in graph operations.&#xA;A common example of graph operation is fraud detection, with graph queries to detect multiple orders made using many different credit card for the same address. Instead of trying to do the matches using just graph operations, we can define a source query on a map/reduce index that would aggregate all the results for orders on the same address. This would dramatically cut down on the amount of work that the database is required to do to answer your queries.&#xA;Revisions&#xA;The final topic that I want to discuss is this (already very long) post is the notion of Revisions. RavenDB allow the database administrator to define a revisions policy, in which case RavenDB will maintain, automatically and transparently, an immutable log of all changes on documents. This means that you have a built-in audit trail ready for use if you need to. Beyond just having an audit trail, revisions are also very important feature in several key capabilities in RavenDB.&#xA;For example, using revisions, you can get the tuple of (previous, current) versions of any change made in the database using subscriptions. This allow you to define some pretty interesting backend processes, which have full visibility to all the changes that happen to the document over time. This can be very interesting in regression analysis, applying business rules and seeing how the data changes over time.&#xA;Summary&#xA;I tried to keep this post at a high level and not get bogged down in the details. I&#x2019;m probably going to have a few more posts about modeling in general and I would appreciate any feedback you may have or any questions you can raise.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Next week is CodeMash, in Ohio. I&#x2019;m going to be at the conference and I have a talk about extreme performance architecture. I&#x2019;m going to try to condense in 45 minutes the lessons that took us a decade to learn and almost two years to implement. That should be fun, but as much as I enjoy speaking, it is the first time in a while that I&#x2019;m actually going to go to a conference, not just be there at the booth, and that is really exciting for me.I took a look at the schedule and there are some interesting workshops and sessions. Without any particular order, here are the things that popped out as stuff that I would like to be atBTW, to the CodeMash people, not being able to link directly to the sessions is a PITA.Workshops:Up &amp; Running with Graph Databases - Greg Jordan &#x2013; I would love to get a feel to how things are looking from the side consuming the graph API, not the one implementing it. If all goes well, I might do a series of posts on the exercises in the workshop as it pertains to RavenDB.CodeMash CryptoParty - Dusty Burwell &#x2013; I have a love/hate relationship with cryptography. I find it fascinating but the math is usually beyond me,&#xA0; so I can&#x2019;t understand it (that&#x2019;s a joke).Sessions:Making and Baking an Application Security Department - Bill Sempf &#x2013; Following up on the crypto party, this is an are that I care deeply about, so it is worth the 8AM timeslot to learn more about this. I&#x2019;m also interested in how I can, as an infrastructure, meaningfully contribute to the application overall security.7 Reasons why your microservices should use Event Sourcing &amp; CQRS - Hugh McKee &#x2013; I&#x2019;m familiar with both CQRS and microservices, but putting them together seems interesting. I&#x2019;m mostly wondering about the data flow paths in such a system as the data is required on multiple servers.&quot;Did you get my message?&quot; - A comparison of several modern messaging platforms - Jack Bennett &#x2013; This is very close to what I usually do, and I went over ZeroMQ&#x2019;s code a few time, so that would be interesting.Building a better audit log - Craig Hills &#x2013; this is a pain point in many cases, what to log and how, and the tension between logging too much and too little.Database DevOps with Containers - Rob Richardson &#x2013; I think that my interest in this one is pretty obvious .Bluetooth Prototyping with the Raspberry Pi &#x2013; I&#x2019;m using my Raspberry Pis to run clusters of database servers, I wonder if there are other possible uses for a 25$ machine&#x2026;&#xA;Extreme Performance Architecture - Oren Eini &#x2013; I&#x2019;m giving this talk, so I guess I gotta. Pivot: How to proceed when things don&#x27;t work out - Jay Harris &#x2013; This is in the same timeslot as I&#x2019;m speaking at, but I would have like to listen to it. Failure, planning for failure and recovering from it are all very important skills.ZAPping Security Vulnerabilities in Your Development Pipeline - Matthew Smith &#x2013; This seems like it would be a session that cover an eminently useful skill.My users posted what? - Harold Pulcher &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t have a direct use for the topics discussed here, but it seems interesting, and I like learning for leaning sake. At some future time, it always pays off.APIs on the Scale of Decades - Gary Fleming - RavenDB is ten years old, and I&#x2019;m certainly feeling the pressure there.THE STORIES OF THE MOST INFAMOUS BUGS - Ian Zelikman &#x2013; Because who doesn&#x2019;t want to see a clown slip on a banana peel, and this is the high tech equivalent. Data management in a Microservices world - Gerald Venzl &#x2013; This is a topic that I have been thinking a lot about, and more information there would be very useful.Patterns and Architectures Beyond Microservices - Stephen Shary &#x2013; should be interesting, some of the patterns that are mentioned in the description aren&#x2019;t known to me and I have to exert some willpower not to search for them and wait for the session.Post Mortem: Dealing with Failure in Development - BJ Burns &#x2013; Already said that this is an important topic, so this session is also very intereseting.Building A Highly Scalable Service that Survived A Super Bowl - Keith Elder &#x2013; Because if nothing else, the story is likely going to be awesome.Comments are Useless and Other Controversial Opinions About Code - Izzi Bikun &#x2013; This sounds like a fun session.There are a lot of other stuff there that looks good, and I don&#x2019;t even know if I&#x2019;ll be able to get through all these sessions (not actually possible, there are timing conflicts between some of them). But the point of the conference isn&#x2019;t just to sit in the sessions but the hallway interactions and actually talking with people.I&#x2019;m looking forward to that and I&#x2019;m bringing a few books and some swag as well, if anyone is there and is interested. I&#x2019;m really looking forward to it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The next interesting step in my Rust network protocol exercise is to implement TLS. I haven&#x2019;t looked at that yet, so it is going to be interesting.The first search for &#x201C;Rust TLS&#x201D; gives me the rustls project, which seems to provide a native Rust implementation. There are also native-tls, which uses the system TLS library and binding for OpenSSL. I&#x2019;m not sure how trust worthy rustls is, but I&#x2019;m building a network protocol that is meant as an exercise, so I don&#x2019;t really care.

I&#x2019;m kinda proud / kinda scared of this code. It is packed. But on the other hand, if you read it, it is fairly clear, it is just that it does a lot of stuff.I then used this in the following way:And that led to this error when using OpenSSL to connect to it:On the rust side, it died with:The good thing, both sides agree that there is a handshake issue, but I had no idea what was going on. The bad thing, I have no clue why this is failing. According to the docs, this is supposed to work. I tried debugging into rustls and it seems to be failing very early in the handshake process, but I&#x2019;m not familiar enough with either Rust or TLS to really understand why. The core issues seems to be here:Note that we get a payload of None, but when I&#x2019;m debugging through the code in the read_version method, it seems like it returns properly.Oh, I figured it out, the issue is here:Note the highlighted section? If this returns a None, it will silently return from the method. It is easy to miss something like that. Digging (much) deeper, I found:And deeper still, we have:Go back a bit and see what kind of URL I gave to OpenSSL, it was 127.0.0.1, and it seems like rustls doesn&#x2019;t support raw IPs, only hostnames. The limit seems to be the result of this code:This seems to be a known error, it is opened since May 2017 and it is a completely deal breaker for me. I&#x2019;m guessing that this isn&#x2019;t a big issue in general because usually if you have a cert, it is for a hostname and certificates for IPs (which exists, but tend to be issued for private CAs) are far rarer.I changed my cmd line to use:And it started working, but at that point, I was debugging this issue for over an hour, so that is quite enough for today.As an aside, I was able to attach to the rust process using Visual Studio and debug it fairly normally. There is some weirdness that I believe relates to the cleanup, where if you abort a method early it looks like it goes back in time until it exit the method. However, overall it works fairly nicely. I do have to point out that many of the nicer features in the language are making debugging much harder.That said, once thing was absolutely amazing and it was the fact that I was so easily debug into my dependencies, in fact, I was changing the code of my dependencies and re-running it, to help me narrow down exactly where the error was. That was easy, obvious and worked. Very nice!</p>
