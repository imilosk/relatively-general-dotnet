            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Recently I have posted a few contentional posts, to which some people responded by explaining me the same reasoning that I talked about in the post. I would like to point out that if I already detailed the problem in the post, I am probably aware of it, and I think that this is the wrong approach despite those reasons.    There is a difference between understanding the reasoning behind something, and agreeing with it. I can follow the argument to its logical conclusion, and still not agree with the end result.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">But still start using it now. Another reply to Adi, this time a new post in which he clarifies what he meant before. The main idea is that Microsoft&#x27;s products get a big mindshare regardless of their relative qualities. I do not doubt that this is true, a lot of people goes for Microsoft because it is Microsoft. Expecting that this will pay off in the future is still the wrong thing to do.    I am one of those that would move to a new technology just because it gives me a tiny bit more, if it preserves everything that I can do in my current technologies. I am now using MsBuild in favor of Nant, because I can get the build script and the VS project to match (and yes, I know I can call msbuild from Nant). I moved to NUnit from MbUnit and back again, for much the same reasons.     But if it doesn&#x27;t improve, why bother?&#xA0; Adi brings up a couple of examples:Team system is relatively new, but I bet in while more people will be doing unit tests using it, and not NUnit, even if NUnit is better.    I will refuse to use MS Test until:            It has a performance on par with NUnit/MbUnit - currently aroudn 30% slower, clock time.            It support the very basic of test patterns, Abstract Test Class.            It can be run as part of the build without jumping through hops.    There are people that would use MS Test instead of using NUnit, I am sure, although you don&#x27;t here about it almost at all. They make compromises because they are using Microsoft, compromises that I am not willing to make.Once Linq is out, I think the same would be true regarding NHibernate.    Linq is an extention to the language, not a technology. Assuming that Adi is talking about one of the ORM technologies from Microsoft, I do not think that I can argue that this is the case, only that I do not think that this is something that is done with planning and foresight. Just to point out, no one answered to my Linq challange yet, and I have no idea if this is even possible.I wrote about the wonder MS did releasing C# and conquering a big chunk of the market, and Oren reply was &quot;Just to point out, another company did, Sun &amp; Java&quot;. But Sun introduces something new to the world with Java, while that was not the case with C#.    I started doing C# when I was mostly building Windows applications. The only good story at the time was VB or C&#x2B;&#x2B;. If you wanted to use Java you could, if you really liked laying stuff out in code, and then running it to see what you wanted. Java was never very strong on the client. C# came to replace a market that was dying for a replacement, which is why it caught such a big audiance in such a short time. If Sun had its act together in 95-00, it could have made Java&#xA0;the prevasive technology everywhere. That leads me to the strategy part - MS related technology is a good bet because you can be sure most of the market will use it.    I would really love to compete on a technology level with someone that is buying completely into this approach. I can do better than most of the market by using the best tools for the job. Limiting myself to Microsoft tools is limiting myself to the level that Microsoft believes most programmers should be.    I once had to resort to runtime code generation in order to sort a grid view. It is complex, yes, but it meant that I had sorting working for all the grids in the application, for the cost of half a day, while the upstream team wrote custom code per grid per page, because that is how they were told it should work.    Going with MS related technology blindly is not a good thing at all. It is not a strategy, it is herd thinking. It is the old argument about: &quot;No one was fired for choosing Microsoft&quot;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I did some major modifications to the project two days ago, moving properties around, adding / removing them. It was based on additional input about the model that we just got. It also meant that I had broke just about everything in the application, from the injection support to the CRUD functionality.    We have tests (not nearly enough, in my opinion, but we are working on it), but they are mostly building the UI right now, so there is a lot of focus there at the moment. We started testing with Selenium, and later moved to WatiN, this means that a lot of the stuff that I had to do with Selenium (manual waits, for instance) are not applicable. We are using a lot of ajax stuff, which meant that scattered throught the tests there were plenty of Sleep() calls, to wait for the action to complete. This caused the tests to be really slow when running the whole bunch.     I spent most of the day fixing the application and refactoring the tests. I got to go home with all the tests running green, but it had taken a long time to do it. Next week I could start new development knowing that I have a solid foundation, but I still left work feeling that I didn&#x27;t do anything meaningful to the project for the last couple of days.    I did a lot of work with the data, and we are now much closer to the real domain than we were before, but it is not something that I could feel. Just to get back own good side, I implemented this:            [InjectEntity(Key=&quot;PolicyId&quot;)]        public&#xA0;Policy&#xA0;&#xA0;Policy&#xA0;{&#xA0;get&#xA0;{&#xA0;...&#xA0;}&#xA0;set&#xA0;{&#xA0;...&#xA0;}&#xA0;}        So I would get at least some magic back.    I did learn a lof of good stuff, and our WatiN tests are now much better (and running faster). I should point out that testing Ajax actions is basically testing multi threaded code, and that is hard. I&#x27;ll post shortly about the current tests, I think that I got it to a good state, but damn, it was long.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">But feel free to start using it now. Adi&#x27;s post&#xA0;is bringing back memories from conversion long gone:First of all, even if a new technology from MS is not &quot;decent&quot; at first, you can be sure they&#x27;ll keep bringing out new versions till it is, because that&#x27;s what MS does best.    I had practically this statement thrown at me about 8-10 months ago, talking about why the customer wanted to use DLinq instead of NHibernate.    Adi, my response to that is, &quot;So?&quot;     I can get a bottle of wine that will taste real good in 15 years, that doesn&#x27;t mean that I need to start drinking it now.&#xA0;Sour grapes indeed.Take C# for example. It had no killer advantage over existing languages when it came out, yet even Oren uses it today. I doubt another company could have made that happen.    Just to point out, another company did, Sun &amp; Java. As for why I am using C#, have you looked at the alternatives? Before I did C# I was a C&#x2B;&#x2B; programmer. Can you imagine the stuff that I did with templates? I jumped into C# the moment I realize that I don&#x27;t have to manage my own memory anymore. Hell, C# has one feature that is a killer. Stacktraces for exceptions. C&#x2B;&#x2B; has 0x324ABCD memory could not be &quot;read&quot;.    I am not sure why, but I never got around to doing the other stuff (Java, Python, etc)...    Oh, and what is it with the babe?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Bill is asking how he can improve the work process of his team. The worst thing in his tale (aside from 1,500 lines of code in a set accessor!) is that there isn&#x27;t somebody that is in charge for the team, at least not someone who is technical. Unless&#xA0;a person&#xA0;is&#xA0;in a position of authority (preferably well established, rather than ad-hoc one), making significant changes is difficult.    I get a lot of milage from giving the client a link to the continious integration machine. They check to see what progress we made routinely, and the most common request I hear from them is to make the CI build more stable. (The answer to that is to give me a staging machine, but that is another story).    Doing something like this can prove to the stake holders that&#xA0;it is possibl deliver something that they desire, therefor, they will back the requirements when demands are made. In this situations, hiring the boss can be an interesting approach, go look for someone that you really admire, and then convince them to come work as the team leader /architect. Other ways include bringing in a coach, or sending the team to training.     All of the above assume that&#xA0;there is some sort of backup from above. If this is not possible, then support from the team members is crucial. From Bill&#x27;s post, it doesn&#x27;t sound like the other members of the teams are interested, but this may be because it wasn&#x27;t presented in the right manner. It is very easy to give advice about people I never knew, but broadly:            Show Mort how he can be more productive using smarter tools                 Pair with Jade to get stuff done.                 Challange the Primadona to a duel at sunrise.    More seriously, since Jade is apperantly the most experiance guy in Bill&#x27;s shop, a good way to start would be to sit with him and try to work incremental improvements. &quot;For the next month, we are putting in continious integration system, month after that, we start working on our design debt, etc&quot;.&#xA0;Define&#xA0;a certain level of quality that you will not go beneath. When two developers are collaborating, it should be easier to guide Mort into the fold. To begin with, the Primadona can be ignored, but once stuff started to roll, and the Primadona breaks it, take his code out out. I have reverted changes that broke unit tests in the past, much to the angst of a developer who didn&#x27;t consider what would happen when I come in to a broken build with no idea what had happened.     Failing all of that, starting to carry a 5Kg hammer and speaking softly always worked for me.    Bill also mentions:I don&#x27;t want to stand up and spend 30 minutes giving a presentation on IoC and separation of concerns.&#xA0;    Bill, if&#xA0;you are really serious about that, get another job. To start with, you will need to educate the rest of the team about what is happening. They need to be able to go to your code and understand what is going on. If you aren&#x27;t talking at the same level, this is a problem. And you are the guy to fix it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My post about entities and services seem to have hit a nerve, because it is probably my most popular post ever. I got some really good feedback on it. This post is mostly to ask questions, not neccesarily give answers. To make the discussion a bit more focused, here are the scenarios that I am talking about, in the context of a web-based application:            Display a list of customer&#x27;s orders.            Calculate total order cost            Display all the items in an order            Create new order            Add new item to order            Print full reciept for the order    Quite a few people didn&#x27;t like the fact that the service is tightly coupled to the implementation of Order.CalculateCost().&#xA0;Stephen suggested that I would use this type of code:money = orderService.GetOrder(orderId).CalculateCost()    If that is the case, there isn&#x27;t any difference between the service and a repository. The problem that I am trying to solve is actually performance, I want to load all the OrderLines assoicated with the order so I could make calculations over them. The code above would either cause lazy load, which is inefficent, or would always load everything, which is also inefficent.    Udi&#xA0;suggested building a set of interfaces for the actions that the class can take, and assoicate fetching strategies with each action, this way we decouple the service from the details of the CalculateCost() implementation. I like the idea, but I am not sure if this isn&#x27;t too much overhead for the scenario. Decoupling the fetching strategy is good, but I think that it is more appropriate for more complex problems.    Paul&#xA0;suggest going even further with the DDD route. I am pretty sure that I don&#x27;t understand what he means, so I would like it if someone could educate me. He had this code sample:            public&#xA0;T&#xA0;FindOne(IFetchSpecification&#xA0;fSpec)        {        &#xA0;fSpec.AddSpan(&quot;OrderLines&quot;);        &#xA0;return&#xA0;(T)context.Find(fSpec);        }        Which I don&#x27;t think is appropriate, once again, I don&#x27;t always want the order lines, I want them for specific scenarios only. And I am not sure how I can get the above code to behave in both scenarios.    (Currently) the last comment on the previous post belongs to Stephen, he suggests having an abstract type Order, and two decendants: DoesntHaveOrderLines&#xA0;and CalculatedOrder (which does have them). This solve the problem of knowing when to bring the data, but I really don&#x27;t think that splitting the entities according to performance concerns is a good way to go.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeremy Millier really hit the nail on the head with this one:I really think the .Net community needs to reexamine and debate the merits and appropriateness of the Visual RAD approach.&#xA0; A lot of what makes&#xA0;ASP.Net WebForms&#xA0;hard to test is the extra complexity that&#x27;s there to support design time controls, specifically the&#xA0;page&#xA0;event cycle.&#xA0; RAD is doing more damage than good because the negative impact on maintainability/testability overwhelms the &quot;write once&quot; advantages of RAD.</p>
