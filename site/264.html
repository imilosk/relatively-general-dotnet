These are the techniques I enjoy talking about, as well as applying them in my own projects. However, there was another field I always wanted to try myself in. That is game development. The ability to write my own games was the reason why I started learning to program in the first place. And I believe many programmers had this motivation behind their careers as well.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But let&#x2019;s start from the beginning.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Brotli is a compression algorithm. In general, it provides better compression results than gzip. For instance, the size of the default page of an ASP.NET Core project using gzip is 1797 bytes, and using Brotli, it&#x27;s only 1333 bytes. So it&#x27;s a 25% reduction!You can use Brotli with most of the major</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous part, I started looking at UpsertTransacction, but got sidetracked into the utils functions. Let us focus back on this. The key parts of UpsertRansaction are:Let us see what they are. The DocumentStream is the source of the documents that will be written in this transaction, its job is to get the documents to be indexed, to give them a unique id if they don&#x2019;t already have one and hash them.I&#x2019;m not sure yet what is the point there, but we have this:Which sounds bad. The likelihood is small, but it isn&#x2019;t a crypto hash, so likely very easily broken. For example, look at what happened to MurmurHash. I think that this is later used to handle some partitioning in the trie, but I&#x2019;m not sure yet. We&#x2019;ll look at the _storeWriter later. Let us see what the UpsertTransaction does. It builds a trie, then push each of the document from the stream to through the trie. The code is doing a lot of allocations, but I&#x2019;m going to stop harping at that from now on.The trie is called for each term for each document with the following information:The code isn&#x2019;t actually using tuple, I just collapsed a few classes to make it clear what the input is. This is what will eventually allow the trie to do lookups on a term and find the matching document, I&#x2019;m assuming.That method is going to start a new task for that particular field name, if it is new, and push the new list of words for that field into the work queue for that task. The bad thing here is that we are talking about a blocking task, so if you have a lot of fields, you are going to spawn off a lot of threads, one per field name.What I know now is that we are going to have a trie per field, and it is likely, based on the design decisions made so far, that a trie isn&#x2019;t a small thing. Next, the UpsertTransaction need to write the document, this is done taking the document we are processing and turning that into a dictionary of short to string. I&#x2019;m not sure how it is supposed to handle multiple values for the same field, but I&#x2019;ll ignore that for now. That dictionary is then saved into a file and its length and positions are returned.I know that I said that I won&#x2019;t talk about performance, but I looked at the serialization code and I saw that it is using compression, like this. This is done on a field by field basis, while you could probably benefit from compressing them all together.Those are a lot of allocations, and then we go a bit deeper:First, we have the allocation of the memory stream, then the ToArray call, and that happens, per field, per document. Actually, if we go up, we&#x2019;ll see: So it is allocations all the way down. Okay, let us focus on what is going on in terms of files:&quot;write.lock&quot; &#x2013; this one is pretty obvious*.da &#x2013; stands for document address. Holds a series of (long Position, int Size) of document addresses. I assume that this is using the same sort as something else, not sure yet. The fact that this is fixed size means that we can easily skip into it.*.rdoc &#x2013; documents are stored here. Contains the actual serialized data for the documents (the Dictionary&lt;short, Field&gt;), this is the target for the addresses that are held by the &#x201C;*.da&#x201D; files.*.pk &#x2013; holds document hashes. Holds a list of document pk hash and a flag saying if it is deleted, I&#x2019;m assuming. From context, it looks like the hash is a way to update documents across transactions. *.kix &#x2013; key index. Text file holding the names of all the fields across the entire transaction. *.pos &#x2013; posting file. This one holds the tries that were built during the transaction. This is basically just List&lt;(int DocumentId, int Count)&gt;, but I&#x2019;m not sure how they are used just yet. It looks like this is how Resin is able to get the total term frequency per document. It looks like this is also sorted.*.tri &#x2013; the trie files that actually contain the specific values for a particular field. The name pattern is &#x201C;{indexVersion}-{fieldName}.tri&#x201D;. That means that your field names are limited to valid file names, by the way.The last part of the UpsertTransaction is the commit, which essentially boil down to this:I think that this was very insightful read, I have a much better understanding of how Resin actually work. I&#x2019;m going to speculate wildly, and then use my next post to check further into that.Let us say that we want to search for all users who live in New York City. We can do that by opening the &#x201C;636348272149533175-City.tri&#x201D; file. The 636348272149533175 is the index version, by the way.Using the trie, we search for the value of New York City. The trie value actually give us a (long Position, int Size) into the 636348272149533175.pos file, which holds the posting. Basically, we now have an array of (int DocumentId, int Count) of the documents that matched that particular value. If we want to retrieve those documents, we can use the 636348272149533175.da file, which holds the addresses of the documents. Again, this is effectively an array of (long Position, int Size) that we can index into using the DocumentId. This points to the location on the 636348272149533175.rdoc file, which holds the actual document data. I&#x2019;m not sure yet what the point of *.pa and *.kix is, but I&#x2019;m sure the next post we&#x2019;ll figure it out.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We take security very seriously. With the move to X509 certificates only for authentication (on all RavenDB editions) I feel that we have a really good story around securing RavenDB and controlling access to it. Almost. One of the more annoying things about security is that you also need to consider the hard cases, such as the administrators messing up badly. As in, losing the credentials that allows you to administrator RavenDB. This can happen because the database has just run without issue for so long that no one can remember where the keys are. That isn&#x2019;t supposed to happen, but RavenDB has been in production usage for close to a decade now, which mean that we have seen our fair share of mess ups (both our own and by customers).In some cases, we have had to help a customer manage a third system handover between different hosting providers, which felt very much half like forensic and half like hacking. In short, when we design a system now, we also consider the fact that as secure as we want the system to be, there must be a way for an authorized person to get in.If this made you cringe, you are in good company. I both love and hate this feature. I love it because it is going to be very useful, I hate it because it was a headache to figure it right. But I&#x2019;m jumping ahead of myself. What is this backdoor that I&#x2019;m talking about?Properly configured RavenDB will require a client certificate (that was registered in the cluster) to access the server. However, in addition to listening over HTTPS, RavenDB will also listen for commands on standard input. An admin can use the standard input / output as a way to talk with RavenDB without requiring any authentication. Basically, we expose a mini shell that you can use to enter commands and inspect and change our state.Here is how it looks like when running in console mode:From a security point of view, if a user is able to access my standard input, that usually means that they are the one that have run this process or are able to so. RavenDB obviously won&#x2019;t have any setuid bits turned on, so no need to worry about a user tricking us to do something that the user don&#x2019;t have permissions to do.So using the console is a really nice way for us to offer the administrator an escape hatch to start messing with the internals of RavenDB in interesting way. However, that only work if you are running RavenDB in interactive mode. What about when running as a service or daemon? They don&#x2019;t have a standard input that is available to the admin. In fact, in most production deployments, you won&#x2019;t have an easy time at all trying to connect to the console. So that option is out, sadly. Or is it?The nice thing about operating systems is that we can lean on them. In this case, we expose the exact same console that we have for stdin / stdout using Named Pipes (actually, Unix Sockets in Linux / Mac, but pretty much the same idea). The idea is that those are both methods for inter process communication that are local to the machine and can be secured by the operating system directly. In this case, we make sure that the pipe is only accessible to the RavenDB user (and to root / Administrator, obviously). That means that an admin can log into the box, run a single command and land in the RavenDB admin shell where he can manage the server. For example, by registering a new certificate in the server .Because only the user running the RavenDB process or an administrator / root can access the pipe (ensured by setting the proper ACL on the pipe during creation) we know that there isn&#x2019;t any security risk here. An admin can already override any security in the box, and the permissions are always on the user level, not the process level, so if you are running as the same user as the RavenDB process you can already do anything that RavenDB can do. After we ensured that our security isn&#x2019;t harmed by this option, we can relax knowing that we have an easy (and safe) way for the administrator to manage the server in an emergency. In fact, the most obvious usage of this feature is during initial cluster setup, when you don&#x2019;t have anything yet. This allow you to enter the system as a trusted party and do the initial configuration.</p>
