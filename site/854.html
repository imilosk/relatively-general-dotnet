        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just read a comment&#xA0;that really annoyed me, talking about the lack of need for caching.These days DBMS are not just a &#x201C;persistent storage&#x201D;; a DBMS is designed to handle many concurrent hits and transaction processes using multi CPU support and terabytes of memory pages. I don&#x2019;t understand why we developers are so obsessed with the number of hits.    Just to note, I have caused a 32Gb, 64bits, 4 CPU Server to weap tears of shame when I run 900 concurrent queries traversing just under Billion rows. It worked, but it wasn&#x27;t pretty. That, however, is not a core scenario in most cases.    What is a core scenario is the time that responsiveness of the application, how long it takes to serve a single request. Here, it doesn&#x27;t matter how smart the database is. The deciding factor is the amount of queries performed, each of them, to remind you, is a remote call, which is easily a hundred times more expensive than anything that you might do locally.    The problem with the comment above is that it is also ignoring several other factors, including the query complexity, the number of concurrent connections, how much IO and computing each query takes, etc. I think that it is safe to say that it is at least an order of magnitude harder to scale the database (up and wide) than to scale the application, so anything that reduce the amount of work the database need to do is a Good Thing.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently talked quite a bit about caches in NHibernate, and I am a great believer in careful use of it in order to give an application much better performance. Frans Buoma, however, does not agree. Just to note, Frans is the author of LLBLGen Pro.    First, let me point to an issue that I have with the terminology that he uses. When Frans is talking about cache and uniquing, he refers to a term generally (at least by N/Hibernate &amp; Fowler) called Identity Map.    Frans:&#xA0;A cache is an object store which manages objects so you don&#x27;t have to re-instantiate objects over and over again, you can just re-use the instance you need from the cache.    Fowler:Ensures that each object gets loaded only once by keeping every loaded object in a map.    When speaking about the advantages of an Identity Map, performance is almost never the first reason to use it. It is a side benefit, which can have a certain affect, but it is not the main reason for that. If we consider&#xA0;Frans&#x27; arguments as they apply to Identity Map, I agree. If nothing else, Identity Map tends to be fairly short lived and limited in scope in most cases, so it doesn&#x27;t have the chance to be of great effectiveness.    But an OR/M has an opportunity to cache much more than just at the session / context level. A word of warning, though, as was mentioned in the post, Caching by its very nature means that you are not seeing the very latest data. You can use cache invalidation policies (including the new data driven cache invalidation policites in .Net 2.0) to help, but you should be aware of this issue.    However, when we consider the common scenarios, it is not often that we need to have real time information. The case than Frans is presenting is a CRM application with a query on all the customers that has more than 5 orders in the last month.    Do we really need this data at real time? Or can we be satisfied with data from several minutes ago? This question is dependant on the business scenario, but fairly often the answer is that we can be reasonably satisfied with a data that is a few minutes or hours behind the real events.Even if we would like to get real time data, the data can be changed between the time that we queried it and the time that we displayed it, so we would need to query again as soon as we finished displaying (or maybe at the same time as), ad infinitum.     Given that we assume that the business requirements allows us to use caching, this has tremendous benefit perfromance wise. Let us assume that we have cached the query and its results (again, I&#x27;m using NHibernate as the model here, and its caches are not caching live entities, but rather their values), we can then satisfy the query entirely from the cache (which usually mean in-proc memory).    The only real cost of the query is several hash table lookups, which are (by their nature) very fast, and constructing the objects, which I already shown to be highly efficent. The end result is that we can serve the results immediately. In many cases, even a cache that is valid for a few minutes can significantly reduce the amounts of queries that the DB has to process.    The concerns that Frans is raising are valid in the context* that he is talking about, but I disagree that caches are not extremely improtant to performance. That said, they should not be over used, and the DB is still the one and only authoritive source for the data. I have seen some places where the requirement is to run the application entirely from cache, without touching the database at all.    This is taking this way too far...    * Do you get the joke here?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">His Majesty&#x27;s Dragon (Temeraire, Book 1)                                                                                              Throne of Jade (Temeraire, Book 2)                                                                                              Black Powder War (Temeraire, Book 3)                                             As a testement to the quality of these book, I would like to mentioned that I read all three between firday 18:00 and sunday 05:30. I truely enjoy fantasy / science fiction / alternative history books, and this trilogy hits all the right spots.    The story takes place in the beginning of the 19th century, and tells of a world different than ours only by the existance of dragons. No magic, no mambo jumbo, just dragons. Of course, you can&#x27;t say &quot;just&quot; dragons, and Naomi Novik&#xA0;does an excellent job in creating more than a story, but creating a full, living, breathing world.    I read quite a bit about that time in history (the Napolean Wars are the background for the books, by the way), and the way they are portraited in the books are very close to what really happened, and likely to stick with me more than the real history.    The dragons are fitted into the story with marvelous care, seamlessly woven into the fabric of the world. I liked the first book the most, since it had the&#xA0; most action, but the other two are very good as well.    The only half way annoying thing about the books is that the third one ends with a lot more stuff that I want to know about this world. How would the war end? Will the heroes be able to escape the clutches of the beauricrats, etc...    I surely hope that there is going to be more books in this world.    Highly recommended.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The recent posts by Joel caused quite a bit of noise lately, but are several things in Joel&#x27;s Wasabi&#xA0;post caught my eye that I haven&#x27;t seen blogged elsewhere:Another neat thing is that when you want to do something on the client (the web browser) you can write the code once, in Wasabi, and compile it to JavaScript for the browser and get identically functioning VBScript or PHP code for the server    Can anyone say leaky abstractions? VBScript &amp; JScript are very similar, I will grant him that, but client side vs. server side programming is very different. And unless all they are doing is basically string concantaion, I really don&#x27;t think that it is possible to have the same code in both places.    It is certainly possible to use the same langauge in both cases, but not code of any complexity is going to be portable between the two environment.It&#x27;s very easy to add a new back-end to Wasabi. Our plan is that when .NET gets a little bit more predominant on our clients&#x27; Windows servers, we&#x27;ll add a CLR back-end.    Again, leaky abstractions. FogBugz was originally an ASP (classic) application, which means connected data model, recordset, etc. I would hazzard a guess that it is still uses much of this model. .Net has a completely different data model than ASP. This is not going to be a new backend only port, not if they intend to do more than put a checkbox saying &quot;Run on CLR&quot;.Most people don&#x27;t realize that writing a compiler like this is only about 2 months work for one talented person    Um, writing a compiler isn&#x27;t that much of a challange, yes. The problem is with all the other stuff that a language need. For instance, a debugger. Oh, you are not going to write your own debugger, but rely on the native VBScript / JScript debugers.&#xA0;On the top of my list of &quot;things not to do in christmas&quot; is &quot;debugging generated code&quot;*.    * Actually, I don&#x27;t do anything in christmas, so it it a mote list.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">David Hayden has a post&#xA0;about moving away from the Active Record pattern. In it, he suggests to create two&#xA0;classes per domain model object. For instnace, a Customer class and a CustomerDAO (data access object) class. I tend to call this object a Repository, instead of DAO, but this is mainly a matter of taste, I think.    What is more interesting is the different reasons for choosing one approach or the other.    I tend to use Active Record (both library and pattern :-) ) when I don&#x27;t need to take complex actions along the persistance path. And use explicit Repository when I need to take actions along the persistance path (for example, filterring objects by security, turning deletes to logical deletes, turning updates to inserts, etc...).</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">System.DateTime is a value type, and as such, cannot be null. The default value for DateTime in .Net is DateTime.MinValue, which equals to 01/01/001 00:00. The problem is that SQL Server&#x27;s dates start at 1753, or there about.    This is usualy solved in .Net 2.0 using Nullable&lt;DateTime&gt; (or DateTime? in C#), but my &quot;entities&quot; are messages to web services, and are generated from WSDL, so they lacked this nice feature. I also didn&#x27;t realize that some of the DateTime values were nullable until pretty late into the game.    After a lot of head scratching, I came up with this solution, which utilizes NHibernate&#x27;s IInterceptor capabilities. The interceptor allows to get the raw data before it is loaded and after it is saved, and interfer with it. Using that, I got this DefaultDateToNullInterceptor:            public bool OnFlushDirty(                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; object entity, object id, object[] currentState, object[] previousState, string[] propertyNames,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; IType[] types)                        {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; MinValueToNull(currentState, types);                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; return true;                        }                                            &#xA0;                                public bool OnSave(object entity, object id, object[] state, string[] propertyNames, IType[] types)                        {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; MinValueToNull(state, types);                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; return true;                        }        The OnSave() and OnFlushDirty()&#xA0;methods are called before the values are saved or updated (respectively). The MinValueToNull() method is very simple, it replace all instances of DateTime.MinValue with null, like this:            private static void MinValueToNull(object[] state, IType[] types)                        {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; int index = 0;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; foreach (IType type in types)                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; if(type.ReturnedClass == typeof(DateTime) &amp;&amp;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; DateTime.MinValue .Equals(state[index] ))                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; state[index] = null;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; }                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; index&#x2B;=1 ;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; }                        }                        All that was left was openning the session with the interceptor, and I was set.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The worst part of building a distributed application is that you get different state in different parts of the system. Let us take a look at a simple message passing application, and the issues there. At the end of the day, each and every message should arrive once, and exactly once. I am assuming that it is not possible for the message to be corrupted in transmissions (The TCP/IP stack in general makes sure that you won&#x27;t see those messages).    The simplest model is where everything works out great:        A common scenario is that the sender failed to send the message:        A simple resolution is sending the message again, and again, until you get an OK reply back. But then there is the dropped reply scenario, the reciever got the message, but the reply was dropped. As far as the sender knows, the reciever never got the message:        A naive implementation on the reciever side will lead to the duplicate message scenario, but a slightly less naive implementation, which detects and errors on duplicate messages may result in&#xA0;a lot more headaches in the end, consider this scenario:        The sender never recieves an OK reply for his message, so it will send it to the end of the days. The reciever got the message the first time and replied just fine, but the sender persist trying to give it duplicate data, which means that it keeps returning error messages back.    A good way to prevent that is to check before sending, like this:        Assuming that we always keep this semantics, a failure at any points of the road never leads to losing messages or duplicating them. I tried, but I can&#x27;t think of a way the sender will think that the reciever got a message when the reciever didn&#x27;t get it.    Just to point out, the scenario above happens all the way up from TCP. This is a relatively simple scenario. More interesting ones include ordered messages, and two ways communications.    Hope you liked the pretty pictures.</p>
