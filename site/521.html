The following is the low level API that you would use with LumenQ, a Silverlight queuing framework.     var postOFfice = new PostOFfice(&quot;http://my-server/lunemq/messages&quot;)&#xA;    .RegisterForTopic(&quot;/customers/939192&quot;)&#xA;    .RegisterForTopic(&quot;/notifications&quot;)&#xA;    .OnMessageArrived(HandleMessageFromServer)&#xA;    .Start();&#xA;&#xA;postOFfice.Send(new MyRecommendations&#xA;{&#xA;    UserId = 9393&#xA;});&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Note that OnMessageArrived is a low level API, there is also an API similar to the Rhino Service Bus, which allows you to inherit from ConsumerOf&lt;T&gt; and gain strongly typed access to what is going on there.&#xA;&#xA;Messages to this client will include:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  Any message on the /customers/939192 and /notifications topics&#xA;&#xA;  Any message posted specifically to this client&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I am still struggling to decide what sort of infrastructure support I want to give the library, things like error handling are drastically different than in the Rhino Service Bus world, for example.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post, I discussed the following scenario, a smart client application for managing Machines, Parts &amp; Maintenance History:     From the client perspective, Machine,Parts &amp; Maintenance History where all part of the same entity, and they wanted to be able to be able return that to the user in a single call. They run into several problems in doing that, mostly, from what I could see, because they tried to do something that I strongly discourage, sending entities on the wire so they could be displayed on the smart client application. The client uses CSLA, so the actual business logic is sitting in Factory objects (I discussed my objection to that practice here), but the entities are still doing triple duty here. They need to be saved to the database, serve as DTOs on the wire and also handle being presented in the UI.   When I objected to that practice, I was asked: &#x201C;Are we supposed to have three duplicates of everything in the application? One for the database, one for the wire and one for the UI? That is insane!&#x201D;  The answer to this question is:    This is the symbol for Mu, which is the answer you give when the question is meaningless.   The problem with the question as posed is that it contains an invalid assumption. The assumption is that the three separate models in the application are identical to one another. They aren&#x2019;t, not by a long shot.  Let me see if I can explain it better with an example. Given the Machine &#x2013;&gt;&gt; Part &#x2013;&gt;&gt; Maintenance History model, and an application to manage those as our backdrop. We will take two sample scenarios to discuss, the first would be to record replacing a part in a machine, and the second would be looking at a list of machines that need fixing.  For the first scenario, we need to show the user the Maintenance screen for the machine, which looks like this:     And on the second one, machines requiring fixes, we have:     Now, both of those screens are driven by data in the Machine &#x2013;&gt;&gt; Part &#x2013;&gt;&gt; Maintenance History model. But they have very different data requirements.  In the first case, we need the Machine.Name, Machine.NextMaintenanceDate, and a list of Part.SKU, Part.Name, Part.Broken, Part.Notes.  In the second case, we need Machine.Owner, Machine.Car, Machine.Age, Machine.Preferred.  The data set that they require is completely different, not only that, but sending the full object graph to each of those is a waste. If you noticed, no one actually even needed Maintenance History for any of those screens. It is likely that Maintenance History will be only needed rarely, but by saying that there is only one model that needs to serve all those different scenarios, we are tying ourselves into knots, because we need to serve Maintenance History every time that we are asked for a machine, even though it is not needed.  The way I would design the system, I would have:  Entities: Machine, Part, Maintenance History  This is the full data model that we use. Note that I am not discussing issues like CQRS here, because the application doesn&#x2019;t warrant it. A single model for everything would work well here.  DTO: MachineHeaderDTO, MachineAndPartsDTO, PartAndMaintenanceHistoryDTO, etc.  We have specific DTOs for each scenario, only giving us the data that we need, so we can spare a lot of effort in the server side in deciding how to fill the data.  View Models  The view models would be built on top of the DTOs, usually providing some additional services like INotifyPropertyChanged, calculated properties, client side validation, etc.  I am in favor of each screen having its own View Models, because that lead to a self contained application, but I wouldn&#x2019;t have a problem with common view models shared among the entire application.  Sample application  And because I know you&#x2019;ll want to see some code, the Alexandria sample application demonstrate those concepts quite well: http://github.com/ayende/alexandria</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Microsoft LightSwitch is a new 4GL tool from Microsoft, this is another in the series of &#x201C;you don&#x2019;t have to write any code&#x201D; tools that I have seen.  Those are the tools that will give the secretary the ability to create applications and eliminate the need for coders. The industry has been chasing those tools since the 80s (does anyone remember the promises of the CASE tools?). We have seen many attempts at doing this, and all of them have run into a wall pretty quickly.   Oh, you can build a tool that gives you UI on top of a data store pretty easily. And you can go pretty far with it, but eventually your ability to point &amp; click hit the limit, and you have to write code. And that is things totally breaks down.  LightSwitch is not yet publically available, so I have to rely on the presentation that Microsoft published. And I can tell you that I am filled with dread, based on what I have seen.  First of all, I strongly object to the following slide. Because I have the experience to know that working with a tool like that is akin to do back flips with a straightjacket on.     The capabilities of the tools that were shown in the presentation have strongly underwhelmed me in terms of newness, complexity or applicability.   Yeah, a meta data driven UI. Yeah, it can do validation on a phone number automatically (really, what happen with my Israeli based phone number?), etc. What is worse, even through the demo, I get the very strong feeling that the whole things is incredibly slow, you can see in the presentation multi second delays between screen repaints.   Then there are things like &#x201C;it just works as a web app or windows app&#x201D; which is another pipe dream that the industry has been chasing for a while. And the only piece of code that I have seen is this guy:  &#xA0;   Which makes me want to break down and cry.  Do you know why? Because this is going to be the essence of a SELECT N&#x2B;1 in any system, because this code is going to run once per each row in the grid. And when I can find bugs from watching a presentation, you know that there are going to be more issues.  So, just for fun sake, since I don&#x2019;t have the bits and I can rely only on the presentation, I decided to make a list of all the things that are likely to be wrong with LightSwitch.  I&#x2019;ll review it when it comes out, and if it does manage to do everything that it does and still be a tool usable by developers, I&#x2019;ll have to eat crow (well, Raven :-) ), but I am not overly worried.  Here are a few areas where I am feeling certain things will not work right:     Source control &#x2013; how do I diff two versions of the app to see what changes? Are all changes diffable?     Programmatic modifications:         what happen when I want to write some code to do custom validation of property (for instance, calling a web service)?      what happen when I want to put a custom control on the screen (for instance, a google maps widget)?       Upsizing &#x2013; when it gets to a 1,000 users and we need a full blown app, how hard it is to do?    Performance &#x2013; as I said, I think it is slow from the demo.    Data access behavior &#x2013; from what I have seen so far, I am willing to be that it hits its data store pretty heavily.   I fully recognize that there is a need for such a tool, make no mistake. And giving users the ability to do that is important. What I strongly object to is the notion that it would be useful for developers writing real apps, not forms over data. To put it simply, simple forms over data is a solved problem. There is a large number of tools out there to do that. From Access to Oracle Apex to FoxPro. Hell, most CRM solutions will give you just that.  My concern is that there seems to be an emphasis on that being useful for developers as well, and I strongly doubt that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">At a client site, I found the following in all the mapping files:     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;&#xA;&lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns=&quot;urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2&quot; default-lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;class name=&quot;Machine&quot; table=&quot;Machines&quot; lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/id&gt;&#xA;        &lt;property name=&quot;Name&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;set name=&quot;Parts&quot; table=&quot;Parts&quot; lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;key column=&quot;BlogId&quot;/&gt;&#xA;            &lt;one-to-many class=&quot;Part&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/set&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/class&gt;&#xA;&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I think that you can figure out by now what is wrong. It is too bad that the &lt;blink/&gt; tag has gone out of use, because that would be an accurate reflection of how I responded when I saw that. After I finished frothing at the mouth, I explained that you never ever do things like, because it leads to pain, mayhem and tears. &#xA;&#xA;The lead dev heard me out, then explained that their situation wasn&#x2019;t a standard web application, their server had some business functionality, but it served mainly as a way for clients to come in and get some data. The architecture looks like this:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;As you can imagine, NHibernate is sitting in the Application tier, but a lot of the work is done on the smart client application.&#xA;&#xA;The lead dev explained that in their scenario, they needed to send the full entity to the smart client app, so they didn&#x2019;t want lazy loading. Their scenario also precluded the need to do lazy loading over the network, so all was good, and they made the decision to use lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D; intentionally. Their model was pretty good about not having deeply connected object graphs, too.&#xA;&#xA;I hit Google and searched for the relevant posts:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  ayende strippers &#x2013; Which leads to the post: The Stripper Pattern. &#xA;&#xA;  castrate ayende * &#x2013; Which leads to the post: Don&#x2019;t castrate your architecture &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;* Googling that made me very nervous.&#xA;&#xA;I include the search terms as a reminder to myself that post titles are important, because that is how I search for them after the fact. And I got some really strong (and strange) looks when I did that.&#xA;&#xA;After we discussed that we put it aside and moved to other topics. Until we came to the part where we profiled the system.&#xA;&#xA;We immediately found some trouble spots that we needed to resolve. One of them was getting a list of machines that required fixing.&#xA;&#xA;The problem was that the code looked something like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  public IEnumerable&lt;Machine&gt; GetMachinesRequiringFixes()&#xA;{&#xA;    return (from machine in session.Linq&lt;Machine&gt;()&#xA;           where machine.Status == Statuses.Broken&#xA;           select machine).Take(10);&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Looks easy, right?&#xA;&#xA;Except that this seemingly innocent piece of code was responsible for 400 queries.&#xA;&#xA;What went wrong? How could loading 10 machines result in that many queries?&#xA;&#xA;Well, let us look what NHibernate did, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;select top 10 * from Machines where Status = &#x27;Broken&#x27;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This gives NHibernate ten machines instances, except that when NHibernate investigate the mapping for a Machine, it realizes that it needs to load the Parts collection, since it was marked lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, so NHibernate will execute ten queries for loading each Machine&#x2019;s Parts.&#xA;&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 40&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 41&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 42&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 43&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 44&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 45&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 46&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 47&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 48&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 49&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But each Part also has an association for a MaintenanceHistory, which was also marked lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, so NHibernate had to load those as well. (I&#x2019;ll spare you that one :-) ).&#xA;&#xA;From the client perspective, Machine,Parts &amp; Maintenance History where all part of the same entity, and they wanted to be able to be able return that to the user in a single call. (More on that fallacy in my next post).&#xA;&#xA;The problem is that when you set lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, you literally ties NHibernate&#x2019;s hands. Now, you could start playing with the fetch mode option, to change that to join or subselect, but the problem is that this works when you have only one collection association (in the entire graph), because otherwise you run into sever Cartesian products issues.&#xA;&#xA;Now, NHibernate has the ability to handle just that scenario, but by setting lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, you prevent NHibernate from having the chance to actually utilize them.&#xA;&#xA;There is a good reason why lazy is set to true by default, and while I am sure that there is some limited number of scenarios where lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D; is the appropriate choice, it isn&#x2019;t for your scenario.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just read a very insightful post from Evan Nagle about the topic. In it, Evan hit a key point:     Technically (and commercially) speaking, Microsoft has a slew of perfectly legitimate reasons for splattering the landscape with these &quot;watered down&quot; technologies. But, culturally speaking, it&#x27;s painful to the professional Microsoft developer. It is. Because the Microsoft developer&#x27;s personal and professional identity is tied up in the Microsoft stack, and that stack is now catering to a bunch of cat ladies and acne-laden teenagers. That&#x27;s the real issue here.   If Microsoft thinks that they can get the market for bad developers, good for them. But that needs to be highly segmented. It should be clear that going with that route is leading you to a walled garden and that writing real apps this way is not good. The best comparison I can think of is Access apps in the 90s. There was a clear separation between &#x201C;just wanna write some forms over data app over the weekend&#x201D; and &#x201C;I want to build a real application&#x201D;. When you built an app in Access, you had very clear idea about the limitations of the application, and you knew that if you wanted something more, it would be a complete re-write.  That was a good thing, because it meant that you could do the quick &amp; dirty things, but when things got messy, you knew that you had to make the jump.  The problem with things like Microsoft.Data is that there is no such line in the sand. And when you call it &#x201C;Microsoft.*&#x201D; you give it a seal of approval for everything. And when you have a piece of code that is explicitly designed to support bad coding practices, it is like peeing in the pool. If there is only one pool, it is going to affect everyone. There wouldn&#x2019;t be nearly as much objection if it was called WebMatrix.Data, because that would clearly put it in someone else&#x2019;s pool, and it that turn into a putrid swamp, I don&#x2019;t really care.   There is another issue here, and it is not just that the community is afraid of inheriting horrible Microsoft.Data projects. It is much more than that.   Salary data is from the UK, because that is the first site I found with the numbers)     C# average salary: &#xA3;42,000    VB.NET average salary: &#xA3;34,000   Now, I really can&#x2019;t think of a good technical reason why VB.Net programmers are paid so much less, but those data points match what I have seen about salaries for developers in both positions.  In other words, VB.Net developers are getting paid a lot less for doing the same job.  Now, why is that? Is it because of the legacy of VisualBasic still haunts the VB guys? Because there is still the impression that VB is a toy language? I don&#x2019;t know, but I think that at least in part, that is true. And that is what happen when a platform gets a reputation for being messy. People know in their bones that building stuff there is going to be costly, because maintaining this stuff is so hard.   Microsoft has repeatedly stated that they are after the people who currently go to PHP. Let me do the same comparison:     PHP average salary: &#xA3;32,500    Ruby average salary: &#xA3;45,000    Python average salary: &#xA3;47,500   I don&#x2019;t like those numbers. I really don&#x2019;t like them.   Put simply, if Microsoft attempts to make the .NET platform more approachable for the PHP guys, it is also going to devalue the entire platform. I am pretty sure that this is something that they don&#x2019;t want. Having a lot of hobbist programmer but fewer professional ones is going to hurt the Microsoft eco system.  Microsoft, if you want to create a PHP haven in the .NET world, that is great, but make sure that it is completely isolated, because otherwise you are going to hurt everyone who has a commercial stake in your platform.  I think that there is a lot of sense from commercial point of view in WebMatrix, but it should be clear that this isn&#x2019;t .NET programming, this is WebMatrix programming. So if Microsoft succeed in gaining market share for this, it won&#x2019;t be the .NET developers who would suddenly look at a 30% less money, it would be WebMatrix developers who would have to carry that stigma.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just saw this post, and I had to double check the date of the post twice to be sure that I am reading about something that is going to come out soon, rather than something that have come out in 2002.  This is the code that is being proudly presented as an achievement:     using (var db = Database.Open(&quot;Northwind&quot;)) {&#xA;    foreach (var product in db.Query(&quot;select * from products where UnitsInStock &lt; 20&quot;)) {&#xA;        Response.Write(product.ProductName &#x2B; &quot; &quot; &#x2B; product.UnitsInStock);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Allow me to give you the exact statements used:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  The user doesn&#x2019;t have to learn about connection strings or how to create a command with a connection and then use a reader to get the results. Also, the above code is tied to Sql Server since we&#x2019;re using specific implementations of the connection, command, and reader(SqlConnection, SqlCommand, SqlDataReader).&#xA;&#xA;  Compare this with code below it. We&#x2019;ve reduced the amount of lines required to connect to the database, and the syntax for accessing columns is also a lot nicer, that&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re taking advantage of C#&#x2019;s new dynamic feature.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I really don&#x2019;t know where to start. Yes, compared to raw ADO.Net I guess that this is improvement. But being beaten only thrice a week instead of daily is also an improvement. &#xA;&#xA;I mean, seriously, are you freaking kidding me? Are you telling me that you are aiming to make the life of people writing code like this easier? &#xA;&#xA;We have direct use of Response.Write &#x2013; because it is so hard to create maintainable code, we decided to just give up from the get go. Beyond that, putting SQL directly in the code like that, including the parameters, is an open invitation for SQL injection.&#xA;&#xA;Next, let us talk seriously, okay. Anyone who had to write ADO.Net code already wrapped it up. Anyone who didn&#x2019;t isn&#x2019;t going to.&#xA;&#xA;But given all the times that we have heard &#x201C;no resources to fix XYZ&#x201D; from Microsoft, are you telling me that creating a framework that is intended for really bad programmers to slide down the maintainability scale more easily? Is that a valuable use of resources?&#xA;&#xA;Writing code like that is actively harmful, period. There is really no need to deal with those low level stuff in this day and age.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This came in as a comment for my post about encapsulating DALs:     Just for the sake of DAL - what if I want to persist my data in another place, different than a relational database? For instance, in a object-oriented database, or just serialize the entities and store them somewhere on the disk... What about then ? NHibernate cannot handle this situation, can it ? Wouldn&#x27;t I be entitled to abstract my DAL so that it can support such case ?   The problem here is that it assume that such a translation is even possible.   Let us take the typical Posts &amp; Comments scenario. In a relational model, I would model this using two tables. Now, let us say that I have the following DAL operations:     GetPost(id)     GetPostWithComments(id)     GetRecentPostsWithCommentCount(id)    The implementation of this should be pretty obvious on a relational system.   But when you move to a document database, for example, suddenly this &#x201C;abstract&#x201D; API becomes an issue.  How do you store comments? As separate documents, embedded in the post? If they are embedded in the post, GetPost will now have the comments, which isn&#x2019;t what happens with the relational implementation. If they are separate documents, you complicated the implementation of GetPostWithComments, and GetRecentPostsWithCommentCount now have a SELECT N&#x2B;1 problem.  Now, to be absolutely clear, you can certainly do that, there are fairly simple solutions for that, but this isn&#x2019;t how you would build the system if you started from a document database standpoint.  What you would end up with in a document database design is probably just:     GetPost(id)     GetRecentPosts(id)    Things like methods for eagerly loading stuff just don&#x2019;t happen there, because if you need to eagerly load stuff, they are embedded in the document.  Again, you can make this work, but you end up with a highly procedural API that is very unpleasant to work with. Consider the Membership Provider API as a good example of that. The API is a PITA to work with compared to APIs that don&#x2019;t need to work to the lowest common denominator.  When talking about data stores, that usually means limit yourself to key/value store operations, and even then, there is stuff that leaks through. Let me show you an example that you might be familiar with:     The MembershipProvider is actually a good example of an API that try to fit several different storage systems. It has a huge advantage from the get go because it comes with two implementations for two different storage systems (RDBMS and ActiveDirectory).   Note the API that you have, not only is it highly procedural, but it can also assume nothing about its implementation. It makes for code that is highly coupled to this API and to this form of working with data in procedural fashion. This make it much harder to work with compared to code using a system that enable automatic change tracking and data store synchronization (pretty much every ORM).  That is one problem of such APIs, it greatly increase the cost of working with it. Another problem is that stuff still leaks through.  Take a look at the GetNumberOfUsersOnline method. That is a method that can only be answered efficiently on a relational database. The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider just didn&#x2019;t implement this method, because it isn&#x2019;t possible to answer that question from ActiveDirectory.  By that same token, you can&#x2019;t implement FindUsersByEmail, FindUsersByName on a key/value store (well, you can maintain a reverse index, of course), nor can you implement GetAllUsers.  You can&#x2019;t abstract the nature of the underlying data store that you use, it is going to leak through. The issues isn&#x2019;t so much if you can make it work, you usually can, the issue is if you can make it work efficiently. Typical problems that show up is that you try to map concepts that simply do not exists in the underlying data store.  Relations is a good example of something that it is very easy to do in SQL but very hard to do using almost anything else. You can still do that, of course, but now your code is full of SELECT N&#x2B;1 and you can waive goodbye to your performance. If you build an API for a document database and try to move it to a relational one, you are going to get hit with &#x201C;OMG! It takes 50 queries to save this entity on a database, and 1 request to save it on a DocDb&#x201D;, leaving aside the problem that you are also going to have problems reading it from a relational database (the API would assume that you give back the full object).  In short, abstractions only work as long as you can assume that what you are abstracting is roughly similar. Abstracting the type of the relational database you use is easy, because you are abstracting the same concept. But you can&#x27;t abstract away different concepts. Don&#x2019;t even try.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Package management for .NET has long been an issue. I won&#x2019;t rehash the story, but you can read about a lot of the problems here.  There has been several attempts to replicate the success of Gems in Ruby, but none has really taken hold. Dru Sellers &amp; Rob Reynolds had decided to take a slightly different approach. Instead of trying to replicate Ruby&#x2019;s gems, just use them.  That is how Nu was created (and I really want to know what that name was picked, I nearly titled this post Dr. No). Before you can use Nu, you need to install it, which means that you have to make the following one time steps:     Install Ruby (you can also use Iron Ruby, but the Ruby installer is just sweet &amp; painless).    gem install nu   Once this is done, all you need to do to install a piece of software is just write:     nu install rhino.mocks    nu install nhibernate   And Nu will get the latest version (including resolving dependencies) and put them in your lib folder.  After executing the two commands above, I have the following contents in my lib directory.     castle.core    castle.dynamicproxy2    log4net    nhibernate    rhino.mocks   I like it, it is going to make things so much simpler!</p>
