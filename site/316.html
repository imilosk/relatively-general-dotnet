            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For the past two years or so, we have been working very hard on RavenDB 4.0. You have seen some of the posts in this blog detailing some of the work we have been doing. In RavenDB 4.0 we have put a tremendous amount of emphasis on performance and reducing the amount of work we are doing. We have been quite successful. Our metrics show a minimum of 10x improvement across the board, and often we are even faster. I&#x2019;m going to be posting a lot about RavenDB 4.0 in the next few weeks, to highlight some of the new stuff, this time in context, but for now, let me just say that I haven&#x2019;t been this excited about releasing software since the 1.0 release of RavenDB.  You can download the new alpha here, we have pre-built binaries for Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) and Raspberry PI. Mac OS support is scheduled and will likely be in the next alpha.  The alpha version supports building databases, working with documents, subscriptions, changes, indexing (simple, full text and map/reduce). There have been significant improvements to indexing speed and how they work, memory utilization across the board is much lower and CPU utilization is much reduced. We aren&#x2019;t ready to do full blown benchmarks yet, but a sample scenario that has RavenDB 3.5 pegged at 100% with 45,000 requests per second has RavenDB 4.0 relaxing with 70% CPU with 153,000 requests per second. We would like to get feedback on RavenDB 4.0, and so please download the software and give it a whirl.  You need to make sure that you use both server &amp; client from the same version (older versions will not work with the new server). We actually have a couple of clients, we have the updated client for 4.0, which is pretty much the same as the old client, just updated to work with the new server, and we have a completely new client, which is built to provide much higher performance and apply the same lessons we learned while building the server to the client code. Over time, the new client is going to be the default one, but while we aren&#x2019;t there yet, we want people to have access to it from the get go. Please remember that this is pre-release alpha software, as such, bugs are expected, and should be reported.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A feature is something that your application/service does. Usually we don&#x2019;t give it a lot more thought, but I recently had an interesting discussion about the exact distinctions between a business feature and a technical feature. Let us imagine that we are talking about an application that allow to send snail mail, we already seen it before. A user will call the API and then a few days later a physical letter will show up at your door. So far, it is pretty simple. The question is, what can you offer in addition to expand the business.  For example, we might offer:  Mail tracking &#x2013; providing a way to ensure that the recipient actually got the letter. Snail mail to email &#x2013; getting a physical email, and having that sent to the customer. Those two are obvious extensions to the core business, and from the point of view of the business, it is great. From a technical perspective, that is a whole lot of complexity. You need to integrate with FedEx to handle the mail tracking, and you need to setup some sort of an automated system that will sort the mail, scan it and upload it to the customer&#x2019;s account. The problem is that at this point, you don&#x2019;t really know what kind of reaction those features are going to have. They are both non trivial and in some cases require major capital expenditure to implement and are pretty hard to properly size upfront. So you split it. Instead of doing this as a single feature, you have a business feature and a technical feature. A business feature means that your business offers this service, building that requires research to show that we can actually offer that, check whatever there are legal ramifications (some mail can be sensitive, privacy concerns, etc), check what kind of pricing we can charge, etc.&#xA0; The technical feature is actually implementing all of that. But the key observation here is that you don&#x2019;t actually do the technical implementation, at least not just yet. You do the work around the business end of the feature, and then you announce this feature availability. As in, right now you can track the snail mail, or right now you can get your mail scanned and uploaded. This is done with minimal technical work in the backend, and with the caveat that this still experimental and pricing might change. This isn&#x2019;t cheating, mind you. Once you announced this feature, you wait to see what kind of reaction we&#x2019;ll have. One of the options is that users will really love this feature, and start immediately using it. In this case, you have a good problem, people are flocking to give you money. In the meantime, you have Joe and Samantha, from the local high school working for minimum wage in the afternoon to manually do the work. So you can complete the customer expectations, as you are now working to complete the technical side and automate the whole thing (firing Joe and Samantha along the way).  The key here is that you don&#x2019;t have to do any major upfront investment, in development or in facilities, before you can have this feature. And most of the time, even if it is a major feature, the ramp up time is enough for you to have a pretty good idea about what you actually need to do. And in the meantime, you have a micro service architecture, it is just that the services aren&#x2019;t called FedExTrackingService and ScanAndSortPhysicalMailService but Joe and Samantha.  In other words, you have mechanical Turk the feature until you can teach you system to properly play chess.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was asked recently why I&#x2019;m &#x201C;burning&#x201D; my interview questions by posting them on the blog. That actually has several reasons:  If a candidate reads my blog and is able to produce high quality code based on this, well&#x2026; that is pretty much the job description right there. We just finish another recruitment round, and we aren&#x2019;t planning another one for at least 4 &#x2013; 6 months. The fact that I&#x2019;m posting the answers to a specific question doesn&#x2019;t mean that the the subject matter is closed. For example, let us take this question &amp; answer. Note that this is approachable because&#xA0; there is just standard .NET code. However, the code as posted contains a bug, it is a small one, and all unit tests are passing, but it result is slightly inefficient behavior. Exposing that to a unit test is relatively easy, but going from the failing test back to the root cause and then fixing it would be an interesting investigative technique and good show of skills.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">During the move of RavenDB to Linux we had to deal with the usual share of cross platform bugs. The common ones are things like file system case sensitivity, concatenating paths with \ separators, drive letters, etc. The usual stuff.  Note that the hairy stuff (different threading model, different I/O semantics, etc) I&#x2019;m not counting, we already had dealt with them before.  The real problems had to do with the file systems, in particular, ext3 doesn&#x2019;t support fallocate, which we kind of wanna use to allocate our disk space in advance (which can give the file system information so it can allocate all of that together). But that was pretty straightforward. ENOSUP is clear enough for me, and we could just use ext4, which works.  But this bug was special. To start with, it snuck in and lain there dormant for quite a while, and it was a true puzzle. Put simply, a certain database would work just fine as long as we didn&#x2019;t restart it. On restart, some of its indexes would be in an error state. It took a while to figure out what was going on. At first, we thought that there was some I/O error, but the issue turned out to be much simpler. We assumed that we would be reading indexes in order, in fact, our code output the index directories in such a way that they would be lexically sorted. That worked quite well, and had the nice benefit that on NTFS, we would always read the indexes in order. But on Linux, there is no guaranteed order, and on one particular machine, we indeed hit the out of order issue. And in that case, we had an error raised because we were trying to create an index whose id was too low. Perfectly understandable, when you realize what is going on, and trivial to fix, but quite hard to figure out, because we kept assuming that we did something horrible to the I/O system.</p>
