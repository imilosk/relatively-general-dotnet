            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I showed how we can use a simple text based format to store records, and what it means for reading / writing those records. Searching in such a system means that you have quite a bit of work to do, since you need to scan the whole file to do so. That isn&#x2019;t going to really work for us. So we need to introduce indexes. An index is actually really simple idea. Given that we have the original file, we&#x2019;ll have the following index for username:   Basically, the first column in the index is the value of the username, and those values are sorted, so searching the index has a O(logN) complexity associated with it. Once we have done that, we have the record number, and we can use that to find the position in the file and read the whole record.  All in all, this is pretty basic, right? So why am I dedicating a whole post to this topic? Well, the issue with indexes would be so simple if we were planning on only doing them once. But we want to update them, and that lead to certain issues.&#xA0; While the index above shows only a few records, the actual data size we are talking about here is a million records. That gives us a total index size of about 16MB. What happens if we need to add a new username? In this case, a die hard fan whose username is &#x2018;baseball&#x2019; ? Well, in order to maintain the order, we&#x2019;ll have to put it between the first two entries. Which will require us to move the rest of the data by that same amount. Effectively, in order to add a single entry to the index, we&#x2019;ll have to write 16MB.  In other words, because files don&#x2019;t allow us to dynamically add / remove data from the middle of the file without a lot of expensive I/O, we can&#x2019;t really use flat files for this. It isn&#x2019;t a surprise, but I wanted to start from the bare minimum and walk us up in the complexity hierarchy as we discover why we need those things. So we need to find a file format that will allow us to update things without having to shuffle the entirety of the file every time we do that. Looking at the literature, I can compare the flat file approach to having a sorted array, and it has the same problems. The typical solution for that is to use a binary search tree. In this way, we always have the root of the tree at beginning of the file, and use offsets to jump around in the file according to where we need to go. The code for searching in this kind of file looks like this:  Note that this is with all error handling removed, and while it gives us what we wants, this solution has several issues. To start with, if we want to have good performance, we&#x2019;ll need to balance the tree on inserts / deletes, and that can be complex. Not only that, but it also means that the number of file operations that we&#x2019;ll actually perform is pretty high here. This isn&#x2019;t good, because files reside on (very slow) hardware, so we probably don&#x2019;t want to use that. Instead, we need to find something that will allow us to do a lot less seeks in the file (which takes about 10 &#x2013; 20 ms on a standard HDD), and can handle concurrent work better (won&#x2019;t be fighting over the disk head position so much). We also need to make sure that the amount of work that we have to do when we modify something is minimal. In the case of a balanced tree, the amount of work to balance it can be extremely high, and the number of places you&#x2019;ll have to jump around (thus, seek) is incredible.  In the next post, we&#x2019;ll discuss persistent algorithm options here, and what we should use to store the data.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Reading the comments in this Reddit thread gave me a bit of a pause. Mostly because of the level of knowledge about what I consider basic stuff. Then again, I can&#x2019;t do any UI that doesn&#x2019;t involve the &lt;table/&gt; tag, so I guess that make sense. So I decided to do something about this lack of knowledge. In this series, I&#x2019;m going to go over just those kind of details that I consider essential to understand how databases actually work. Imagine that you had a program that needed to persist some state. Let us say that we need to keep track of users and how often they log into the system. You would typically use your database of choice to do so, and you&#x2019;ll be flying away in no time. But for this series, we are assuming that no such software exist, so we have to roll our own persistence solution. The simplest solution for this that is to simply store the data as a CSV file. Here is what we end up doing:   Now, this has several advantages, simplicity being a key one, but it also suffer from pretty much every possible disadvantage. Let us consider the following simple scenarios:  I want to update the last login date I want to update the user name I want to search by user name I want to get records sorted by last login date I want to add a record I want to delete a record Oh, and I want to do all of the above when I have a million records.  CSV is a great thing, if the number of records we have is small. To be fair, on modern hardware, a million records is small, but we&#x2019;ll ignore this for reasons that will be explained in the following posts. Let us look at how the file actually looks like, shall we?   Now, if we want to update the last login date for Oren, that is pretty easy. We can do that using the following sequence of operations:   I&#x2019;m intentionally using C API here, because that is what actually is going on, and we need to understand and work with that. Notice a few things that are going on in here. We open the file, seek to the date&#x2019;s position on the first data row, and then we update the date with a value that has the same size. Finally, we close the file. Are mission has met success! Let all retire somewhere for breakfast (I&#x2019;m writing this at 5:20 AM after a &#x201C;night&#x201D; that had no darkness while being in NDC Oslo. Looking out the window I see clear skies, great visibility and absolutely no people. It feels like the opening scene in a Zombie movie. Anyway, before breakfast can commence, let us try to update the user name. Arava, while being an awesome German Shepherdess, has chosen a bad username. No matter what I call her when she chew a tennis ball in the bed again. Let us see what we&#x2019;ll need to update her username to the more neutral &#x201C;dog&#x201D;.   Now, you might notice that I&#x2019;m somewhat cheating here. The problem is that the size of the values are different, but there is no real way for us to just cut some part of the file, so I&#x2019;m abusing the fact that the CSV parser will ignore any whitespace at the beginning of the value to &#x201C;trim&#x201D; the value. But what happen if I didn&#x2019;t want to shorten the username? What if I wanted the username to be shepherdess? Well, in this case, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do that. I don&#x2019;t have enough space, and if I tried, I would overwrite the next record, and probably corrupt the whole file. Bummer. Typically, at this point we have to abandon the simplicity of a CSV file and move over to a slightly better format. In this case, we can go with fixed size records. In other words, we&#x2019;ll define the maximum size for each field. Here is what this looks like:      This format is harder for humans to generate, because if we do this manually we have to count spaces, etc. But this is actually much easier for us to work with. We have the following format:  Full Name &#x2013; Max 16 chars User Name &#x2013; Max 12 chars Last Login &#x2013; Exactly 19 chars Computing where to write the last login date for a particular record is now simply the following math:  (16 &#x2B; 12 &#x2B; 19 &#x2B; 2) * NumberOfRecords &#x2B; 16 &#x2B; 12 &#x2B; 42 42 is the length in bytes of the two first rows. And the &#x2B;2 is for the line terminator. So far so good, now we have a file format, and the ability to work with it. Which is great, and even quite convenient for us. But it isn&#x2019;t really suitable for doing anything but full scans of the file. Here is the logic for searching a record by username:   By the way, I&#x2019;m doing this in C also because it is fun, it has been a while since I did C, so it might be wrong.  As you can&#xA0; see, the cost of actually doing any sort of operation in this format is simple, O(N). That isn&#x2019;t going to work for us. In the next post in this series, I&#x2019;m going to talk about indexes, and how they work. After that, we will start talking about the actual on disk format, and what it is impacted by.</p>

A sharded database is one where the data is split among multiple nodes. To make things simple, we will assume that each datum in the database has a 64 bits key associated with it, and we are interested in distributing the information evenly among the nodes. This can be done using Jump Consistent Hashing (see paper for details), and can be implemented using the following simple C# function:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

This function ensures that roughly 1/N of the data items in the databases will require movement to a new node when it is introduced. Which is pretty much exactly what we want in a sharded environment. However, this function doesn&#x2019;t help us figure out what to move.&#xA;Assume that we already have a database that has 5 nodes, and ten billion data items spread across all 5 nodes, spread according to the consistent jump function. Because of load, we need to add additional 2 nodes to the cluster, and we need to move 2/7 (2.8 billion data items) of the cluster data to the new nodes. However, since moving the data items alone is going to be costly, we want to avoid scanning through all 10 billion items in all nodes to figure out which ones we need to ship to the new nodes, and which ones should remain with the current node.&#xA;Suggest a way that will allow the database to find out which data items need to be moved to the new nodes, without having to scan through all of them. In other words, anything that requires O(number of items in each node) is out.&#xA;You are rated on the impact of your suggestion on the overall cluster behavior. The cheaper your option, the better. You are free to store additional information (at cluster creation / modification, as data items are entered into the cluster / deleted, etc) if this can help you, but be aware that any impact on standard operations (reads &amp; writes) should be minimal and well justified.&#xA;You only need to consider adding nodes to the cluster, removing nodes from the cluster is not required.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For the actual question, see the original post. So the first thing that we need to decide is what will be the data format on the tire. Since we have only 32KB to work with, we need to consider the actual storage.  32KB is small enough to fit in a unsigned short, so all the references we&#x2019;ll used will be shorts. We also need to store a bit of metadata, so we&#x2019;ll use the first 4 bytes as the header for just that.  ushort SpaceUsed;  ushort LastAllocation; Now that we have this, we need to decide how to store the actual data.

We use a negative size to indicate a delete marker. So basically, now we have a pretty trivial way to allocate memory, and we can implement the trie as we would normally do. There are a few wrinkles, however. Deleting the memory doesn&#x2019;t actually make it eligible for reuse, and it is quite likely to get fragmented easily. In order to handle that, we will track the amount of space that is used, and if we got to the end of the space, we&#x2019;ll check the UsedSpace value. If this is still too little, we can abort, there is no available space here. However, if we go to the end of the buffer, but we have free space available, we can do the following:  Scan the buffer for available spots (find available locations that have negative size).  Failing that, we will copy the data to a temporary buffer, then re-add everything to the buffer from scratch. In other words, we defrag it. Another issue we have is that the maximum size we can allocate is 127. This value is big enough so most actual strings can fit into it nicely, but a trie already has the property that a large string might be broken into pieces, we&#x2019;ll just cut each node in the trie to a max size of 127. Actually, the max size is likely to be less than that, because there is also some information that we need to keep track per entry.  byte NumberOfChildren;  byte Flags; // node type, (internal, leaf or both)  ushort ChildrenPosition; So in practice we have about 123 bytes to work with for the length. Note that we don&#x2019;t store the string value of the node&#x2019;s length (we can get that from the allocation information), and that we store the actual children in an array that is stored separately. This allows us to easily add items to the trie as child nodes. If the node is a leaf node, we also need to store the actual value (which is 8 bytes), we store that information at the end of the value (giving us 115 bytes for that section of the value). All in all, there is going to be a bit of pointer arithmetic and bit counting, but is likely to be a pretty simple implementation.  Note that additional optimizations would be to try align everything so it would fit into a cache line, trying to place nodes near their children (which are more likely to be followed), etc.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently run into this blog post Scaling to 100M: MySQL is a Better NoSQL (from about 6 months ago) and cringed, hard. Go ahead and read it, I&#x2019;ll wait. There are so much stuff going on here that I disagree with that I barely even know where to start. I think that what annoys me the most about this post is that it attempts to explain a decision, but does that in a way that clearly shows a lack of depth in the decision making process. I absolutely agree on the first section, you shouldn&#x2019;t make your database choice based on hype, or by whatever it is &#x201C;everyone&#x201D; is doing. But saying that &#x201C;if everyone jumps off the roof&#x2026;&#x201D; is generally a bad argument to make when literally everyone jumps off the roof (maybe it is on fire, maybe it is 1 meter drop, maybe it has a pool to jump into, etc). If this sounds ridiculous, this is because it is. In particular, I take offense at:  This post will explain why we&#x2019;ve found that using MySQL for the key/value use case is better than most of the dedicated NoSQL engines, and provide guidelines to follow when using MySQL in this way. Then they go to list some of their requirements. I&#x2019;m assuming that you read the post, so I&#x2019;ll answer it directly.  The dataset they are talking about is about 210GB, and is composed of about 100 million records. In other words, you can fit that entire thing to memory in an AWS instance such as d2.8xlarge, at a cost of about 1.5$ / hour for a 3 year plan. Read this again, their dataset can actually fit in memory. And even with that, they report a rate of 200K request per minute, which is funny, because the typical metric is looking at requests per second. At which point we are talking about around 3,400 req/second. But they have three database servers, so we are probably talking about around a thousand requests per second overall. Oh, and they report an average of 1 &#x2013; 1.5 ms latency numbers. Leaving aside the fact that averages means nothing (a percentiles summary would work much better), that is a really long time to process a single request.  I really liked this one:  Our existing system has scaling / throughput / concurrency / latency figures that are impressive for any NoSQL engine. No, it isn&#x2019;t. Just to give you some idea, assuming even distribution of the data, each site entry is about 2KB in size, so their throughput numbers are less than 10 MB / second.  Now, let us talk about the ways that their approach is actually broken. To start with, they have statements such as this one:  Serial keys impose locks&#x2026; &#x2026;Also notice that we are not using serial keys; instead, we are using varchar(50), which stores client-generated GUID values&#x2014;more about that in the next section. I mean, okay, so you have no idea how to generate serial keys without requiring locks, because things like that are so hard. I can think of several ways without even trying hard (Snowflake, HiLo, ranges, guid.comb, to name just a few). Now, why would you want want to take the time to do something like this? Because using a GUID is&#x2026; how shall we say it, a horrible idea!  GUIDs are not sorted, which means that you are inserting (at a high rate) a lot of entries to the table, which forces a lot of page splits, which results in a bigger and deeper B&#x2B;Tree, which result in a higher cost to find records, which is what you were trying to prevent in the first place. Allowing sequential inserts can improve your insert performance (and afterward, the query speed) by orders of magnitude. So that is most certainly something that you really want to invest the 30 minutes it takes to code a sequential number solution from scratch, if you can use the literally dozens of ready made solutions. But the thing that is really takes the cake is the fact that all of their queries take the following form:   So a sub-select is required to run this query (which with most reasonable query optimizers will be exactly equivalent to the query plan of an inner join), but the usage of TEXT data in the site information will mean at least another disk seek (to load the actual value) after the relevant row was located. Now, it is possible that MySQL was a good decision for their use case, but this is:  Not an optimal usage of MySQL in the first place. Small data set, can fit on one machine, can actually fit into memory Inflexible system, very hard to change (needing another queryable field is now a major operation) Low overall performance That last one is very important. Just to give you some idea, for the size that they are talking about, we can probably handle the full 200,000 request per minute that they are talking about on their three way cluster using a single machine, and doing that in one second. Assuming that I&#x2019;m trying to find a dedicated solution to the problem (trie for the routing, simple memory mapped storage for the actual site data, where the routing trie will contain the position of the data). Of course, you would be crazy to do that. Just having a speedy solution for this is not enough, you also need to handle all of the rest of the associated costs of a database (operations, metrics, backup/restore, replication, etc). But the provided solution is just Not Good.</p>

The outer loop runs as long as we the database runs, and then we index until we run out of stuff to do. When we run out, we&#x2019;ll wait. During that time, the thread is paused, and unless a new document comes for the collections that this index covers, there is nothing that needs to be done. In the other case, we are actually handling a web socket connection, so there are some differences, but for the most part, this is pretty much the same. We use an async event, and we need to keep the connection alive, so if we have nothing to do, we&#x2019;ll wake up every 5 seconds and just write a new line to the socket, keeping it alive. Nitpicker corner: this isn&#x2019;t new, and it is about the simplest and most obvious concurrency strategy you can have. But because it is the simplest, it also have some major advantages. The code does very little actual concurrency. We can reason about the code quite easily. We keep having to dumb down our code to similar patterns, because this is much easier to maintain over the long run.</p>
