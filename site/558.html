            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here is an interesting problem that I am facing. I have a pretty good working knowledge of computing, and while I can usually manage to get the gist of a new technology in a short amount of time, that is only useful for talking about it, not actually applying that. I am currently trying to figure out the parts where I am missing, and plug the holes. And I am running into a bit of a problem here.  A case in point, I can read Java, and I can probably write C# code in Java, but I can&#x2019;t write a Java application. Not for lack of technical skills, but just because I lack the practical knowledge on how to do so.&#xA0; The problem is that it is going to take too long for me to slog through everything myself, especially since my main problems are in things like IDEs and usage patterns, which aren&#x2019;t really stuff that you learn from reading about it.  I am thinking on taking a Java course, not so much for the content of the course, as the ability to actually build Java apps in an environment where I can ask questions. On the other hand, picking the right course is problematic, I am not going to sit through &#x201C;this is a for loop&quot;, but I don&#x2019;t want to be the guy with the blank stare.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had the chance to take part of a multi people conversation on Google Wave.  Overall, I have to say that it was an interesting chat experience, but it lacks some very important things. Chief among them, if you are going to allow multiple people to edit at the same time and expect to give a real time experience, you have to provide good experience when people are editing &#x201C;beyond the fold&#x201D; (the areas of the documents that I am not currently viewing.  Replaying stuff is nice, but it isn&#x2019;t working for the real time edit portion, which is the most interesting bit.  Overall, I have to say that I found it to be somewhat like IRC, and I dropped out of that years ago, because it had a real time requirements that I could not justify. I much rather use something that is by nature async, with a sync-like experience, like email or twitter.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In most situations, I like to think about my apps as a set of composite Lego blocks. Ignoring the infrastructure bits, here is how Uber Prof is structured internally:&#xA; &#xA;I have a set of message processors, which work of low level event messages, detect patterns in those messages and turn them into high level events. Next, I have the Model Building part, which takes the high level information and handle correlation between the different events. I then have analyzers, which are branched out of the model building processor to perform the various analysis actions that I need.&#xA;The idea is to try, as much as possible, to build the system out of identical parts, and when I need additional functionality in a given location, I create another extension point and plug in more single use classes at that place.&#xA;All of this is being orchestrated by a container that can provide those dependencies, so the act of creating a new class is also the sole act required to add the new feature to the system.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In Gmail, right now, I have 65,290 (non spam) messages, stretching back over 3 years. I routinely (once a week or so) need to refer to something that is at least six months old. I just had to dug in old backups to find an instant message log from 2006, because I had some information there that could not be found anywhere else.  My take on that is that yes, history matters, a lot. Moreover, being able to get to that history matters as well.   Today, I cannot imagine how I would try to manage myself without Gmail there to help me, being able to efficiently &amp; easily search my entire history is the number one reason I love it so much.  Oh, and also important, make sure you have the backups :-) That IM log that I was talking about survived about 4 different computer transfers.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that I am really sensitive for is friction. And anytime that I run into that, I am doing an evaluation about how much it is going to cost to remove that. Thee are two sides for this evaluation. There is the pure monetary/time side, and then there is the pure opportunities lost side.  The usual evaluation is &#x201C;it takes 3 minutes to do so manually, and would take a week to resolve in an automatic way&#x201D;, assuming a standard 40 hours week, we would need to do something for 800 times before it make sense resolve that automatically.   The problem is ignoring the opportunities lost angle. One of the things that most people do not usually consider is that we tend to avoid things that are painful.   If adding content to a website requires you to commit changes to SVN and then log in to a server and update the site, that is about 3 additional minutes that you topped to something that is probably pretty minor. If you are on a slow connection, those can be pretty frustrating 3 minutes. That means that editing the site get batched, so a lot of minor edits are bundled together, until the 3 minutes overhead become insignificant. That means that the site gets updated less often.  If maintaining two profiles of the same application requires that you would merge between slightly different branches (a pretty painful process), they are not going to be in sync. Building a way which allows a single codebase development for multiple profiles is a pretty significant investment, on the other hand. And it introduce complexity into the software.  If committing is going to hit a network resource (and thus take a bit longer), you are going to commit less often. If branching&#x2026; but you get the point, don&#x2019;t you?  If releasing your software is a manual process (even to the point of just promoting a CI build to release status), you aren&#x2019;t going to release very often.   Those are just a few recent examples that I have run to where friction was the deciding factor. In all cases, I put in the time to reduce the friction to the lowest possible level. What I usually look for is the opportunities lost cost, because those tend to be pretty significant.    I don&#x2019;t think about releasing the profiler versions, and I released 20 times in the last three days (5 different builds, times 4 different profiles). The build process for the profiler had me write several custom tools (including my own bloody CI server, for crying out load, a daily build site, upload and registration tools, etc). That decision has justified itself a hundred times over, by ensuring that my work isn&#x2019;t being hampered by release management, and it a very rapid turn around for releases.  That, in turn, means that we get a lot more confidence from customers (we had a problem and it was resolved in 2 hours). There is actually a separate problem here, that we release too often, but I consider that a better alternative than slow response times for customers.  Supporting Linq to Sql as a second target in NH Prof was something that we could do in three days flat. In practice, it took over a month to get to a position where we could properly release it. The time difference was dedicated to doing it right. And no, I am not talking about architectural beauty, or any such thing.  The three days target time for Linq to SQL implies branching the code base and simply making the changes inline. There is relatively very little change from the NH Prof version, and we could just make it all work in a short amount of time.   I am talking about doing it in a way that introduce no additional friction to our work. Right now I am supporting 4 different profiles (NHibernate, Hibernate, Linq to SQL, Entity Framework), and in my wild dreams I am thinking of having 10 or more(!). Frictionless processes means that the additional cost of support each new profile is vastly reduced.   Having different branches for different profiles was considered and almost immediately rejected, it would introduce too much friction, confusion and pain into the development process. Instead, we went with the route on having a single code base that is being branched automatically by the build process. It means that we have a slightly more complex infrastructure, but it also means that we can do it once and touch it only very rarely.  Does it pay off? I would say it does just in terms of not having to consider merging between the different branches whenever I make a change or a bug fix. But it is more than that.  A week ago I didn&#x2019;t have the Entity Framework Profiler, today it is in a private beta, and in a week or two it is going to go to public beta. All that time spent on integrating Linq to SQL paid itself off when we could just plug in a new profile without really thinking about it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, here is a new thingie, L2SProf can now detect transactions.  Both standard SQL transactions:     And also distributed transactions using System.Transactions:     This is an interesting feature, because you can see how the use of different transaction strategies have a big impact on how you structure your code.  For example, with L2S, it seems like you are encouraged to read outside of a transaction. Something that I, as an NHibernate user, find quite odd.</p>
