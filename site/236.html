            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We have been testing RavenDB in the harshest possible ways we can envision. Anything from simulating hardware failures to corrupting the network data to putting as much load as possible on the system. This is done as part of a long running test suite that has been running for the last few months. We have been stepping up the kind of things that we are doing in attempt to identify the weak points in RavenDB.One of the interesting failure modes that we need to handle is what happens when the amount of work that is asked from the system exceeds the amount of resources that are available to it. At this point, what we want to do is to start failing gracefully. What we don&#x2019;t want to do is to have the entire system grind to a halt of the server crashing. There are problems with the idea that we can detect when we re in low resource mode and react accordingly. To start with, it is really hard. If the user paid for a fast machine, and we are running at 99% CPU, should we start rejecting requests? The users are actually getting their money&#x2019;s worth from the hardware, so it make no sense to do that. Second, what is low resource mode? No space in hard disk is quite easy, actually. We detect that and error and everything is fine. High CPU is not something that we want to react to, it might be that we are actively handling a spike of traffic, or just making full use of the system.Memory is another constrained resource, and here we run into our toughest problems. RavenDB uses memory mapped files for a lot of its storage needs, which means that high memory usage is something that we want, because it means that we are actually using the memory of the machine. Now, the OS can choose to evict such data from memory at any time very cheaply, so if there is a true memory pressure, we don&#x2019;t need to worry, since there is a good degradation path for us.The problem is that this isn&#x2019;t the only cause for high memory usage. In additional to the actual memory we are using (the working set) there is also the commit charge for the system. I&#x2019;m probably going to have a separate post to talk about the details of memory management from the OS point of view. The commit charge is how much memory the OS promised all the applications in the system. It is very common for applications to ask for a lot more memory than they actually need, which mean that the OS will usually not actually allocate the memory immediately. Instead, it will just record the promise to give it at a future date.On Windows, the maximum commit charge is the size of the RAM and the page file(s) and Windows will flat out refuse to commit memory beyond that limit. When you are working on a system that is heavily overburdened, it is very possible to hit that limit, which is when&#x2026; interesting things will happen. In particular, we need to consider the behavior of failure to commit memory when we need to increase the size of the thread stack. In this case, even though the size of the stack is reasonable, there is no way to get more memory for the stack, and we&#x2019;ll get a a fatal Stack Overflow exception. It looks like this exact behavior is very explicitly called in the code. This means that under low memory conditions (which may be low committed memory, not real low memory) opening a new thread, which may need to allocate / expand its stack, is a very dangerous behavior. We have some code in RavenDB that spawn a new thread per connection for certain types of very long running server to server connections. Combine that we the fact that under such high load you&#x2019;ll typically see disconnection and recovery by establishing a new connection (requiring a new thread) and you can see the problem. Under such load we&#x2019;ll hit both conditions. Low committed memory and spawning of new threads, and then it is just a game of whatever it will be regular (and handled) allocation that fails or if it would be the stack extension that would fail, resulting in fatal error.We are handling this by reusing the threads now, which seems to offer much greater stability in our test case.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Sometimes you see the impossible. In one of our scenarios, we saw a cluster that had such a bad case of split brain that it came near to fracturing the very boundaries of space &amp; time. In a three node cluster, we have one node that looked to be fine. It connected to all the other nodes and was the cluster leader. The other two nodes, however, were not in the cluster and in fact, they were showing signs that they never were in the cluster.What was really strange was that we took the other two machines down and the first node was still showing a successful cluster. We looked deeper and realized that it wasn&#x2019;t actually a healthy situation, in fact, this node was very rapidly switching between leader and follower mode. It took a bit of time to figure out what was going on, but the root cause was DNS. We had the three nodes on separate DNS (a.oren.development.run, b.oren.development.run, c.oren.development.run) and they were setup to point to the three machines. However, we have previously used the same domain names to run a cluster on the first machine only. Because of the way DNS updates, whenever the machine at a.oren.development.run would try to connect to b.oren.development.run it would actually connect to itself. At this point, A would tell B that it is the leader. But A is B, so A would respond by becoming a follower (because it was told it should, by itself). Because it became a follower, it disconnected from itself. After a timeout, it would become leader again, and the cycle would continue. Every time that the server would get up, it would whip itself down again. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a leader&#x201D;, &#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m a leader&#x201D;, etc.This is a fun thing to discover. We had to trace pretty deep to figure out that the problem was in the DNS cache (since the DNS itself was properly updated).We fixed things so we now recognize if we are talking to ourselves and error properly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This blog post was a very interesting read. It talks about the ipify service and how it grew. It is an interesting post, but what really caught my eye was the performance details. In particular, this talks about exceeding 30 billions of requests per month. The initial implementation used Node, and couldn&#x2019;t get more than 30 req/second or so and the current version seems to be in Go and can handle about 2,000 requests a second.I&#x2019;m interested in performance so I decided to see why my results would be. I very quickly wrote the simplest possible implementation using Kestrel and threw that on a t2.nano in AWS. I&#x2019;m pretty sure that this is the equivalent for the dyno that he is using. I then spun another t2.small instance and used that to bench the performance of the system. All I did was just run the code with release mode on the t2.nano, and here are the results:&quot;So we get 25,000 requests a second and some pretty awesome latencies under very high load on a 1 CPU / 512 MB machine. For that matter, here are the top results from midway through on the t2.nano machine:I should say that the code I wrote was quick and dirty in terms of performance. It allocates several objects per request and likely can be improved several times over, but even so, these are nice numbers. Primarily because there is actually so little that needs to be done here. To be fair, a t2.nano machine is meant for burst traffic and is not likely to be able to sustain such load over time, but even when throttled by an order of magnitude, it will still be faster than the Go implementation .</p>
