            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The basis of how Lucene work is tf&#x2013;idf, short for term frequency&#x2013;inverse document frequency. You can read about it here. It is pretty complex, but it is explained in detailed in the Lucene docs. It all fall down to:  For now, I want to look at the tf() function. The default implementation is in DefaultSimilarity.Tf, and is defined as:  That isn&#x2019;t really helpful, however. Not without knowing what freq is.&#xA0; And I&#x2019;m pretty sure that Sqrt isn&#x2019;t cheap, which probably explains this:  So it caches the score function, and it appears that the tf() is purely based on the count, not on anything else. Before I&#x2019;ll go and find out what is done with the score cache, let&#x2019;s look at the weight value. This is calculated here:  And idf stands for inverse document frequency.&#xA0; That is defined by default to be:  And the actual implementation as:  And the caller for that is:  So, we get the document doc frequency of a term, that is, in how many documents this term shows, and the number of all the documents, and that is how we calculate the idf. So far, so good. But how about that doc frequency? This is one of the things that we store in the terms info file. But how does that get calculated? I decided to test this with:  This should generate 3 terms, two with a frequency of 1 and one with a frequency of 2. Now, to figure out how this is calculated. That part is a real mess.  During indexing, there is a manually maintained hash table that contains information about each unique term, and when we move from one document to another, we write the number of times each term appeared in the document. For fun, this is written to what I think is an in memory buffer for safe keeping, but it is really hard to follow. Anyway, I now know enough about how that works for simple cases, where everything happens in a single segment. Now let us look what happens when we use multiple segments. It is actually quite trivial. We just need to sum the term frequency each term across all segments. This gets more interesting when we involve deletes. Because of the way Lucene handle deletes, it can&#x2019;t really handle this scenario, and deleting a document do not remove its frequency counts for the terms that it had. That is the case until the index does a merge, and fix everything that way. So now I have a pretty good idea about how it handled the overall term frequency. Note that this just gives you the number of times this term has been seen across all documents. What about another important quality, the number of times this term appears in a specific document? Those are stored in the frq file, and they are accessible during queries. This is then used in conjunction with the overall term frequency to generate the boost factor per result.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing my trip into the Lucene codebase, now I&#x2019;m looking into the process indexing are happening. Interestingly enough, that is something that we never really had to look at before. It is quite clear that Lucene is heavily meant for utilizing additional threads for improving overall indexing speed. You can see it in the number of per thread state that exist all over the indexing code. That is also meant to reduce memory consumption, as far as I can see.   The real stuff happens in the ProcessDocument() where we have a chain of DocFieldConsumerPerThread and TermsHashConsumerPerThread which actually do the work. Then the real work is happening on a per field level in DocInverterPerField, where the analyzer is actually called. The process in which the analyzers return values for the text is interesting. There are &#x201C;attributes&#x201D; that are added to the stream, per token, and they are used to get the relevant values. I assume that this allows to have different levels of analyzers.  This way, you can have analyzers that don&#x2019;t deal with offesets or positions, etc. And the actual processing of this is done in a chain that appears to be:  Freq Prox Term Vectors  But that isn&#x2019;t something that I really care about now. I want to see how Lucene writes the actual terms. This is being written in the TermsInfoWriter, which took some time to find.  Terms are stored in a prefix compressed mode (sorted, obviously), and there is the actual terms, and an index into the terms, which allows for faster seeking into the file. This is actually done here:  This is a single term written to the file. A lot of the stuff Lucene does (prefixes, VInt, etc) are done in the name of conserving space, and it reminds me greatly of LevelDB&#x2019;s SST. In fact, the way terms are stored is pretty much an SST, except that this happens to be on multiple files. Pretty much the entire behavior and all the implications are the same. It also means that searching on this is fast, because the data is sorted, but pretty complex. And it also explains a lot about the actual exposed API that it has. I think that I have a pretty good idea on how things work now. I want to now go back up and look at specific parts of how it works&#x2026; but that is going to be the next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Yes, I know that you are probably getting geared up to hear about some crazy setup, and in some manner, it is crazy. My distributed build system is this:  Yep, that is me manually distributing the build to do a cross check on a reasonable time frame. I&#x2019;ve mentioned before that our build time is atrocious. With over 3,500 tests, this is no longer a feasible alternative to just run them normally. So we started parallel efforts (pun intended), to reduce the time it takes the system to build and reduce individual test times as well as the ability to parallelize things. We are actually at the point where we can run concurrent tests, even those we previously had to distribute. And we can even do that with replicated tests, which are the ones usually taking the longest. But what we&#x2019;ll probably have in the end is just a bunch of test projects (currently we have ~5) that we will run on different machines at the same time. We are using Team City for build system, and I know that it has capabilities in this regard, but I&#x2019;ve never actually looked into that. We&#x2019;re going to be pretty busy in the next couple of weeks, so I thought that this would be a good time to ask.  My current thinking is:  One build that would actually do the compilation, etc. Then branch off that to a build per test project, which can run on different agents Then a build on top of that that can actually deploy the build. Any recommendations on that? We are going to need 5 &#x2013; 7 agents to run the tests in parallel. Any recommendations on how to get those? Ideally I would like to avoid having to pay for those machines to sit idle 60% &#x2013; 80% of the time. Any other alternatives?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, it is finally here, it has been ten years since I started blogging. My first blog was on April&#x2019;s 1st 2004, and somehow, we are a decade later. Usually it is time for introspective, and careful thought about what was and what will be, but I&#x2019;m having no time for that. Instead, I wanted to let you know that we just finished signing with Lucas Film (well, it said Disney on the contract, but I&#x2019;m a geek, so I&#x2019;ll go with the more impressive title) for a movie about Hibernating Rhinos. The idea is basically similar to the Social Network, but much better. I&#x2019;m trying to see if I can get Jesse Eisenberg to play there. And I got a budget for 999 ravens to be released in a flock at one of the scenes! We&#x2019;ll show a trailer for the movie (purely computer generated, so far) at our Conference in a week.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I realized lately that I wanted to know a lot more about exactly how Lucene is storing data on disk. Oh, I know the general stuff about segments and files, etc. But I wanted to know the actual bits &amp; bytes. So I started tracing into Lucene and trying to figure out what it is doing. And, by the way, the only thing that the Lucene.NET codebase is missing is this sign:  At any rate, this is how Lucene writes the segment file. Note that this is done in a CRC32 signed file:  And the info write method is:      Today, I would probably use a JSON file for something like that (bonus point, you know if it is corrupted and it is human readable), but this code was written in 2001, so that explains it. This is the format of the format of a segment file, and the segments.gen file is generated using:  Moving on to actually writing data, I created ten Lucene documents and wrote them. Then just debugged through the code to see what will happen. It started by creating _0.fdx and _0.fdt files. The .fdt is for fields, the fdx is for field indexes. Both of those files are used when writing the stored fields. This is the empty operation, writing an unstored field.   This is how fields are actually stored:  And then it ends up in:   Note that this particular data goes in the fdt file, while the fdx appears to be a quick way to go from a known document id to the relevant position in the fdx file. As I was going through the code, I did some searches, and found a very detailed explanation of the actual file format in the docs. That is really nice and quite informative, however, just seeing how the &#x201C;let us take the documents and make them searchable&#x201D; part is quite interesting. Lucene has a lot of chains of responsibilities going through. And it is also quite interesting to see the design choices that were made. Unfortunately, Lucene is very much wedded to its file format, and making changes to it isn&#x2019;t going to be possible, which is a shame, since it impacts quite a lot of the way Lucene works in general.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">An interesting question that keeps popping up is how to re-reduce the results of a map/reduce. That is really nice feature on the surface, but it has a lot of implications, for example, when / how you run the 2nd reduce, can you chain only 1 time, or multiple times , what happens when there are a lot of reduce results, etc. But most of the time, what people want is to be able to do aggregation on the map/reduce results without too much hassle, and they don&#x2019;t have a lot of aggregated results or they are fine with waiting for them if they are very large. And we have a really nice solution for that scenario. You start by defining the base map/reduce operation, like so:  Note that we need to also output the fields that we care about reducing further. In this case, we start by reducing to postal code, but we keep the city, region and country options as well. Then, we define a transformer. Note that this is a special transformer, in that it has a group by in it, and it takes some parameters from outside.  Using those two together, we can now get the following results&#x2026; Raw map/reduce output:  With loc = City, we get:  With loc = Country, we get:  Tada, we have reduced further the result of a map/reduce operation. Now, this is subject to the usual limitations of RavenDB paging, in that it will only go through the only 1024 results. That can be a problem, but that is why RavenDB has the Streaming API. You can use streaming on a map/reduce index with a transformer (and even apply parameters on top of that). That end up giving you the ability to run a re-reduction on top of a map/reduce index regardless of size.  Of course, on very large result sets, that can take quite a while, but that is expected and usually fine. For that matter, if you need to, you can chain the stream into a bulk insert, and get the re-reduction in that manner.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rafal&#xA0; an Ben Foster commented on my previous post with some ideas on how to deal with incremental updates to map/reduce indexes. Rafal said:  Actually, it&#x27;s quite simple if you can &#x27;reverse&#x27; the mapping operation (for given key find all documents matching that key): you just delete aggregate record with specified key and run incremental map-reduce on all matching documents. In today&#x27;s example, you would delete the aggregate with key=&#x27;oren&#x27; and then run map reduce with a query: db.items.mapReduce(map,reduce, { out: {reduce: &#x2018;distinct_item_names&#x2019;}, query: {name: &#x27;oren&#x27; } }); And Ben said:  It&#x27;s worth mentioning that I was able to get the MongoDB map-reduce collections updating automatically (insert/update/delete) by monitoring the MongoDB OpLog &#x2026; &#x2026;and listen for new documents in the OpLog which could then be used to re-execute an incremental Map-Reduce. And while this looks right, this actually can&#x2019;t possibly work. I&#x2019;ll start from Rafal&#x2019;s suggestion first. He suggest just issuing the following set of commands whenever we delete something from the database:      1: db.distinct_item_names.remove({name: &#x27;oren&#x27; } });   2: db.items.mapReduce(map,reduce, { out: {reduce: &#x2018;distinct_item_names&#x2019;}, query: {name: &#x27;oren&#x27; } });&#xA;And yes, that will actually work, as long as you are careful to never do this concurrently. Because if you do run this concurrently&#x2026; well, the best you can hope is no data, but the liker scenario is data corruption.&#xA;But this actually gets better, deletes are annoying, but they are a relatively simple case to process. You have updates to deal with too. We&#x2019;ll assume that we are watching the oplog to get notified when this happens. Here is an MongoDB oplog entry&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: {   2:   &quot;ts&quot;: {   3:     &quot;t&quot;: 1286821984000,   4:     &quot;i&quot;: 1   5:   },   6:   &quot;h&quot;: &quot;1633487572904743924&quot;,   7:   &quot;op&quot;: &quot;u&quot;,   8:   &quot;ns&quot;: &quot;items&quot;,   9:   &quot;o2&quot;: {  10:     &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;4cb35859007cc1f4f9f7f85d&quot;  11:   },  12:   &quot;o&quot;: {  13:     &quot;$set&quot;: {  14:       &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Eini&quot;  15:     }  16:   }  17: }&#xA;As you can see, we an update operation (op: u) on a specific document (o2._id) with the specified update (o.$set). That is really great, and it is utterly useless for our purposes. In this case, we updated the name from Oren to Eini, so we would like to be able to run this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: db.distinct_item_names.remove({name: &#x27;oren&#x27; } });   2: db.distinct_item_names.remove({name: eini&#x27; } });   3: db.items.mapReduce(map,reduce, { out: {reduce: &#x2018;distinct_item_names&#x2019;}, query: {name: &#x27;oren&#x27; } });   4: db.items.mapReduce(map,reduce, { out: {reduce: &#x2018;distinct_item_names&#x2019;}, query: {name: eini&#x27; } });&#xA;Except that we don&#x2019;t have any way to get the old value out from the oplog. And this still isn&#x2019;t going to work concurrently. &#xA;But let us say that we decided to have a watcher process monitor the oplog somehow, and it will ensure no concurrency of those requests. Now you have to deal with fun issues like: &#x201C;what happens if the watcher process recycle?&#x201D;&#xA0; How do you keep your place in the oplog (and remember, the oplog is capped, stuff you haven&#x2019;t seen might be removed if they are beyond the specified size. &#xA;And&#x2026; to be frank, once we have done all of that, this is still the easy part. One of the reasons that you want to do this work in the first place is to deal with large amount of data. But you cannot assume that you&#x2019;ll have even distribution of the data. &#xA;One bug request that came against the RavenDB map/reduce implementation was a map/reduce index on the US Census data. That is ~300 million documents, and the index the user wanted to build was a map/reduce group by the state. You have states like California, with more than 30 million people in it, and you realize that you don&#x2019;t want to have to re-do the map/reduce over the entire 30&#x2B; million documents that you have there. In RavenDB, under this scenario, you&#x2019;ll have to issue about 3,073 operations, by the way. Versus the 30 millions you would need for this approach. &#xA;So yeah, &#x201C;incremental&#x201D; map/reduce can&#x2019;t handle concurrent work, can&#x2019;t handle deletes, can&#x2019;t handle updates, and definitely shouldn&#x2019;t be used on large data sets. And that is after you went to the trouble of setting up the watcher process, monitoring the oplog, etc.&#xA;Or, you can use RavenDB and you get a true incremental map/reduce without having to worry about any of that.</p>
