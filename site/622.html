        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am apparently the first Google result for &quot;How to make a complete fool of yourself&quot;, not really flattering. The web-cast about Implementing The Event Broker got 92,835 (!) downloads, more than all the rest combined. I have a terrible memory for certain stuff, I literally can speak to a person. make a commitment, close the phone and then completely forget the conversation until about 10 hours later, at which point I really need to apologize.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been offered an opportunity to advertise Rhino Mocks in TheLounge Open Source room. What is TheLounge? It is a new&#xA0;advertising network that seems very interesting which I am going to add to the site &amp; blog. But that is not the point of this post, you can read about how it works here, if it interests you. The point of this post is that I need to supply a 120x90 image and up to 100 words for an advertisement for Rhino Mocks, and I have no idea where to start. You can see below my best 120x90 creation, and that is not something that I would really like to release into the wild :-) &#xA0;Beyond that, I can&#x27;t really think of a short message that would both describe Rhino Mocks and will not sound so marketly that I would instant gloss over it.  So, that is where you come in, I would appreciate any suggestions about the text of the ad, and if you can suggest an image as well, I would be delighted.  You can see the current OSS room ads in the Lounge home page, currently they serve SubText, BlogEngine.Net&#xA0;and BlogML (that I have noticed), and I would really like the extra exposure.

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Scott has an interesting view about my post&#xA0;regarding testing presentation logic:  However, his answer to this issue involves basically executing a dynamic page (in MonoRail) and testing the HTML output.&#xA0; He admits that this is a &quot;semi-integration test&quot;.&#xA0; I would agree with that, except for the &quot;semi&quot; part.&#xA0; If I really wanted to execute a page at the unit testing stage, I could use a tool like NUnitAsp, which operates at the same level of abstraction as&#xA0;ASP.NET server controls and thus insulates the test code somewhat from the actual rendered HTML markup. I call it semi integration test because the only part of the code that I exercise is the view code, and it is integration because I have to verify the textual result, rather than the objects themselves. Scott&#x27;s suggestion about using something like NUnitAsp is a true integration test, because it execute the entire pipeline, including the controller, data access, etc. That is not the purpose of the test, I just want to validate presentation code, not the whole thing. NUnitAsp is also not applicable because it uses WebForms, which is not something that I willingly use. Another very good point Scott is making:  Finally, forget testability for a minute and consider something I was taking for granted.&#xA0; Continuing with the banded report example, what happens when the subtotals are needed in a different view?&#xA0; Or in the output of a web service?&#xA0; If that calculation is buried inside a specific view, look at the bright side:&#xA0; At least you&#x27;ll have plenty of opportunity to practice your refactoring. If I need it in more than a single place, then it would be the time to consider refactoring. If I needed it in another view, I would probably refactor to a subview, which is a ridiculously easy to do. I doubt that I would need to do it in a web services, since that is calculable information, and would usually cause more harm than good. At any rate, I feel that pushing this to the domain level is not something that I would really want to do, it is purely presentation logic, meant for the user, without any correlation to the domain. If I had to use it in several places, I would a presentation layer class that would take care of it, but that is still presentation logic.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Seems like this is the new trend right now :-) Phil Brammer&#xA0;has posted a rebuttal to my original post. Here are my answers:  Bad Errors:You have to understand though, that this isn&#x2019;t .Net.&#xA0; SSIS has many components/engines at work that obtaining the correct error isn&#x2019;t always at the heart of the SSIS engine.&#xA0; It could be a database error.&#xA0; It could be an ADO error.&#xA0; Whatever it may be, I agree, some are cryptic, but I&#x2019;ve generally been able to diagnose my errors.&#xA0; And if there is an error I don&#x2019;t know about, I contact the community and finally Microsoft through product support.  Error handling is a key part of any platform, this should be a first level concern, that it &quot;isn&#x27;t always at the heart of the SSIS engine&quot; is a serious issue. Errors happens, and I need to know the entire chain of issues in order to figure how to fix it. To clarify how important that is to me, I am using .Net because it has exceptions, rather than HRESULT.  Random Errors:The fact these are random should banish this item from your &#x201C;SSIS 15 Faults&#x201D; list. The product sometimes gives an error, for no deterministic reason, and you consider this a non issue?  Keeping track of what it shouldn&#x2019;t:Never had this happen.&#xA0; NEVER.&#xA0; NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.&#xA0; Did I make my point?&#xA0; Yeah, your point is &quot;It works on my machine&quot;.  Sorry excuse for deployment:I don&#x2019;t understand any of the points made here.&#xA0; Deploying to a server has never been a problem.&#xA0; It is in the manual that metadata cannot change between databases/tables.&#xA0; So if you&#x2019;re moving to an environment that has its metadata different than another, you need to reconcile that first.&#xA0; I had the package fail with validation errors when moving to production when the DB schema was identical, invalid meta data errors. I don&#x27;t want to reconcile anything, the schema is identical for the tables that I am working on. And let me point out that &quot;it is in the manual&quot; carry little weight with me, I am disliking the need, not disputing its documentation.  UI Formatting instructions: Ah, well, what would you say if the SSIS dev team decided to make SSIS packages binary?&#xA0; THEN WHAT?&#xA0; At least you have an XML file that can be parsed. Uh, you do realize that for all intents and purposes, the file is binary, right? The fact that it happens to be XML based doesn&#x27;t make it human readable, source control friendly or diffable. All of the above are critical to development.  Bad interoperability:Is your Oracle example an SSIS problem, or the Oracle driver&#x2019;s problem????????? That is probably an SSIS error, but see my previous point about bad errors to know what I am not sure.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Phil Brammer&#xA0;has a posted a comment here that really annoy me, rebuting   To Adolf... &#xA0;You wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s the windows 98 of the database world.&quot; &#xA0;B.S.!! &#xA0;It&#x27;s free. &#xA0;Go buy Informatica or something. &#xA0;Jamie&#x27;s comment regarding the budget is true. &#xA0;These guys built a product right out of the gate to fulfill an ETL space in their tool belt. &#xA0;They did it, and packaged it with SQL Server. &#xA0;You buy SQL Server you get SSIS. &#xA0;Pretty neat, huh! &#xA0;So until you have to pay for it, it&#x27;s a touch absurd to say this product sucks. &#xA0;It&#x27;s pretty dang powerful (you mean I can program in .Net INSIDE my SSIS package?!?!?) for a first generation product. This annoys me because it assumes that &quot;free with SQL Server&quot; is a license to suck. SSIS isn&#x27;t free, by the way, it is part of the SQL package, which cost quite a bit. Even beyond that, it isn&#x27;t free in the most important term I can think of, it is wasting my time.  Oh, and I am decidedly unimpressed with being able to run .Net in my SSIS package, that is an ability that I can add to an existing application in an hour, so that is not any reason to get excited.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jamie Thomson&#xA0;has responded to my I Hate SSIS post, he agreed that most of them are valid concerns, but he also brought up some counter arguments that I wanted to respond to. The first thing that I wanted to mention is that JT has a solution for watching variables content, and I have updated the previous post &amp; the &quot;I Hate SSIS&quot; page accordingly. Now for the parts I disagree with:  Ayende: I wish I had a dollar for every time that SSIS kept track of something it shouldn&#x27;t. Be it the old configuration, hard coding the connection string inside the package and completely ignoring the configuration JT: I have never seen this happen in three years of using the product. If it seems as though configurations are not being used then they have been setup wrongly. That is not to say that the process of setting them up couldn&#x27;t be improved. I have it happening pretty much every day. Here is a simple story, I had canceled the package configuration, reconfigured a data source to point to the test database, and run the package. It executed itself against the production database!! Once I found that out, I managed to see it do it twice (while the data source point to the test database!), but I haven&#x27;t been able to consistently reproduce it since. I can assure the reader that I have taken the time to understand how this thing works, out of sheer necessity. It still manage to mess with me.  Ayende: Security? Who needs that JT: Is this a serious comment? Please do not try to put my words out of context, the full statement was: &quot;Security? Who needs that: I should also mention that SSIS packages requires sysadmin rights to run when scheduled as a job. Which of course it will not tell you until you have run the job. I am aware of the agent proxy solution&quot;  Ayende: I should also mention that SSIS packages requires sysadmin rights to run when scheduled as a job JT: This is completely untrue. It is possible to setup proxy accounts that are not sysadmin in order to run packages. Again, please do not quote out of context, as you can see above, the very next statement acknowledged the existence of proxy solutions, I still want to understand why this exists. To my comments about the bad configuration scheme and their unpredictability:  JT: Back to my point above, if this is happening then the configurations have been setup wrongly. It NEVER chooses configurations at random.&#xA0;It would be good if the person making the point could make some suggestion as to how it could be improved because if people are experiencing this then there needs to be improvement somewhere. And what&#x27;s the issue with environment variables? The issue with environment variables is this is actually something that I would never consider for configuration. Putting a connection string in an environment variables is strange. JT, let us start with a concept that doesn&#x27;t hard code configuration information to the package. I want to point to a configuration file that is in the same directory as the package, it doesn&#x27;t let me handle it. I want to choose one of three databases for configuration, depending when I want to do that, etc. As for their unpredictability, it may have a system for that, but as I pointed above, even with the configuration OFF it will still do things that I don&#x27;t want. On UPSERT support:  JT: Hmm...not sure about this one. UPSERT is an operation that would have to be supported by the database platform being inserted/updated wouldn&#x27;t it? Not sure why this is SSIS&#x27;s fault. Perhaps I&#x27;m misunderstanding in which case I&#x27;m happy to be put straight. It quite trivial to allow update / insert based on a given set of key fields, and it is certainly something that I would expect to see in an ETL product. Given the common need for this. Even something that was DB specific would be welcomed. SSIS speed, lack there of:  JT: There is room for improvement here in the bloated VS shell&#xA0;but mainly its important to understand WHY this is happening. When a package opens up it tries to validate all external connections. If this is taking a long time then the blame is on the external connections and the network in between, not on SSIS. It is possible to turn off this validation by selecting &#x27;Work Offline&#x27; from the SSIS menu. Um, there is something that is called a background thread, and it is used to do work without freezing&#xA0;the UI. I don&#x27;t care about the time that it takes to validate things, I want to get things done, let the tool sort those out without interrupting me. Working offline is not a valid option, because then you get a whole lot of validation errors, just for the fun of it. And last:   SSIS can easily be used in a multi-developer environemnt. I know this because I&#x27;m currently working in one. Good, how do you handle two developers working on the same package? How do you handle branching and merging?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The CLR team deserve a truly great appreciation for making&#xA0;generics works at all. When you get down to it, it is amazingly complex. Most of the Rhino Mocks bugs stems from having to work at that level. Here is one example, &#xA0;comparing method equality. Let us take this simple example: [TestFixture]&#xA;public class WeirdStuff&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public class Test&lt;T&gt;&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;public void Compare()&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Assert.AreEqual(GetType().GetMethod(&quot;Compare&quot;),&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;MethodInfo.GetCurrentMethod()&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;[Test]&#xA;&#x9;public void ThisIsWeird()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;new Test&lt;int&gt;().Compare();&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;This is one of those things that can really bites you. And it fails only if the type is a generic type, even though the comparison is made of the closed generic version of the type.&#xA0;Finding the root cause was fairly hard,&#xA0;and naturally&#xA0;the whole thing is internal, but&#xA0;eventually I managed to come up with a way to compare them safely:&#xA;private static bool AreMethodEquals(MethodInfo left, MethodInfo right)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;if (left.Equals(right))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return true;&#xA;&#x9;// GetHashCode calls to RuntimeMethodHandle.StripMethodInstantiation()&#xA;&#x9;// which is needed to fix issues with method equality from generic types.&#xA;&#x9;if (left.GetHashCode() != right.GetHashCode())&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return false;&#xA;&#x9;if (left.DeclaringType != right.DeclaringType)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return false;&#xA;&#x9;ParameterInfo[] leftParams = left.GetParameters();&#xA;&#x9;ParameterInfo[] rightParams = right.GetParameters();&#xA;&#x9;if (leftParams.Length != rightParams.Length)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return false;&#xA;&#x9;for (int i = 0; i &lt; leftParams.Length; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;if (leftParams[i].ParameterType != rightParams[i].ParameterType)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return false;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;if (left.ReturnType != right.ReturnType)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return false;&#xA;&#x9;return true;&#xA;}&#xA;The secret here is with the call to GetHashCode, which remove the method instantiation code, which is fairly strange concept, because I wasn&#x27;t aware that you can instantiate methods :-)</p>
