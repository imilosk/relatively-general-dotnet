            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just did a major refactoring to Rhino DSL, to add orthongality to the DslEngine. It was an interesting refactoring, and something that is worth talking about. Let us take a look at the before image, first:   We have two classes that are involved in creating and managing DSL. Notice the FileFormat, CreateInput, GetMatchingUrlsIn and NotifyOnChange methods on the DslEngine? Or the GetFromCache, RemoveFromCache, SetInCache methods? The firsts are related to the storage of the DSL scripts on disk and the second batch are related to caching, they have nothing to do with the actual work performed by the DslEngine. Those are completely different responsibilities and concerns. I didn&#x27;t feel the pain of mixing the responsibilities until I had to create a class that wanted to change the storage mechanism of the scripts.&#xA0; Looking at it, the cache methods especially really want to move to another class. You can tell by their names. Then I realized that I had to override a bunch of methods and correlate results between them, and I found myself thinking, &quot;Who the hell wrote this nightmare?&quot; *. Changing the storage mechanism, something that I certainly wanted to support, has gotten fairly involved, and I couldn&#x27;t see anyone figuring out all the knobs they had to turn without reading the source, carefully. This is a bad situation to be in. Hence, refactoring. What was involved in this was mostly moving code around. The technicalities of it where mostly these:  Ask R# to extract super class with the unrelated methods. Ask R# to extract an interface from the new super class Remove the inheritance association with the DslEngine Add a property for the new interface type Initialize the property to use a default implementation Fix code that broke as a result (mostly involved adding the property name before the method). Rename methods to match current location (Removing the &quot;Cache&quot; from the methods in the caching interface). The result is this:  Now, changing the storage mechanism doesn&#x27;t need to affect the DSL implementation. We have a more robust model, and a good example for the blog. Of course, I just finished writing half a chapter about the old way of doing things... Time for a rewrite.  * I often think thoughts like this, the sad answer is often: &quot;Me&quot;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, I am impressed. Really impressed. I installed a non-web-edition of Win 2008, and now everything works as it should.  I really like what Microsoft did here. Both in terms of the UI experience that you get, the guidance that they keep popping up (which is not annoying), the speed, and overall feeling. What really made me happy was this. Now I can actually drill down and see what is going on so easily.   Something that certainly cheered me up was the file-copy test:   It started instantly, and it looks like we get information that is actually useful. Unlike... that other OS.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Looks like my MacBook Pro laptop will take some time to arrive :-(&#xA;The good news is that I got it with ~350$ discount. I ordered a 2.6Ghz model, but the store had it for the price of 2.4Ghz. They will respect the order, but apparently this means that I have to wait 2 - 3 weeks to get it.&#xA;Next week I am going to start traveling, and the prospect of of doing so without a laptop is creeping me out. I scrounged a laptop for the travel, but it is probably not a development one. Should be interesting.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just installed Windows 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 on a VM. Here is the result:   I am not sure what is in there, but it is a lot. I then tried to install SQL Server 2005, but is never let me actually install the server, it only want to install the client components. It warns that you need SP2, so I installed that, then try it again, no go. Any ideas?   By the way, so far, ignoring the issue of the SQL Server installation issues, I am impressed by Win 2008, it looks slick, it is fast even on a slow VM. And it is not annoying me. Update: I think that I am stupid. Looks like I installed the web edition of 2008, which I guess can&#x27;t handle SQL Server. I&#x27;m downloading the standard version now, will see how it works.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Let us assume that we need to load some code, potentially un-trusted / hostile into our application. The runtime has a lot of functionality to offer us in this regard, we can segregate the strange code pretty well in a low privilege AppDomain, but we can&#x27;t protect ourselves from the AddIn killing us. There are two simple ways an AddIn can kill the host application, without the host being able to do something about it. Both are very easy to do by mistake, unfortunately. The first is to simply throw an unhandled exception from a thread and the second is to cause a stack overflow. Both are considered as fatal errors and can not be recovered. In fact, in the stack overflow case, you can&#x27;t ever get any information about what exactly happened. Here is a simple malicious addin that cannot be recovered or traced: public class MaliicousAddin : MarshalByRefObject&#xA;{&#xA;    public void Execute()&#xA;    {&#xA;        new Thread(delegate(object obj)&#xA;        {&#xA;            Overflow();&#xA;        }).Start();&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    private void Overflow()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Overflow();&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;This puts us in somewhat of a problem. We want to have a way to recover from malicious (or badly written) add ins. There are two ways that I have found to do so, both are unsatisfactory. The first is to simply run the AddIns in another process, which means that the add in can still crash the process, but the host is actually running on another process, and so not affected. The second is to play with the CRL Hosting API in order to modify the default runtime behavior. This option is probably out if you plan on hosting your application somewhere (like IIS, for example).&#xA;Any other options?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Recently there have been a long discussion in the ALT.Net mailing list about Auto Mocking Containers. We covered a lot of ground there and it is interesting to boot.  What I wanted to talk about comes from this discussion. A while ago there was a big stick about Persistence Ignorance. I won&#x27;t reiterate the arguments, but I want to expand the idea to other concepts as well. It is not just persistence that your code should be ignorant of, it is all the infrastructure concerns in general. I don&#x27;t care how good your infrastructure code is, it is still nasty pitfall of technicalities. I know that all of mine have been this way. The IoC container that you use shouldn&#x27;t appear anywhere in your code, nor should the persistence concerns mix themselves with the actual code. Invasive approaches, no matter what they do, should be frowned on. A lot of people thinks that the model below is a good one to follow:  Personally, I think that it putting too much emphasis on the infrastructure. The infrastructure should not sit at the heart of the application. It should be shoved to some misbegotten corner and only see the light of day if there is no other choice.  The diagram below demonstrate how I think it should be.    There should be a lot more weight for the actual application code than the infrastructure code, and only at well defined locations will you have domain services call down to the infrastructure. In fact, I would like to isolate that as much as possible. Dependency Injection, AOP and minor amount of wrapping should allow you to get an application that is infrastructure ignorance.  The immediate result of which is that you get a lot more focus on actual business value than on implemented two phase commit using FAT12 file system.  That is not to say that infrastructure is not important, it is critically important. But the infrastructure should not be invasive.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just and took a look at the recent Dot Net Rocks show, as a way to look at &quot;what the market is thinking about&quot;. I got some interesting responses from looking at the titles. I haven&#x27;t listen to all of them (not by far), but I won&#x27;t let that stop me from commenting.  Adam Nathan on Popfly and SilverlightNot interested at all. Something that belongs to another planet as far as I am concerned. Combining Popfly (some sort of purple duck, I understand) and Silverlight puts it on the far reaches of Saturn, as far as I am concerned. Miguel de Icaza and Geoff Norton on MonoDefiantly interesting, I have been keeping an eye on Mono for a while, I am waiting to see how it works on the Mac, and I argued for Mono based deployment in several projects in the past. EC2 &#x2B; Mono seems like a very interesting option. Andy Leonard on Unit Testing your DatabaseSeems interesting, but mostly my answer to that is: Use in-memory database for that. Oh, and don&#x27;t use SSIS. Rhino ETL is trivially testable, by the way. Kirk Munro on Powershell and PowerGUINot interested in PowerShell beyond the most cursory of glances. If I want scripting, I got Boo.  Simon Peyton Jones on Haskell and Functional ProgrammingThis is something that I have yet to listen, but it is interesting, mostly because it is a totally different mind-set than the one I usually use. Les Pinter Looks BackThat was a fun show, not technical content, but really good to listen to it. Aaron Skonnard puts BizTalk and WCF TogetherI get the shivers just thinking about the subject, next. Sahil Malik Shares the PointAnd I&#x27;ll keep on going missing the point.  David Aiken on Bridging the Gap between Dev and ITThis looks like an interesting show.  Steven Lees on FeedSyncNot interested, I even took a look at the description to ensure that I am not interested. Kathleen Dollard on the Evolution of Software DevelopmentThat was a fun show. Ken Levy on Visual Studio Extensibility (VSX)I need to be interested in that, because I have a chapter about IDEs that I need to write, but... that is not an interesting topic to me. Go write in notepad. Jeff Prosise Goes Deep on SilverlightDid I mention that it is not interesting? Joe Duffy on the Task Parallel LibraryThat was a good show, and something that I actively looking at. Richard Campbell Tells All!Very good show. Jeff Palermo on ASP.NET MVCIt was a good show, but the topic is not interesting, as far as I am concerned. Gael Fraiteur on PostSharpPostSharp is something that I keep looking at, haven&#x27;t found the need for it, but it is an interesting project, and surprisingly outside my usual circles. Tomas Petricek on PHP in ASP.NET and Silverlight! Yawn, yawn.  Open Source Panel Discussion at DevTeach, VancouverI refer to this episode as the &quot;if loop&quot; show. Naveen Yajaman on Visual Studio Tools for ApplicationsThrough this show, I kept thinking: Or they could use Boo, get everything that they want and not have to pay &quot;undisclosed&quot; amount in licensing. Colin Miller and the .NET Micro Framework!Interesting in the abstract, not sure of its utility. F# Moves ForwardI have this low level urge to look at F#, but I am just not interested enough. Dot Net Nuke Discussion PanelNot interested. Kent Alstad at Dev Connections!This should be a scalability show, which are generally interesting, except that I am sick of hearing about &quot;don&#x27;t use view state&quot;, or the fallacy of &quot;scalability means that you can&#x27;t use convient idioms&quot; Tim Sneath and Ian Ellison-Taylor on Windows Past, Present and FutureThat should be interesting.  Pablo Castro on AstoriaIf I recall correctly, Anders Nor&#xE5;s wrote an equivalent for that in a few hours. Not really interested. I think that I&#x27;ll leave interpretation of those for the comments, but it looks to me like technology topics are growing very old, very fast.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Yesterday I left We!, today I handled the last remains, and now I am free. Interesting feeling, and I do miss the car so very much... This also puts me in the interesting position of being laptop-less. This is less comfortable than I thought it would be. I have a week or two before I can get my new laptop. Following quite a few recommendations, I got a MacBook Pro 17&quot;. I&#x27;ll report about it when I get it. Current task, and the reason that I don&#x27;t have much time, writing the book. It turns out to be much harder than expected. I can get 5 pages in an hour or two at one seating, or I can get two sentences in the same time period in the next (the reason that I am blogging now instead of slaving away at the manuscript). Oh, and I changed the blog, can you spot what is different?</p>
