            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, apparently is is customary for bloggers that do not have anything to post to put some pictures of their cat. I don&#x27;t have a cat, but I have a this shy little dog that I adore, her name is Rose.   Of course, that doesn&#x27;t really give you any sense of scale, so here is her standing up, I am a big guy, her nose topped six feet by a fair margin. (about 1.85 for the civilized among us).   And, of course, the other side, here is her after I let her know that I am going away for a few weeks. I hope the bruises will heal soon, but for now, I need to move a bit carefully.   And no, it is not going to become a theme in this blog. But I found myself explaining to people on the phone all too often why they suddenly hear cries of &quot;No, you are not supposed to eat cats!&quot; and &quot;Damn it already, I am not edible, get that through your head&quot; or just &quot;Argh!&quot;. I hope this clarify things a bit.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Phil Haack is talking about why the MS MVC team changed IHttpContext to HttpContextBase. I follow the argument, but at some point, I just lost it. This, in particular, had me scratching my head in confusion:  Adding this method doesn&#x2019;t break older clients. Newer clients who might need to call this method can recompile and now call this new method if they wish. This is where we get the versioning benefits. How on earth does adding a new method to an interface would break an existing client? How on earth does adding a new method to an interface require a compilation from client code. Now, to be clear, when I am talking about changing the interface I am talking solely about adding new methods (or overloads), not about changing a method signature or removing a method. Those are hard breaking changes no matter what approach you take. By adding a method to an interface? That is mostly harmless. The only thing that require that is if you are implementing this interface, not if you are using it. It is possible that Phil is using the term clients in a far wider meaning than I would put on this, but this is not the general use of the term as I see it. Prefer abstract classes to interfaces, use internals and no virtual by defaults are three of the main issues that I have with the framework design guidelines. I have major issues with them because they are actively harming the users of the framework. Sure, it might make my work as a framework developer harder, but guess what, that is my job as a framework developer, to give the best experience that I can to my users. [Framework Design Guidelines rant over] Now, I do believe that I have some little experience in shipping large frameworks and versioning them through multiply releases and through a long period of time. I also believe that some of those frameworks are significantly larger and more complex than what the MS MVC is going to be. (Hint, if MS MVC even seems, by an illiterate drunken sailor on a rainy day, to approach NHibernate&#x27;s complexity, it is time to hit the drawing board again). And those frameworks are using frameworks to do pretty much everything. And I cannot recall off hand any breaking change that resulted from that. In some cases, where the interface is an extension point into the framework, we have gone with interface &#x2B; base class with default functionality. If you use the base class, you are guaranteed no breaking change. The reasoning for an interface is that it is giving the user more choice, you aren&#x27;t limiting the options that the user have when it comes to use this (by taking out the single inheritance slot, for example). Now, if we analyze the expected usage of IHttpContext for a moment, who is going to be affected by changing this interface? Only implementers. Who is going to implement IHttpHandler? I can think of only two scenarios. Hand rolled test fakes and extending the Http Context in some interesting ways, perhaps by adding proxies or decorators to it. In the first case, that is no something that I would worry about. The second is far rarer but also the much more interesting case, but those are generally not done by hand (I wouldn&#x27;t want to type all the methods of IHttpContext, that is for sure). Even if it was, I still have no issue with it. New framework version, add a method. It is not a significant change. A significant change would require me to rework large swathes of my application. Now, why do I care for that? The reason is very simple. It is a pain to me, personally, when I end up running into those warts. It is annoying, frustrating and aggravating. I like to be happy, because otherwise I am not happy, so I try to minimize my exposure to the afore mentioned warts. Hopefully, I can make them go away entirely. And not just by pulling the blanket over my head.</p>

Now that I pushed all the current changes out, we need to start thinking about the next version. I am planning on seeing what kind of syntax I can get from the language using C# 3.0. As of yet, I don&#x27;t have any concrete ideas about what should be done, so I am here to solicit ideas about what you want. Syntax suggestions, patches, comments, etc are all welcome.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, it is about that time again, I got enough changes to make a release worthwhile. It has been almost five months, and we got a whole bunch of stuff going on, including a lot of stuff from contributors. (Take that, one man project :-) ). As usual, you can get it here and the source is available here. It is interesting to note that a lot of people have stuck with Rhino Mocks 3.1, I guess that there is really no need to upgrade, if you get what you want... Features, more features, glorious features!  Added CreateMockWithRemoting and DynamicMockWithRemoting to work around BCL bug when overriding a generic method with generic constraint.This is useful when you want to force Rhino Mocks to use Remoting proxies (usually it just guess and you don&#x27;t deal with this). That is needed because at certain cases ( generic methods with generic constraints ) there is a bug in Reflection Emit that generate invalid code. Mike Nichols&#xA0; has added List.ContainsAll() constraint Shawn Neal added the DoNotExpect syntax, which is clearer the Expect.Call().Repeat.Never(), it is certainly shorter. Added trace writer with stack trace, should make it easier to track down strange mocking behavior. Now you can just enable logging and see all the method calls that are being made. Guido van Loon supplied the Property.AllPropertiesMatch constraints Making sure that recorders that wrap recorders will be merged if they contain only one element. Again, this is something that you are not supposed to understand unless you went deep into the code. Suffice to say that the behavior is easier to understand now. Bugs, annoying bugs, stupid bugs!  Fixing issue with empty recorders nested in recorders that has expectations. If you don&#x27;t get that, then rest assure, neither do I. Demid Sukhovsky&#xA0; fixed Rhino Mocks support for Out/Ref values using remoting proxies. Fixing null reference exception when stubbing a class with protected setter. Aaron Jensen fixed the validation message when you expect a method that accept a mock object as a parameter. Aaron Jensen also fixed a bunch of my typos. Steven Rockarts fixed a bunch more of my typos. Fixed an issue with methods returning non primitive value types, such as UInt32</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, this is a big moment. My book is now available for as part of the Manning Early Access Program. Chapter 1 to 4 are already there, but they are there in their nearly raw format. That means that they have not been edited yet, and I didn&#x27;t put in the results from the review cycle that we did yet. The book forum is here, I eagerly awaits the posts telling me how off base I am :-) More seriously, I would appreciate any feedback that you have on the book, the topic, the code, etc. Thanks, &#xA0; ~Ayende</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am working on ICriterion and IProjection at the moment, making each understand each other. It is working very well, and I really like the ability to just go in and make a drastic change. The problem is the scope of the change. I have had to touch pretty much all of the NHibernate.Expression in the last two days. Just to give you an idea, here is the most recent comment. Damn I am glad that I have tests there.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So for the last few hours I have been getting back into the Linq for NHibernate project, after having left it for far too long. I am beginning to think that building a Linq provider might not have been the best way to learn C# 3.0, but never mind that now. It is with great pride that I can tell you that the following query now works: from e in db.Employeesselect new { Name = e.FirstName &#x2B; &quot; &quot; &#x2B; e.LastName, Phone = e.HomePhone } Why is this trivial query important? Well, it is important because about a year ago I said that there is only a single feature in Linq for SQL that NHibernate doesn&#x27;t have. I also promised to fix it the moment that someone would tell me what it is. No one did, so it waited until today. The main issue had to do with the Criteria API and handling parameters, no one ever needed to do that, it seems. When they did, they generally used HQL, which did have this feature. Since I have based Linq for NHibernate on the Criteria API*, that was a problem. Now that ReSharper works on C# 3.0, I can actually get things done there, so I sat down and implemented it. It is surprisingly difficult issue, but I threw enough code on it until it gave up (I wonder if there is a name for nested visitors... ). At any rate, I strongly recommend that you&#x27;ll take a look at the project. And bug (fixes) and other patches are welcome**. * This decision was important for two reasons, the first was that it is generally easier to use the Criteria API programmatically, and the second was that I wanted to ensure that the Crtieria API (which I favor) was a full featured as the HQL route. ** Yes, I know that I&#x27;ll regret it.</p>
