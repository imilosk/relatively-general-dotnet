            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have a piece of code that does something on types. It is a whole complex thing that does a lot of stuff. And the code is really ugly, here is a small part from ~180 lines method.   The problem would have been much simpler if we could only switch on types, which is effectively what I want to do here. As it stands, however, the JIT is actually going to replace all those if statements with pointer comparisons to the method table, so this is pretty fast. Unpleasant to read, but really fast. I decided to see what it would take to create a more readable version:  public class TypeCounter&#xA;{&#xA;    public int Long;&#xA;&#xA;    public Dictionary&lt;Type, Action&lt;object&gt;&gt; Actions;&#xA;&#xA;    public TypeCounter()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Actions = new Dictionary&lt;Type, Action&lt;object&gt;&gt;&#xA;        {&#xA;            [typeof(long)] = o =&gt; Long&#x2B;&#x2B;,&#xA;            [typeof(int)] = o =&gt; Long&#x2B;&#x2B;,&#xA;        };&#xA;    }&#xA;    public void Dic(object instance)&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (instance == null)&#xA;            return;&#xA;        Action&lt;object&gt; value;&#xA;        if (Actions.TryGetValue(instance.GetType(), out value))&#xA;            value(instance);&#xA;&#xA;    }&#xA;    public void Explicit(object instance)&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (instance is int)&#xA;            Long&#x2B;&#x2B;;&#xA;        else if (instance is long)&#xA;            Long&#x2B;&#x2B;;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;This is just a simpler case of the code above, focused on just the two options. The dictionary version is much more readable, especially once you get to more than a couple of types. The problem, I have tested this on both this two types option as well as 10 types, and in all cases, the explicit version is about twice as fast. &#xA;So this rules it out, and we are left with the sad looking code that can run.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">You might have noticed the low level work I have been posting about lately. This is part of a larger effort to better control over our environment, and hopefully gain more than mere incremental performance improvement.&#xA;As part of that, we decided to restructure a lot of our core dependencies. The data format change is one such example, but there are others. Of particular relevance to this post is the webserver and web stack that we use, as well as the actual programming model.&#xA;In order to reduce, as much as possible, dependencies on everything else, I decided that I want to benchmark a truly complex part of RavenDB, the &#x201C;/build/version&#x201D; endpoint. As you can imagine, this endpoint simply reports the RavenDB version.&#xA;Here is how it looks like in RavenDB 3.0:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is WebAPI controller, running on OWIN using HttpListener. The methods calls you see here are static (cached) properties, which generate an anonymous object that gets serialized to JSON.&#xA;In order to test this, I decided to use gobench to see what kind of functionality I show expect. I run the following command:&#xA;&#xA;.\gobench.exe -c 100 -r 5000 -u http://localhost:8080/build/version&#xA;&#xA;Here is what this looked like when I run this:&#xA;&#xA;The CPU usage was roughly 70% &#x2013; 80% by RavenDB, and the rest was taken by gobench. Here are the results:&#xA;&#xA;Requests:                          500,000 hits&#xA;Successful requests:               500,000 hits&#xA;Network failed:                          0 hits&#xA;Bad requests failed (!2xx):              0 hits&#xA;Successful requests rate:           15,151 hits/sec&#xA;Read throughput:                 4,030,304 bytes/sec&#xA;Write throughput:                1,500,000 bytes/sec&#xA;Test time:                              33 sec&#xA;&#xA;Remember, we don&#x2019;t do any real work here, no I/O, no computation, nothing much at all.&#xA;Nevertheless, this is quite a nice number, even if it is effectively a hello world. This is with a 100 clients doing 5,000 requests each. Admittedly, this in on the local machine (we&#x2019;ll do remote testing later), but quite nice.&#xA;How about our new code? How does it compare?&#xA;&#xA;Requests:                          500,000 hits&#xA;Successful requests:               500,000 hits&#xA;Network failed:                          0 hits&#xA;Bad requests failed (!2xx):              0 hits&#xA;Successful requests rate:           12,500 hits/sec&#xA;Read throughput:                 2,312,500 bytes/sec&#xA;Write throughput:                1,237,500 bytes/sec&#xA;Test time:                              40 sec&#xA;&#xA;So we are a bit slower, although not by much. That is nice, to start with. And here are the process stats while this is running.&#xA;&#xA;You might think that I&#x2019;m disappointed, but quite the reverse is true. You see, this benchmark results that you are seeing.&#xA;They were taken while running under a profiler.&#xA;In other words, we saddled ourselves with a huge performance hit, and we are still within touching distance.&#xA;You might have noticed that the process shown here is dnx.exe. This is us running on CoreCLR with the Kesterl web server, and without any web framwork (such as WebAPI). The code we are running here is here:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, there is quite a bit more code here than in the previous code snippet. This is mostly because we are still playing with the API. We&#x2019;ll probably have something like the GetObject method once we decide exactly on how to do it. For now, we want to have everything in our face, because it simplify how we are doing things.&#xA;Anyway, I mentioned that I was running this under a profiler, right? Actually, I run this under a profiler while I run the previous command 3 times. Here are the relevant results:&#xA;&#xA;I highlighted a couple of interesting results. The call to BuildVersion.Get took 0.2ms (while under the profiler) and most of the time was spent in serializing the result into JSON (in the profiler output, ReadObjectInternal and Write/WriteTo methods).&#xA;Another interesting to note is the TryMatch call. this is how we handle routing. I&#x2019;ll have a seaprate post on that, but for now, those are pretty encouraging results.&#xA;One thing that I do have to say is that the new code is not doing a lot of things that the existing codebase is doing. For example, we keep track on a lot of stuff (requests, durations, etc) that can affect request timing. So it isn&#x2019;t fair to just compare the numbers. Let us inspect how our existing codebase handle the load under the same profiling scenario.&#xA;This time I run it only once, so we have only 500,000 requests to look at:&#xA;&#xA;The most obvious think to see here is the request duration. A request takes roughly 6ms under the profiler. While it takes 0.2ms in the new code (still under profiler). The routing code is expensive, but I&#x2019;ll talk about this in another post. And you can see some of the other stuff that we do that the new code doesn&#x2019;t (autorization, etc).&#xA;Oh, and here are the actual results:&#xA;&#xA;Requests:                          500,000 hits&#xA;Successful requests:               500,000 hits&#xA;Network failed:                          0 hits&#xA;Bad requests failed (!2xx):              0 hits&#xA;Successful requests rate:            1,577 hits/sec&#xA;Read throughput:                   419,563 bytes/sec&#xA;Write throughput:                  156,151 bytes/sec&#xA;Test time:                             317 sec&#xA;&#xA;That is quite a change.&#xA;Oh, and what about running the new code without a profiler? I have done so, and here is what we see:&#xA;&#xA;And the actual numbers are:&#xA;&#xA;Requests:                        1,500,000 hits&#xA;Successful requests:             1,500,000 hits&#xA;Network failed:                          0 hits&#xA;Bad requests failed (!2xx):              0 hits&#xA;Successful requests rate:           75,000 hits/sec&#xA;Read throughput:                13,875,000 bytes/sec&#xA;Write throughput:                7,425,000 bytes/sec&#xA;Test time:                              20 sec&#xA;&#xA;So we actually have capactity to spare here. I&#x2019;m pretty happy with the results for now.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As you read this post, you might want to also consider letting this play in the background. We had a UDP port leak in RavenDB. We squashed it like a bug, but somehow it kep repeating.  &#xA0; We found one cause of it (and fixed it), finally. That was after several rounds of looking at the code and fixing a few &#x201C;this error condition can lead to the socket not being properly disposed&#x201D;. Finally, we pushed to our own internal systems, and monitored things, and saw that it was good. But the bloody bug kept repeating. Now, instead of manifesting as thousands of UDP ports, we had just a dozen or so, but they were (very) slowly increasing. And it drove us nuts. We had logging there, and we could see that we didn&#x2019;t had the kind of problems that we had before. And everything looked good.  A full reproduction of the issue can be here, but the relevant piece of code is here: Timer timer = new Timer(async state =&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    try&#xA;    {&#xA;        var addresses = await Dns.GetHostAddressesAsync(&quot;time.nasa.gov&quot;);&#xA;        var endPoint = new IPEndPoint(addresses[0], 123);&#xA;&#xA;        using (var udpClient = new UdpClient())&#xA;        {&#xA;            udpClient.Connect(endPoint);&#xA;            udpClient.Client.ReceiveTimeout = 100;&#xA;            udpClient.Client.SendTimeout = 100;&#xA;            await udpClient.SendAsync(new byte[] {12, 32, 43}, 3);&#xA;            await udpClient.ReceiveAsync();&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;    catch (Exception e)&#xA;    {&#xA;        Console.WriteLine(e);&#xA;        Environment.Exit(-1);&#xA;    }&#xA;});&#xA;timer.Change(500, 500);&#xA;As you can see, we are issuing a request to a time server, wrap the usage of the UDP socket in a using statement, make sure to have proper error handling, setup the proper timeouts, the works.&#xA;Our read code is actually awash with logging, detailed error handling, and we poured over that a crazy amount of time to figure out what was going on.&#xA;If you run this code, and watch the number of used TCP ports, you&#x2019;ll see a very curious issue. It is always increasing. What is worse, there are no errors, nothing. It just goes into a black hole in the sky and doesn&#x2019;t work.&#xA;In this case, I&#x2019;ve explicitly created a malformed request, so it is expected that the remote server will not reply to me. That allows us to generate the proper scenario. In production, of course, we send the right value, and we typically get the right result, so we didn&#x2019;t see this.&#xA;The error we had was the timeout values. The documentation quite clearly states that they apply to the syncronous method only, and since they don&#x2019;t say a word about the async method, this does not apply to the async methods. Given how UDP works, that makes perfect sense. To support timeout on the async methods, the UdpClient would need to start a timer to do so.&#xA0; However, given the API, it is very easy to see how we kept missing this.&#xA;The real issue is that when we make a request to a server, and for whatever reason, the UDP reply packet is dropped, we just hang in an async manner. That is, we have an async call that will never return. That call holds the UDP port open, and over time, that shows up as a leak. That is pretty horrible, but the good thing is that once we knew what the problem was, fixing it was trivial.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Kelly Sommers had this twit, that caught my attention.   While half a minute pause is not something that we have really seen, we have seen production systems that spend a lot of their cycles on GC. That is better than a pause, but only in the same way that you prefer to stab your toe rather than break your leg. As per the title of this post, the most challenging tasks in a database engine isn&#x2019;t actually how to fetch the data, or how it is stored, but the management of the various resources that are available. In particular, CPU utilization, memory usage and I/O. Most databases handle I/O pretty much from the get go, because it is such a painful topic. And it is relatively easy and obvious to see how you need to handle CPU allocations. But memory is tricky. It is tricky because you typically want to share as much of it as possible, to reduce memory usage, except you don&#x2019;t, because of thread safety and &#x201C;is someone still using that?&#x201D; issues. The GC is a really great invention in this regard, because you can offload all of this behavior (well, not the thread safety one, but deciding when to throw stuff out can also be hard) to a well tested component and pretty much forget about it. That would be a mistake. See Kelly&#x2019;s post above for the reasons why. By not managing memory yourself, you are letting a standard component, which you have no control over, take over a critical part of your system. With potentially dramatic results.  But we need to distinguish between different types of memory here. Modern GCs are typically using some notion of generations (Gen0, Gen1, Gen2) and are really good in collecting memory that isn&#x2019;t held for long. The major problem is when you have memory that is retained for a long period of time (thus pushed to Gen1, Gen2), which caused the problems. The good thing about a managed language and the GC is that you can write trivially simple code, and it would typically run at a faster speed than a similarly trivially simple native code. A good experiment on that is Raymond Chen&#x2019;s dictionary series, notice Rico&#x2019;s analysis there. The solution is to take active control on that, and make clear distinctions between the different types of memory. Being able to have cheap allocations&#xA0; for short term objects (such as handling of a request) is a great productivity boost, but the database needs to know that anything that is either large or potentially long living cannot really be treated as standard managed objects. The database needs to allocate them by itself, preferably in the native heap, and manage that directly. Once you do that, the actual managed memory you&#x2019;ll use is almost all in the context of handling requests / other short term operations, and any GC collections will only impact that request (typically at the end of it).  Most managed databases are headed in that direction, and for a good reason.  As for RavenDB, see the previous posts I had recently.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most important things that you need to do for high performance is to control your allocations. Indeed, the blittable format is almost entirely implemented in unmanaged memory. And we get a great deal of performance from not having the GC poke its annoying little nose into our data structures. That said, it means that we take the onus of managing the memory ourselves.&#xA;This post is about a couple of changes that we made to the memory management system in the blittable format, and some future directions we intend to explore.&#xA;The first thing that we did was to implement an unmanaged memory pool based on ConcurrentDictionary&lt;int, ConcurrentStack&lt;IntPtr&gt;&gt;. The int is the size (in power of two) of the allocated blocks. And we would allocate from the heap, and then store the buffers internally for reuse. That worked, but profiling showed that we had quite a bit of work in just leasing and returning the buffers to the thread safe pool.&#xA;Note that this was when we only tested using a single thread, we expect that the cost of working with it would only increase when using multiple threads.&#xA;That sucked.&#xA;Luckily, we use the context pattern for pretty much everything in blittable format (and more generally in RavenDB), so we can take advantage of that. We have a three stages process.&#xA;First, we allocate the memory when we first request it. Then, when we are done using it, we return it to the context, not the global pool. This allows us to avoid cross thread coordination costs entirely. And it is quite common for threads to need to run the same buffers multiple times, so we save the &#x201C;check in the buffer&#x201D; just to &#x201C;lease me this buffer again, please&#x201D; style of work.&#xA;Here are the costs when using a single shared, thread safe pool:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, we spent quite a bit of time just managing the thread safe collections. You don&#x2019;t see it in this profile, but other profiling sessions show the concurrent dictionary under load as well. And this is in a single threaded, no contention benchmark.&#xA;We moved the memory allocations to the context. Because a context is single treaded, we can rely on much simpler (and cheaper) collections, and we can also reuse contexts. A request checks out a context, which has its own cached buffers. It runs through the request, then return the context as a whole to the buffer. Each of those contexts can then manage their own memory and only rarely need to go to the global pool. There is some complexity about making sure that overly fat contexts hang around, but that is basically it.&#xA;And when we need to release the data from the context, we can do all of that in a single bulk operation. Here are the profiler results after:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I admit, it is a bit disappointing to see only a 100% improvement, but I can comfort myself with knowing that the saving in multi threaded scenarios are much higher.&#xA;I mentioned that we also have some ideas on improving this furhter. This idea (which we deferred right now because there are other more important things to do) include just allocating a big buffer (128MB in size) per context. We&#x27;ll not commit all of it, merely reserve the address space, and start allocating from it directly. Basically, each allocation would simply be a pointer increment (with occational calls to commit the rest of the reserved address space).&#xA;Now, in order to free the memory, all we need would be to reset the position to zero, and we are set to reuse the context again at effectively zero cost. If this sounds familiar to you, this is because this is primarily how allocations actually work in .NET, except that we explicitly control the size and the lifetime of all the objects in there.&#xA;It also has no cost in GC, which is quite nice. As I said, we are thinking about this, but at this point, I think that we are fast enough that we don&#x27;t need to go there yet. We&#x27;ll have to see under concurrent usage what this will be.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This series of posts is continuting the work I have outlined in this series. While in the previous series, I focused on the overall picture, here I want to talk about the small things we did to speedup pretty much every aspect of the system. In some cases, those are order of magnitude differences.&#xA;In this post, I want to talk about the following:&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;Oren\r\nEini&#x201D;&#xA;&#xA;Such a simple thing,&#xA0;if you just look at the surface, and yet if you&#x2019;ll profile the Json.NET code, you&#x2019;ll see an interesting issue. I took an existing JSON file (about 67MB in size) and continiously wrote it to /dev/null under a profiler. The results are actually quite surprising.&#xA;&#xA;In fact, this is a bit worse.&#xA;&#xA;dotTrace has a great feature that allows you to remove &#x201C;noise&#x201D; from a trace. Here is what happens if we eliminate this call:&#xA;&#xA;So, pretty obivously, this is an really expensive call. But how expensive is it, really? Note that this profiling run used a Null Stream, so there isn&#x2019;t any I/O cost to consider. This is the pure computational cost of calling this method.&#xA;Let us look at a deeper profiling profiler of this method:&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, WriteEscapedString does about 9% of work, then call WriteEscapedJavaScriptString, which make some calls to the StreamWriter. But about 33% of the time is spend doing its own thing, looking at the code, it is clear what is going on:&#xA;&#xA;Basically, before it can write anything, this code needs to go over the string and find out if it has any escape characters. If it does, it needs write the escape sequence, then resume writing the string. This means that this code has to scan the string that it is writing several times, and much worse, it means that you can&#x2019;t really do justice with those operations. Consider the string above, writing it out is actually several different calls to the writer. In fact, we have:&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;&#xA;Oren&#xA;\r&#xA;\n&#xA;Eini&#xA;&#x201C;&#xA;&#xA;The problem here is that we lose a very powerful feature, the ability to batch multiple operations into a single I/O call. Sure, the TextWriter is going to be doing a bit of buffering for us, but that doesn&#x2019;t help us really. Let us consider one of the most important calls we have in this code:&#xA;&#xA;For the string above, we call this method twice, once for each portion of the string that isn&#x2019;t escaped. That means that argument validation needs to run each and every time. And we also have to copy the memory in itsy bitsy pieces. Memory copy routines can get far greater speed if they can copy a large bunch of memory all at once, rather than being called on small sections of it.&#xA;In short, I hope that this convinced you that escaping strings is expensive. Stupidly so, when you come right down to it.&#xA;But what can you do, that is the cost of doing business, right?&#xA;Indeed, JSON.Net code is heavily optimized, and there isn&#x2019;t much you can do about improving things at this point. You are stuck with the JSON format and the implications of it.&#xA;This is already a long post, but bear with me while I explain the reasoning.&#xA;The blittable format isn&#x2019;t JSON. We read JSON and output JSON, but we aren&#x2019;t limited to the same constraints as someone who is just consuming JSON. There are two separate use cases for the document using the blittable format. The first is when we need to work with them on the server side. This include such things as indexing, transformers, patching, etc. For those cases, if there is an escaped value, we need to get the unescaped version. In other words, I need the string with the line break in it, not the \r\n escape sequences. The other common use case, unfortunately, is when we need to write the document to the user, in which case we do need to write it out with all of the escape sequences.&#xA;What is left for us, apparently, is to choose our poision. We can optimize for either scenario, but not for both.&#xA;Except, that maybe we can. And that is what we actually did.&#xA;When we write a string value into the blittable format, we read escape sequences, and translate them into their unescaped values. In other words, we take a &#x201C;\n&#x201D; and store just the byte 13. But we also remember its position. The string we keep talking about? It would be stored as:&#xA;[10][O][r][e][n][10][13][E][i][n][i][2][4][0]&#xA;The first byte (10), is the length of the string. Then we have the actual unescaped version. If the server side code wants to read this string, we can just serve it directly from this memory, without any additional work. But what about when we need to write it down, and maintain the escape sequences? That is where the numbers in the end come into play. We need to skip 10 bytes past the length, where we&#x2019;ll encounter 3 bytes: 2, 4, 0.&#xA;The first byte is the number of escape sequences in the string. The second is the number of bytes that we can copy until we get to the next escape sequence. Which means that our code for writing string has narrowed down to:&#xA;&#xA;And that, in turn, means that if you don&#x2019;t have any escape sequences, we can just call memcpy directly to write to the output buffer. And if you do have escape sequences, we just need to scan the escaped characters, we don&#x2019;t need to scan the entire string.&#xA;There is so much saving in the air, it feels like Black Friday.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Unlike previous posts in this series, this is actually something that happened to our own production server today. It resulted in our website being inaccessible for a a couple of hours, and like most such stories, its root cause is tremedously simple, and through a series of unfortunate accidents, it had escalated to a major issue. First, this post is dedicted to this book, which should be read by any self respecting developer whose code is expected to hit production.  This post is also written a few hours only after the incident was resolved. Before we actually implemented anything except a temporary workaround. I&#x2019;ll probably have another post in a couple of days to talk about the steps we are going to take to alleviate a repeat of this incident. The incident started innocently enough, when one of the guys on the team discovered that the startup time of a certain instance jumped by a lot. Investigating into why he realized that the issue was extremely slow responses from our server. That was a cause of triple concern, actually. First, why are we accepting such slow responses instead of time limiting them? Second, why are we making a remote syncronous call during startup? And third, why on Earth is our server so slow? Logging into the server, it didn&#x2019;t take long to see what the problem was. The www.RavenDB.net website (the code that runs the RavenDB website, not RavenDB itself) was consuming a lot of CPU and quite a bit of memory. In a bit to restore the other services which reside on the same box, we reset the process. Our main concern at the time was to restore service as soon as possible, and we planned on investigating further through the logs. However, in a few minutes, the www.RavenDB.net website started consuming more and more resources. At that point, we started considering a DoS attach of some sort and looked a the logs. The logs did show a very high number of requests, much more than I would expect. But looking further into them, it looked like they were mostly bots of various kinds indexing our site.  Considering that this might be the case of Google hammering us, we configured a robots.txt on the site and waited to see if this would have an impact. It didn&#x2019;t.  The next step was to take a process dump of the process, and then analyze it. During this period, we had to shut down www.RavenDB.net because it was killing all other services running on the server. Looking at the dump in WinDBG, we started with the obvious commands.  !runaway &#x2013; to find out the thread cpu times switching to the busiest threads !clrstack - to see what it is doing Honestly, this is a much nicer way of looking at this, though:  As you can see, the threads are currently actually doing parsing of a Razor template, and seems to be doing that on a fairly continous basis, consuming all system resources. At that point, I started getting concerned to the well being of the poor guy&#x2019;s inbox as a result of this code. That was the point where we actually did what should have probably been our first action, and looked at the error log of the website.  Previously, we looked at the live metrics and the request log, but didn&#x2019;t consider looking into the error log for the system. The error log for the website, for today only, was 6GB in size, and was pretty full of errors such as:   - error: (221, 88) &#x27;HibernatingRhinos.Orders.Common.EmailProcessing.EmailTemplates.RavenDBWebsite.Models.DownloadQuestionMailInput&#x27; does not contain a definition for &#x27;Unsubscribe&#x27; and no extension method &#x27;Unsubscribe&#x27; accepting a first argument of type And at that point, we had enough to point a suspicious finger. We have an email that we send out, and we used to have a valid template. At some point, the code was changed and the Unsubscribe was removed. Nothing broke because the template is just a file, not actually compiling code. However, in production, when we tried to send the email, Razor would parse the text, fail compilation because of the missing member, and basically thorw a hissy fit.  Update: We investigated further, and it looks like the following was the actual &#x201C;solution&#x201D; to the outage:  The &#x201C;solution&#x201D; is in quotes, becasue this fixes the problem, but we need to still implement steps to ensure that something like that doesn&#x2019;t repeat. Unforuntately, at that point, we would consider this email as failing, and move on to the next one. That next one would also fail, and so would the next one, etc. Because all of them failed, they would get picked up again next time this run.   Once we knew where the problem was. The workaround was to deploy a version with no email sending. For this weekend, that will work. But come Sunday, someone is going to go over this piece of code with a veyr fine comb. I&#x2019;ll post more about it once this actually roll around.</p>
