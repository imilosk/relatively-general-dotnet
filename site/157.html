I think it went quite well.Oren shares his story on how he taught himself how to code in &quot;Prison&quot; and became an open-source developer, coding a prison management system and how he founded Hibernating Rhinos. If you are an open-source developer or entrepreneur, you&#x27;ll find in this videocast some great ideas by Oren - about how to plan ahead and fail properly, promoting an open-source project, and giving advice to people who are beginning their journey in the open-source world.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I wrote about how I changed the structure of the hash leaf page to increase data density. I managed to get it down to 32MB range when I&#x2019;m using random keys. That is a pretty great number, for memory usage, but what is the cost in terms of performance?Well, let&#x2019;s figure it out, shall we? I added some tracing code and got the first result:3.124000 us/op with &#xA;32.007813 MBThat is not to shabby, right? Let&#x2019;s see where we are spending most of our time, shall we? I opened the profiler and got:Okay, that is a good point, isn&#x2019;t it? Changing to release mode gives us:1.471000 us/op with 32.007813 MBthat is much nicer, but still, profiler please&#x2026;As a side note, it actually takes less time to run the profiler than for it to analyze its output. I was looking at this for a while.The result was&#x2026; stunning:What is this thing? And why did it take almost 50% of my runtime?As it turns out, I was compiling for x86, and I&#x2019;m using a lot of shifts on 64 bits numbers. This _allshl seems to be part of the x86 runtime. That means that what I expected to be a cheap instruction on a register was actually a method call. That is interesting, but easy to fix. When running in Release/x64, we get the following results:0.723 us/op with &#xA;32.007813 MBOkay, so we are under a microsecond per op, and very reasonable memory, good to go, right?Well, remember that I did absolutely zero optimizations so far? What does the profiler tell us now? Here is an interesting hotspot:That is reasonable, we are benching this method, after all. But inside that method, we see:This is the part where we scan an existing piece to see if the value is inside it or not. This tell us if we need to add a new value or update an existing one. It make sense this will be hot, we have to do it on each put to the data related to the piece where we want to put the new key.There are a few ways to deal with this, we can try to move from the simple varint mode to a more complex (and performant) system. StreamVByte would probably be a good solution, in term of raw performance. But it is meant for 32 bits numbers and doesn&#x2019;t play nice with being able to remove and add values from the stream easily. I could also try to play games, instead of calling this function twice, call it once and pass both k and v. However, that is almost assuredly a false play. The varint method is small enough that it doesn&#x2019;t really matter, the compiler can inline it and play its own optimizations. Also, I tried it and there was no noticeable performance change, so that&#x2019;s down.Another way to deal with it is to reduce the number of times we call this function. And here is where things get interesting. Why is this called so much? Because during the put process, we find a page to put a value, then in that page, we find a piece (a 64 byte range) that we will put the key and value in. When we get to the piece, we need to check the already existing data if the key is there or not. So far, so good, but there is another factor to consider, overflows. A piece may overflow and spill into consecutive pieces. After all, that is what allowed us to reduce the memory usage from 147MB to just 32MB in the random integers scenario. However, that also means that we may need to scan much larger piece of the page. That explains why we are seeing so much usage of the decoding function. Let&#x2019;s look at the previous behavior, where we have no overflow at all?0.551000 us/op with 147.320313 MBThat is a much cheaper cost, but much higher memory. It looks like the typical compute vs. memory cycle, but let&#x2019;s look at the actual costs?You&#x2019;ll notice that we spend most of our time on increasing the hash table size, allocating and moving memory, etc. So even though we are faster, that isn&#x2019;t a good option for us.One thing to note, we are looking for the same key, and decoding all the data to find it. But we don&#x2019;t actually need to do that, we already have the key, and encoded it to its varint form. We can do a search on the raw encoded data to find it. It won&#x2019;t be good enough for the positive case (we may have a value that was encoded to the same form), but it should help for the common case of inserting a new value. If we find something with memmem(), we still need to decode the data itself and see if the pattern we found is a key or a value, but that should help. I tested it using GCC&#x2019;s implementation, and the performance dropped by almost 50%, it took 1.3 us/op! Maybe if I was using a SIMD optimized implementation, that would help, but given the kind of data we are looking for, it didn&#x2019;t pan out.Another option is to reduce the number of times we&#x2019;ll try to overflow a value. Right now, if we can&#x2019;t put a value in its proper place, we&#x2019;ll try putting it in any of the other locations. That means that we may probe as many as 127 pieces. It also means that during put, we have to scan overflow chains. As we saw in the previous post, that can add up to scanning up to 1.8 KB of data for a single put. What happens if we limit the overflow amount?Let&#x2019;s see if we limit the overflow to 32 probes. Now it only takes 0.403 us/op, which is a huge improvement. But what about the memory size? It&#x2019;s easier to look things up as a table:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Max chain&#xA;Overall Time (sec)&#xA;us/op&#xA;Size (MB)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;10.5450000.545000147.320313&#xA;20.3590000.35900075.156250&#xA;40.3720000.37200055.523438&#xA;80.3220000.32200036.882813&#xA;160.3360000.33600032.226563&#xA;320.4480000.44800032.007813&#xA;640.5960000.59600032.007813&#xA;1280.7700000.77000032.007813&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;These numbers are interesting, but let&#x2019;s look at them as a graph, shall we?We can see that the size drops sharply as the performance is best between 8 and 16 probe attempts, and all we are left choosing is the memory cost.If we go with 8 probe attempts, we&#x2019;ll pay with additional 4.875 MB, but with 16 probe attempts, we&#x2019;ll use just 224KB more with a cost of 0.044 us/op more than the optimal value.We could go to 32, of course, which gives us optimal size, with about 60% of the cost of doing the full scan. However, by paying just 224KB more, we get down to 43% of the initial cost. And that certainly seems like it is worth it.You can find the full source code (a little bit cleaned up) here.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I wrote before about an idea for designing the leaf page of an extendible hash page. The idea was to arrange things on a cache line size, which would reduce how much we&#x2019;ll need to search inside the page. On the other hand, it means that we might need to split whenever a particular 64 bits range is full. I went ahead an implemented that, just to see how it would work in practice. You can read the code here. Please note, this is testing code, so the point is to see how things work, not so much to do things properly. One really useful piece you&#x2019;ll find there is that I&#x2019;m outputting the structure of the hash to a graph. Being able to visually inspect the state of the system at various points has been invaluable to me.I have tested the implementation with two types on inputs. First, we have sequential keys and values. That is what I expect will be the most common use case that I have for this. It worked, but storing one million items results in just over 8 MB of memory being used. Given that my key &amp; value are 8 bytes each, that isn&#x2019;t too bad. In fact, that is pretty great. If we were storing this as an array, we would need about 15.2MB, so there are spacing savings there as well.Looking at the internal structure of the hash table, we see that all 64 bytes pieces hold some values (all between 42 &#x2013; 48 bytes). That is pretty great all around, open the champagne.I decided to see what kind of behavior we&#x2019;ll see when we have a random distribution. The situation was&#x2026; worse. In fact, storing one million random keys and values takes 147MB. Yes, that is for when you can store the whole data in just 15.2 MB in its raw form.To be fair, one of the advantages that we have for sequential values is that we use varints to store the values, so they compress well. With random values, we don&#x2019;t really benefit from that. I tested this again with different ranges of values. With random values up to 2^32, we get a hash table that over 44MB in size and when we limit the range to ten millions, we use &#x201C;merely&#x201D; 27MB. The issue is fairly simple, the moment we have a 64 bytes range full, we are forced to do a page split. That lead us to high fragmentation, which is not desirable at all. With random distribution, it is likely that we&#x2019;ll hit the 64 bytes capacity easily on each page, leading to very high fragmentation. Amusingly enough, the sequential mode will not have this, because this will spread the values neatly along the different pieces in a page. The answer to that is to move to an open addressing mode inside the page. In other words, when we have a 64 bytes piece that is full, we&#x2019;ll mark it as having overflowed and put the value on the subsequent piece. That would allow us to spill over the values across the entire page much more efficiently. It does complicates deletions, but we&#x2019;ll manage.Implementing that feature took a little bit, but here is the result. For the case of random keys and values, we go to a total memory usage of 32 MB, a very significant improvement. There has been no change for the sequential mode, which was already optimal for our scenario.When values are in the 2^32 range, we use 16 MB and for ten million range, we get 8MB. These numbers are pretty awesome, even if I say so myself.For comparison, I wrote this C# program, which merely store 1 million 16 bytes key pairs. That is basically what I&#x2019;m doing in my code, and it was interesting to compare the memory consumption between the two. The C# version took 37.2 MB, compared to the bad result I had of 32MB in my code.Looking at the actual overflow count, on the random data case, it look like we have the following stats:Max overflow chain (overflow pieces that are next to one another): 29Total number of chains: 107,830Average chain length: 2.35In other words, we have a 10% chance in this case of hitting an overflow chain (meaning that we need to check more than 64 bytes of data to see if the key exists). When this happens, we&#x2019;ll usually scan 128 &#x2013; 192 bytes, but may scan up to 1.8 KB of sequential memory. There are a total of 1,388 cases where we have more than 10 consecutive overflow pieces (1% chance of hitting that) and only 64 cases where the chain is greater than 20.Overall, these numbers looks good to me. As usual, comments are welcome. I would appreciate any feedback you may have.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">An extendible hash is composed of a directory section, which point to leaf pages, and the leaf pages, where the actual data resides.&#xA;My current implementation is incredibly na&#xEF;ve, though. The leaf page has an array of records (two int64 values, for key &amp; value) that we scan through to find a match. That works, but it works badly. It means that you have to scan through a lot of records (up to 254, if the value isn&#x2019;t found). At the same time, we also waste quite a bit of space here. We need to store int64 keys and values, but the vast majority of them are going to be much smaller.&#xA0;&#xA;Voron uses 8KB pages, with 64 bytes page header, leaving us with 8,128 bytes for actual data. I want to kill two birds in one design decision here. Handling both the lookup costs as well as the space costs. Another factor that I have to keep in mind is that complexity kills.&#xA;The RavenDB project had a number of dedicated hash tables over the years, for specific purposes. Some of them were quite fancy and optimized to the hilt. They were also complex. In a particular case, a particular set of writes and deletes meant that we lost an item in the hash table. It was there, but because we used linear probing on collision, and there was an issue with deleting a value under some cases where we would mark the first colliding key as removed, but didn&#x2019;t move the second colliding key to its rightful place. If this make sense to you, you can appreciate the kind of bug that this caused. It only happened in very particular cases, very hard to track down and caused nasty issues. If you don&#x2019;t follow the issue description, just assume that it was complex and hard to figure out. I don&#x2019;t like complexity, this is part of why I enjoy extendible hashing so much, it is such a brilliant idea, and so simple in concept.&#xA;So whatever method we are talking about, it has to allow fast lookups, be space efficient and not be complex.&#xA;The idea is simple, we&#x2019;ll divide the space available in our page to 127 pieces, each with 64 bytes in size. The first byte on each piece will be used to hold the number of entries used in this piece, and the rest of the data will hold varint encoded pairs of keys and values. It might be easier to understand if we&#x2019;ll look at the code:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

For writes, you need to do a bit more house keeping, but not a lot more of it. Some key observations about this piece of code:&#xA;&#xA;We need to scan only a single 64 bytes buffer. This fits into a CPU cache line, so it is safe to assume that the cost of actually scanning it for a match is actually much lower than fetching from main memory.&#xA;We discard all the common prefix of the page, using its depth value. The rest is used as a modulus index directly into the specified location.&#xA;There is no complexity around linear probing, closed / open addressing, etc. This is because our system can&#x2019;t have collisions.&#xA;&#xA;Actually, the last part is a lie. You are going to get two values that end up in the same piece, obviously. That is a collision, but that require no other special handling. The fun part here is that when we fill a piece completely, we&#x2019;ll need to split the whole page. That will automatically spread the data across two pages and we get our load factor for free .&#xA;Analyzing the cost of lookup in such a scheme, we have:&#xA;&#xA;Bit shifts to index into the right bucket (I&#x2019;m assuming that the directory itself is fully resident in memory).&#xA;We also need the header of the bucket, so we&#x2019;ll need to read it as well (Here we may have disk read).&#xA;Modulus constant and then direct addressing to the relevant piece (covered by the previous disk read).&#xA;Scan 64 bytes to find a particular key using varint.&#xA;&#xA;So in all, we read about 192 bytes (counting values in cache lines) and a single disk read. I expect this to be a pretty efficient result, in both time and space.</p>
