        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had a chat with a pal of mine recently, about why he would recommend working with Web Forms over MonoRail.    The short answer was that he didn&#x27;t want to end up with an ungooglable exception. The reasoning is that there isn&#x27;t any nook or crany in Web Forms that hasn&#x27;t been discovered, talked about, solved, and most importantly than all, indexed by Google.    I don&#x27;t agree with this approach, but I recognize that this is a valid way of operating. The major reason that I don&#x27;t agree with this is that I have run into issues with ASP.Net that were essentially un-googlable and undebuggable.     Castle currently has four or five major projects ( I was surprised myself, I expected it to be at least a two digit number ).    Learning each of them by itself is not hard, at least not in the &quot;good enough to work with and learn on the job&quot;. Getting to a master level isn&#x27;t any harder than in any other technologies, it just takes time and experiance.    There are certainly quite a few more experts in Web Forms than about MonoRail, but I find that I have to struggle to get what I want a lot less in MonoRail, and I get into far less situations that require the use of an expert. One of the core principals of Castle is that it should be simple. And by simple I don&#x27;t mean the implementation, but the usage. It takes a minute to explain how SmartDispatcherController works, and any programmer can grasp how it can be used from three sentences. The implementation of the Smart Dispatching is quite complex, but you never need to see it.    One of the main differences between OSS and Commercial software is the amount of time that is invested in the frills. Active Record and NHibernate has a designer, which is nice, but it is not a level 1 priority to any of the people using either Active Record or NHibernate. The reason is that both those frameworks were built knowing that a designer is not something that you should need in order to work with them.     WebForms has a huge task on developing custom controls. Not only must the control play nice in the page life cycle dance, they also need to jump through many many hops in order to work in the designer. MonoRail&#x27;s ViewComponents, on the other hand, are literally HTML generators, with no extra complexity on top of them. Again, the simple outward interface makes it easy to work with the frameworks.    Some of those things require a fair shift in thinking, but once you get comfortable with MonoRail, there is no steep learning curve until you get to Windsor integration, which simply require that you understand how IoC works. Instead, there is a lot of discovery going on, mostly with helpers, filters, and such.    Now, Castle&#x27;s is built of many projects that are designed to be used independantly. But, they are also designed to work together. This means that the Whule Is Truly Greatly Than The Sum Of Its Parts. Taking Active Record, MonoRail and Windsor for a spin is a fun ride, but that require that you understand all three, and their interactions. The nice thing about it is that it is not that big of a jump from knowing them to working with them together.    To summarize, a basic working knowledge of Castle is probably something that you would want to have before you would start building applications with it. There are numerous getting started guides out there right now, which can help you grok what you are trying to do. I don&#x27;t believe that you need an expert on hand to solve problems, looking at the forums&#xA0;or asking in the mailing list will usually get you the answers that you seek. There is also a lot of effort in making the exceptions detailed and&#xA0;self explenatory.    Naturally, I am biased, so I am not sure that my opinion in this matter counts, what do you think?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">At least this time I managed to last a week. New release with a bunch of new features:            Stubs are obvious in, here is my previous post about them and the documentation                Added logging support for Rhino Mocks - this means that you can now get clearer information about what is going on, you can configure the logging using:        RhinoMocks.Logger&#xA0;=&#xA0;new&#xA0;TextWriterExpectationLogger&#xA0;(Console.Out);                Right now the implementation would simply write the method calls, but it is possible to generate &quot;Expect.Call&quot; syntax from the information (patches are welcome :-) ).            Applied patch from Stefan Podskubka - adding List.Count and List.Element constraints.                                     Expect            .Call(query.SetParaemters()).Constraints(List.Count(Is.GreaterThan(5)))                            And:                                                     Expect            .Call(query.SetParaemters()).Constraints(List.Element(2, Is.Equal(null)))                                    Fixed an issue where the wrong count of expected calls is reported.    You can get the code and the binaries here.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">From Wikipedia:Innovation is the introduction of new ideas, goods, services, and practices which are intended to be useful (though a number of unsuccessful innovations can be found throughout history). The main driver for innovation is often the courage and energy to better the world.     It may be because I am not a native English speaker, but to me the word innovation also carry the idea that the new thing that was created was novel, something beyond a mere evolutionary improvement of the existing.    Given that definition, it drives me crazy to hear Microsoft talk about innovation. The main issue that I have with that is that they seem to equate innovation with work:A lot of innovation went into this...    Yes, they do some really cool stuff, but do they really need to use the word innovation for everything? Microsoft is doing a lot of things that I would consider as hard-code innovation, the problem is that they apply this word to anything from spell checking to a new icon to rounded corner on a grid.    &lt;/rant&gt;</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After my last post in the matter, Jeremy Boyd&#xA0;has been gracious enough to track down the problem and send me a complete solution.&#xA0; Jan Van Ryswyck was the one that pointed me at how to solve another problem&#xA0;with WCF, that I never would have assoicated with the first issue.     WCF has three places that you need to touch to setup the namespace of a service. The interface - using [ServiceContract] -&#xA0;the implementation -&#xA0;using [ServiceBehavior] - and the binding - using bindingNamespace=&quot;&quot;. I am not sure why you need to touch so many places in order to change a namespace, and I am really not fond of the implementation changing the public interface of a service, but that is another story. There are probably some cases where you want three different namespaces.     At any rate, the way WCF handles different namespaces is by generating wsdl:import and xsd:import declaration, which are apperantly not supported very well by quite a few tools. The key here is that if they are all in the same namespace, you don&#x27;t get the import declaration, and the tools can consume the WSDL just fine!     So, here is the code from last time:            [ServiceContract(Namespace=http://www.ayende.com/&quot;)]        public&#xA0;interface&#xA0;ISsisNotifications        {        &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;[OperationContract]        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;void&#xA0;UpdatedDatabase();        }                        [ServiceBehavior(Namespace=http://www.ayende.com/&quot;)]        public&#xA0;class&#xA0;SsisNotifications&#xA0;:&#xA0;ISsisNotifications        {        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;public&#xA0;void&#xA0;UpdatedDatabase()        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;{        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;}        }        And we need to configure it like this:            &lt;service behaviorConfiguration=&quot;ExposeMetaData&quot; name=&quot;My.SsisNotifications&quot;&gt;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;endpoint address=&quot;http://my-machine//Services/SsisNotifications.svc&quot;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; bindingNamespace=&quot;http://www.ayende.com/&quot;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; binding=&quot;basicHttpBinding&quot; contract=&quot;My.ISsisNotifications&quot; /&gt;                 &lt;/service&gt;         And now SSIS can consume this service without issues.    (Victory dance)</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Udi has been talking lately about using spaces. Spaces are a distributed hash table that has the following operations: Write/Read/Take/Notify. The idea is that you can put entities or messages in the space, and something will handle them for you.     I find the idea interesting, since I had the chance to build such a system (~20 - 50 workers, each doing their own little part, independant from others) on a single machine. It turn out that this is a very nice approach to separating responsabilities and getting things done.    Scaling it out to a distibuted approach is interesting. I am going to ignore Udi&#x27;s suggestion to get a ready-made solution and think about the way I would implement it. Just to make it interesting, I will throw in as many technologies as possible. Remember, this is a thought experiment.    Distributed hash table... hm, where did I heard that before? Memcached is exacatly what this is talking about and using it makes Read / Write / Take operations very easy, and notify nearly impossible. Obviously notify is a critical piece here, so I would rule Memcached out for now, it may be used as our backend, but it can&#x27;t be the primary technology.    WCF has a peer to peer capabilities, and it may be interesting to try that. Read / Write / Take now becomes interesting, not in the implementation, but rather in deciding where to put the data? Ideally, I want to be ignorant of where the data is physically at, while maintaining the hash table aspect of it.    This means that for a read operation with a known key, I should be able to go to the exact node that contains the data that I want. This probably means that P2P is out, since I don&#x27;t want to query the mesh in order to get a response, I would like to communicate directly with nodes. This bring me to a design decision, do I assume that we are using a mostly reliable and static set of nodes, or do I want to go for unreliable, dynamic nodes. The first means that I can do a simple hash of the key, mod by the number of known nodes, and go directly to the node by index.    This is how Memcached works, basically a two way hashtable. The problem with that is handling failures and additions. Because failures and additions both distrub the key distributions and require re-shuffling of the data. This is not so important in a cache, which is (by definition) allowed to lose data, but it is much more important if I am going to put business data there.    I think that I will decide on the second approach, unreilable and dynamic it is. This means that the operations for the infrastructure are now: Read / Write / Take / Notify - which is what the user is familiar with, but on the wire, we have:            FindFor(key) - search the P2P mesh for the node that has this key            FindPlaceFor(key, size, attributes) - search the P2P mesh for a node that is willing to accept the data            [Read | Write | Take]Direct - talk directly to the node&#xA0;- doesn&#x27;t use the P2P mesh, rather talks directly to the node            Notify - sends a notify request on the mesh, where all the nodes will pick it up.    Now, let us think about notify, which is actually the reason that I started all this. We basically want to pass some sort of a query that will return results for us. When I am thinking about a query, there are several options, we can use something like this as the client side API:            var&#xA0;query&#xA0;=&#xA0;from&#xA0;msg&#xA0;in&#xA0;Space.OrderMessages        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;where&#xA0;msg.Status&#xA0;==&#xA0;OrderMessageStatus.ReadyToShip;        Space.Notification&#xA0;&#x2B;=&#xA0;OnMessageNotified;        Space.Notify(query);        But how is this implemented? I can think of two ways, either NHibernate criteria or Lucene queries. I am probably going to lean toward Lucene here, it is much faster for mostly search scenarios, and very easy to work with.    A client for the mesh would expose an end point for getting notified about the messages, here I&#x27;ll probably pass either the node id and the data, or just the node id and the key. Probably the second, so I can get reliable results in the case of more than a single client for the same type of message.    Transactions are a problem, though. We would usually want to do several operations, and I would really like them to run in a transaction. This is more complicated because I may need to interact with several nodes in&#xA0;a single transaction. I am not familiar enough with WCF to know how to make this work, although I do believe that this is possible.    ThoughtExperiment.End();</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Phil Haack just posted some code that made me wince:&#xA;&#xA;        [Test]                    &#xA;        public void DemoLegsProperty()                    &#xA;        {                    &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; MockRepository mocks = new MockRepository();                    &#xA;                &#xA0;            &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; //Creates an IAnimal stub&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;                     &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; IAnimal animalMock = (IAnimal)mocks.DynamicMock(typeof(IAnimal));                    &#xA;                &#xA0;            &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; //Makes the Legs property actually work, creating a fake.            &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; SetupResult.For(animalMock.Legs).PropertyBehavior();            &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; mocks.ReplayAll();                    &#xA;                &#xA0;            &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; animalMock.Legs = 0;                    &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Assert.AreEqual(0, animalMock.Legs);            &#xA;                &#xA0;            &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; SomeClass instance = new SomeClass(animalMock);                    &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; instance.SetLegs(10);                    &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Assert.AreEqual(10, animalMock.Legs);            &#xA;        }    &#xA;&#xA;    The reason that it made me wince is that it is such a common scenario, and there are four lines of Rhino Mocks code here that just doesn&#x27;t add any value to the test. The test is trying to verify that calling SetLegs on SomeClass will set the animal leg. Very trivial test, but about half of it is spent just setting up Rhino Mocks.&#xA;    I don&#x27;t like that.&#xA;    Here is my version:&#xA;&#xA;        [Test]                    &#xA;        public void DemoLegsProperty()                    &#xA;        {                    &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; IAnimal animalStub = MockRepository.GenerateStub&lt;IAnimal&gt;();            &#xA;                &#xA0;            &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; animalStub.Legs = 0;                    &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Assert.AreEqual(0, animalStub.Legs);            &#xA;                &#xA0;            &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; SomeClass instance = new SomeClass(animalStub);                    &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; instance.SetLegs(10);                    &#xA;        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Assert.AreEqual(10, animalStub.Legs);            &#xA;        }    &#xA;&#xA;    Well, I cheated, I added this functionality to Rhino Mocks :-) Now we have a single line of Rhino Mocks code, which is very explicit about what it is doing.&#xA;    The code is already in the repository, and I plan to release an update today, along with a bunch of other stuff.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After reading a bit about Jasper, I decided that I would like to see what it would take to build it with NHibernate and Boo. I am going to implement it and write the post at the same time, so you would get near real time documentation of the process.            18:05, decided that I want this syntax:                                     import Bumbler                                                                        &#xA0;                                                        conStr = &quot;Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated Security=True;&quot;;                                                                        &#xA0;                                                        bumble = Bumble.Through(conStr)                                                        for customer in bumble.Customers:                                                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; print &quot;Customer ${customer.ContactName}&quot;                                                      c                         = bumble.GetCustomer(&quot;TRADH&quot;)                         19:10, finished building client interface and quick &amp; dirty mapping from database implementation.                 19:24, finished code generation, now working on runtime compilcation...                 19:54: finished runtime code generation                 20:13, can now successfully query the database using NHibernate just from connection string. Starting to work on dynamic implementation.                 20:16, done basic dynamics, now playing with Booish.                 20:21, the code above now works, and I am going for dinner.                 21:10, back from dinner, final polish...                 21:13, done!    So, about two hours of work, most of which had to do with generating the mapping from the database. I have cut some corners there, so it is SQL Server only, and it can&#x27;t support a legacy app, adding support for the more complex cases is simply adding it to the mapping generation, nothing else. I made sure that adding new functionality would be easy, however.    Right now, you can get the code, just run the application, and you will get a shell that you can use to interact with the objects and the database. You need to start a new Bumble (you can simply cut/paste the code above) and then play with it. You can also reference the assembly and work with it directly using Boo.
