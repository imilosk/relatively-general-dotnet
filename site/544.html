Rob and I built the UI side of the application, and we learned a lot in the process. I&#x2019;d like to do a talk were we discuss the challenges of the project, how we solved them, and what we did wrong.    Yes, NHProf will be included too. (I submitted a case study for it last year, and it didn&#x2019;t get picked. I have to sneak it in).     A few interesting aspects:         we built this using MVVM, but well before Caliburn reached maturity.       the four separate apps (NHProf, EFProf, L2SProf, HProf) all use a single code base.       we&#x2019;re about to port the project from WPF to Silverlight.      Please vote for this session.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jose was kind enough to post a review of my sample Effectus application. This post is a reply to that.  The first thing that Jose didn&#x2019;t like was the fact that I didn&#x2019;t put an abstraction layer in front of NHibernate&#x2019;s usage in my application. There are several reasons for that, the first, and simplest, is that I was trying to explain how to use NHibernate, and for that, I wanted to deal with the lowest common denominator, not show off a particular wrapper implementation. Showing NHibernate usage directly means that even if you are using another library with it, you would still be able to take advantage of the information that I give you.  Second, and quite important, is that by using NHibernate directly I can take advantage of NHibernate features explicitly meant to support certain scenarios, but which are not likely to be expose when libraries wrap NHibernate. A good example of that is in Jose&#x2019;s sample code, which make use of an ISession instead of IStatelessSession to load the data for the main screen. As explained in the article, the difference between the two is important, and in the context where it is used it introduce what is effectively a memory leak into Jose&#x2019;s implementation, as well as the chance for some really interesting errors down the road if the session will run into an error.  Third, Jose bring up the following:     This presenter is GLUED to NHibernate. And this means for instance that you can&#x2019;t test it without NHibernate, and this means that you can&#x2019;t change your persistence layer.   Yes, and that is intentional. That is the very task that those presenters are for. Trying to abstract that away just means that I put an additional layer of abstraction that does absolutely nothing. For that matter, let us look at Jose&#x2019;s implementation using an abstraction layer compared to mine.  Here is my implementation:     private void LoadPage(int page)&#xA;{&#xA;    using (var tx = StatelessSession.BeginTransaction())&#xA;    {&#xA;        var actions = StatelessSession.CreateCriteria&lt;ToDoAction&gt;()&#xA;            .SetFirstResult(page * PageSize)&#xA;            .SetMaxResults(PageSize)&#xA;            .List&lt;ToDoAction&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;        var total = StatelessSession.CreateCriteria&lt;ToDoAction&gt;()&#xA;            .SetProjection(Projections.RowCount())&#xA;            .UniqueResult&lt;int&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;        this.NumberOfPages.Value = total / PageSize &#x2B; (total % PageSize == 0 ? 0 : 1);&#xA;        this.Model = new Model&#xA;        {&#xA;            Actions = new ObservableCollection&lt;ToDoAction&gt;(actions),&#xA;            NumberOfPages = NumberOfPages,&#xA;            CurrentPage = CurrentPage &#x2B; 1&#xA;        };&#xA;        this.CurrentPage.Value = page;&#xA;&#xA;        tx.Commit();&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;And here is Jose&#x2019;s:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  private void LoadPage(int page)&#xA;{&#xA;    var actions = _toDoActionsDao.RetrieveAll()&#xA;                                 .Skip(page * PageSize)&#xA;                                 .Take(PageSize).ToList();&#xA;&#xA;    var total = _toDoActionsDao.RetrieveAll().Count();&#xA;    &#xA;    NumberOfPages.Value = total / PageSize &#xA;                        &#x2B; (total % PageSize == 0 ? 0 : 1);&#xA;    &#xA;    Model = new Model&#xA;    {&#xA;        Actions = new ObservableCollection&lt;ToDoAction&gt;(actions),&#xA;        NumberOfPages = NumberOfPages,&#xA;        CurrentPage = CurrentPage &#x2B; 1&#xA;    };&#xA;    &#xA;    CurrentPage.Value = page;&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;The code is still doing the exact same thing, in other words, we haven&#x2019;t moved any logic away, and most of the code is dealing with data access details. My approach for testing this is to make use of an in memory database, which result in a single test that make sure that the code works, instead of a series of tests that verifies that each piece work independently and then my single test. I find it much more effective in terms of time &amp; effort.&#xA;&#xA;As for the idea of changing your persistence layer, forget about it. It isn&#x2019;t going to happen in any real world application without a lot of effort, so you might as well save yourself the effort of working with the lowest common denominator and take full advantage of the framework. Just to note, when I ported the NerdDinner code to NHibernate (an application that make use of a single table), I had to make major changes to the application.&#xA;&#xA;Jose didn&#x2019;t like this method:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  public void OnSave()&#xA;{&#xA;    bool successfulSave;&#xA;    try&#xA;    {&#xA;        using (var tx = Session.BeginTransaction())&#xA;        {&#xA;            // this isn&#x27;t strictly necessary, NHibernate will &#xA;            // automatically do it for us, but it make things&#xA;            // more explicit&#xA;            Session.Update(Model.Action);&#xA;&#xA;            tx.Commit();&#xA;        }&#xA;        successfulSave = true;&#xA;    }&#xA;    catch (StaleObjectStateException)&#xA;    {&#xA;        var mergeResult = Presenters.ShowDialog&lt;MergeResult?&gt;(&quot;Merge&quot;, Model.Action);&#xA;        successfulSave = mergeResult != null;&#xA;&#xA;        ReplaceSessionAfterError();&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    // we call ActionUpdated anyway, either we updated the value ourselves&#xA;    // or we encountered a concurrency conflict, in which case we _still_&#xA;    // want other parts of the application to update themselves with the values&#xA;    // from the db&#xA;    EventPublisher.Publish(new ActionUpdated&#xA;    {&#xA;        Id = Model.Action.Id&#xA;    }, this);&#xA;&#xA;    if (successfulSave)&#xA;        View.Close();&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Because:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  ReplaceSessionAfterError, to much responsibility for a presenter. &#xA;&#xA;  Session/Transaction again. &#xA;&#xA;  There is a BUG, the publish mechanism work in sync with the rest of the code. This means&#x2026; that this windows is not going to close until others have finished handling the event. For the given example, the Edit windows is not going to close until the main window finish to refresh the current page. &#xA;&#xA;  Too much logic for this method = hard to test.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I fully agree that this is a complex method, and Jose&#x2019;s refactoring for that is an improvement indeed.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  [PersistenceConversation(ConversationEndMode = EndMode.End)]public virtual void OnSave()&#xA;{&#xA;    _toDoActionsDao.Update(Model.Action);&#xA;&#xA;    EventPublisher.Enlist(new ActionUpdated&#xA;    {&#xA;        Id = Model.Action.Id&#xA;    }, this);&#xA;&#xA;    View.Close();&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public override void OnException(Exception exception)&#xA;{&#xA;    if(exception is StaleEntityException)&#xA;    {&#xA;        Presenters.ShowDialog&lt;MergeResult?&gt;(&quot;Merge&quot;, Model.Action);&#xA;&#xA;        EventPublisher.Enlist(new ActionUpdated&#xA;        {&#xA;            Id = Model.Action.Id&#xA;        }, this);&#xA;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Jose has implemented the following changes:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  I&#x2019;ve defined a new convention, if a public method in the presenter throw an exception, the OnException method will be called. This is done by a castle interceptor, and this is the last line of defense for unhandled exceptions. &#xA;&#xA;  I&#x2019;m using &#x201C;StaleEntityException&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;StaleObjectStateException&#x201D;, this is MY exception. This is easily done by a CpBT artifact. &#xA;&#xA;  I&#x2019;m not calling &#x201C;EventPublisher.Publish&#x201D; anymore, this code use EventPublisher.Enlist. Here, I&#x2019;ve split the &#x201C;Publish&#x201D; code in two different methods one for Enlist and other for Raise. The enlisted events will be raised right after the OnSave method is called and thus after the windows is closed. &#xA;&#xA;  Also, notice that here is the conversation per business transaction pattern with all its splendor. The two former methods are conversation participants, with EndMode equals to continue. This means that the NH Session will remain opened. The OnSave method has EndMode equals to End, this means that right after the method finished, CpBT internally will flush the Unit of Work and close it.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is better than the original implementation, but I think it can be made better still. First, OnException as a generic method is a bad idea. For the simple reason that the exception logic for different method is different, I would probably define a [MethodName]Error(Exception e) convention instead, which would make it easier to separate the error logic for different methods.&#xA;&#xA;Again, I don&#x2019;t find any usefulness in abstracting the underlying framework, I haven&#x2019;t seen a single case where it was useful, but I have seen a lot of cases where it was hurting the team &amp; the project.&#xA;&#xA;The idea about splitting the publication and raising is really nice, I agree.&#xA;&#xA;However, there is a problem in the code with regards to session handling in cases of error. There is a pretty good reason why I introduced the ReplaceSessionAfterError method. In general, I want to keep my session alive for the duration of the form, because I get a lot of benefits out of that. But, if the session has run into an error, I need to replace it and all the objects associated with it. Closing the session no matter what is going on is not a good solution, and you can&#x2019;t really solve the problem in a generic way without calling back to the presenter that generated the error.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got a request in email to add something like Disqus to my blog, which would allow a richer platform for the commenting that goes on here. I think that the request and my reply are interesting enough to warrant this blog post.   My comment system is the default subtext one, but there are several advantages to the way it works. You can read the full explanation in Joel on Software post about the matter, but basically, threading encourages people to go off in tangents, single thread of conversation make it significantly easier to have only one conversation.  There is another reason, which is personally important to me, which is that I want to &quot;own&quot; the comments. Not own in terms of copyright, but own in terms of having control of the data itself. Having the comments (a hugely important part of the blog) being managed by a 3rd party which might shut down and take all the comments with it is not acceptable.  That is probably a false fear, but it is something that I take under consideration. The reasoning about the type of interaction going on in the comments is a lot more important. There is also something else to consider, if a post gets too hot (generating too many comments), I am either going to close comments on it, or open a new post with summary of what went on in the previous post comment thread anyway, so it does have some checks &amp; balances that keep a comment thread from growing too large.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Let us see if you can help me here, I found myself facing a rather unpleasant realization, in that I need to communicate between two processes (that compose a single system) with some rather draconian measures about how they are going to be used.  Quite simply, I need to expose an interface with ~25 methods on it to the second process. So far, it is pretty easy to do, right?  The problem is that the first process is a standard .NET executable, which may also be run on the Mono platform while the second is a Silverlight application. My first thought, just use remoting to handle this, failed because remoting isn&#x2019;t available to Silverlight. My second thought, to use WCF, failed because that isn&#x2019;t available on Mono.  Building a simple RPC system is pretty easy, so that doesn&#x2019;t worry me. The reason I am reluctant to do so is that I really don&#x2019;t want to build yet another infrastructure. At some point, even to me, NIH flag starts to pop up.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was quite amazed by the number of conspiracy theories that were brought up by this post. Some of them in the comments, some of them in private communications.  The reason, the real &amp; only one, that I had so many posts lately about performance is quite simple. I did a lot of that recently, and one aspect of perf testing that I didn&#x2019;t talk about is that most perf test run takes a long time, that means that I had a lot of free time. Free time for me usually translate into posting time :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a question that I get very frequently, and I always tried to dodged the bullet, but I get it so much that I feel that I have to provide an answer. Obviously, I am (not so) slightly biased toward NHibernate, so while you read it, please keep it in mind.  EF 4.0 has done a lot to handle the issues that were raised with the previous version of EF. Thinks like transparent lazy loading, POCO classes, code only, etc. EF 4.0 is a much nicer than EF 1.0.   The problem is that it is still a very young product, and the changes that were added only touched the surface. I already talked about some of my problems with the POCO model in EF, so I won&#x2019;t repeat that, or my reservations with the Code Only model. But basically, the major problem that I have with those two is that there seems to be a wall between what experience of the community and what Microsoft is doing. Both of those features shows much of the same issues that we have run into with NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate. Issues that were addressed and resolved, but show up in the EF implementations.  Nevertheless, even ignoring my reservations about those, there are other indications that NHibernate&#x2019;s maturity makes itself known. I run into that several times while I was writing the guidance for EF Prof, there are things that you simple can&#x2019;t do with EF, that are a natural part of NHibernate.  I am not going to try to do a point by point list of the differences, but it is interesting to look where we do find major differences between the capabilities of NHibernate and EF 4.0. Most of the time, it is in the ability to fine tune what the framework is actually doing. Usually, this is there to allow you to gain better performance from the system without sacrificing the benefits of using an OR/M in the first place.  Here is a small list:     Write batching &#x2013; NHibernate can be configured to batch all writes to the database so that when you need to write several statements to the database, NHibernate will only make a single round trip, instead of going to the database per each statement.     Read batching / multi queries / futures &#x2013; NHibernate allows to batch several queries into a single round trip to the database, instead of separate roundtrip per each query.     Batched collection loads &#x2013; When you lazy load a collection, NHibernate can find other collections of the same type that weren&#x2019;t loaded, and load all of them in a single trip to the database. This is a great way to avoid having to deal with SELECT N&#x2B;1.     Collection with lazy=&#x201D;extra&#x201D; &#x2013; Lazy extra means that NHibernate adapts to the operations that you might run on top of your collections. That means that blog.Posts.Count will not force a load of the entire collection, but rather would create a &#x201C;select count(*) from Posts where BlogId = 1&#x201D; statement, and that blog.Posts.Contains() will likewise result in a single query rather than paying the price of loading the entire collection to memory.     Collection filters and paged collections&#xA0; - this allows you to define additional filters (including paging!) on top of your entities collections, which means that you can easily page through the blog.Posts collection, and not have to load the entire thing into memory.     2nd level cache &#x2013; managing the cache is complex, I touched on why this is important before, so I&#x2019;ll skip if for now.     Tweaking &#x2013; this is something that is critical whenever you need something that is just a bit beyond what the framework provides. With NHibernate, in nearly all the cases, you have an extension point, with EF, you are completely and utterly blocked.     Integration &amp; Extensibility &#x2013; NHibernate has a lot of extension projects, such as NHibernate Search, NHibernate Validator, NHibernate Shards, etc. Such projects not only do not exists for EF, but they cannot be written, for the most part, because EF has no extension points to speak of.   On the other side, however:     EF 4.0 has a better Linq provider than the current NHibernate implementation. This is something being actively worked on and the NH 3.0 will fix this gap.     EF is from Microsoft.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am currently in the process of building support for the production profiling. The technical part (how to reduce the footprint of the profiler when not profiling) is pretty easy, and I spiked it out in a matter of a few hours. The non technical part has been driving me mad for days.  One of the major issues that I have to deal with with regards to production profiling is the issue of security. There are actually multiple levels to this issue. The most obvious one is that we want to secure who can start profiling. Initially I thought that providing a password and limiting IP range that can connect to the profiling endpoint would be enough, but I quickly realized that I am being overly naive.  The idea that someone can just hook into all the communication that goes on with the database is something that will give any security analyst heart palpitations. Not only do I need to secure access to the endpoint, I also need to ensure that no one can sniff this traffic, as it might very well include sensitive information. Beyond that, just to make sure that the aforementioned security analyst doesn&#x2019;t show up at my door armed &amp; pissed, it is important that only the system administrator (and not the developers) can turn that on.  That one isn&#x2019;t so much to catch maliciousness, as much as to prevent people from deploying to production with their debug configuration enabled, but will also stop malicious acts of trying to open up holes in the application.  After some investigation, I decided that I probably want to use SSL (and the SslStream implementation in the BCL) to do that. This has several advantages, it means that the network traffic is encrypted and I can ignore that aspect. It also means that I can take advantage on mutual authentication to ensure that the client is really authorized to do connect to me. Finally, I can also require that the certificate will be installed on the server machine, thus meeting the requirement of the system administrator having to take an explicit step to allow it.  From design perspective, it looks nice, so the next question was to write some code to spike it. I should preface everything that follows with the admission that I have only rudimentary knowledge of the actual details of SSL and certificates. But basically, what I thought was to have the following:     Server certificate &#x2013; self signed, server auth, bound to a particular hostname, not CA.    Client certificate &#x2013; self signed, client auth, bound to a particular hostname, not CA.   The client certificate would need to be added as a trusted root on the server. That would allow mutual authentication between the two parties. The server will reject unknown certs or ones that do not bind to the same hostname as the server cert. I am not sure if I should require that the server cert would have to be installed on the client machine, but I am leaning on not requiring that.  Thoughts? Anything else that I might need to think about? Is this scheme really secure? Is it going to cause the ops people to go mad?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got a comment in this post suggesting that the code can make use of the EnterUpgradeableReadLock method to simplify this code:     public static string Intern(string str)&#xA;{&#xA;    string val;&#xA;    &#xA;    locker.EnterReadLock();&#xA;    try&#xA;    {&#xA;        if(strings.TryGetValue(str, out val))&#xA;            return val;&#xA;    }&#xA;    finally&#xA;    {&#xA;        locker.ExitReadLock();&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    locker.EnterWriteLock();&#xA;    try&#xA;    {&#xA;        if(strings.TryGetValue(str, out val))&#xA;            return val;&#xA;            &#xA;        strings.Add(str,str);&#xA;        return str;&#xA;    }&#xA;    finally&#xA;    {&#xA;        locker.ExitWriteLock();&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;First, let us look at the code that is making use of EnterUpgradeableReadLock:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  public static string Intern(string str)&#xA;{&#xA;    string val;&#xA;    &#xA;    locker.EnterUpgradeableReadLock();&#xA;    try&#xA;    {&#xA;        if(strings.TryGetValue(str, out val))&#xA;            return val;&#xA;            &#xA;        locker.EnterWriteLock();&#xA;        try&#xA;        {&#xA;            strings.Add(str,str);&#xA;        }&#xA;        finally&#xA;        {&#xA;            locker.ExitWriteLock();&#xA;        }&#xA;        return str;&#xA;    }&#xA;    finally&#xA;    {&#xA;        locker.ExitUpgradeableReadLock();&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;And, well, it is somewhat simpler, I&#x2019;ll admit. &#xA;&#xA;The reason that Upgradable Read was introduce is that in the 2.0 ReaderWriterLock, there was a lot of confusion about how you upgrade from read lock to write lock. Essentially, the upgrade process would give up the lock, allowing other threads to sneak in. The Upgradable Read is an explicit way to handle that, since it doesn&#x2019;t free the lock when you upgrade.&#xA;&#xA;But there is one huge problem with this code. Only one thread is able to enter upgradable read lock. That means that in code such as this, where this is the only access that we have, we have in effect turned the reader writer lock into a single write lock. Since only one thread can enter upgradable read, it means that we might have well used a standard lock(syncLock) statement.&#xA;&#xA;My original code is slightly more complex, since it has to check the presence of the value twice, but it also have far more parallelism, since multiple threads can read from the strings table at the same time, which is not possible in the Upgradable Read mode.&#xA;&#xA;Upgradable Read is only useful if you have multiple ways of accessing the data, some that are purely read and some (rare) that are upgradable reads. If most / all of your calls go through upgradable read code paths, you are better off using read/write and handling the lock release explicitly.</p>
