            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just had left work with a potential big issue left open (big defined as - &quot;we may need to re-write the entire UI layer&quot;), I was very pissed off, to say the least. I had a problem with the ASP.Net Session not working in Ajax call back. I just made a significant architecture change that require that I would store some information in the ASP.Net session, and I didn&#x27;t feel like having to either re-write it or the UI layer. Googling wasn&#x27;t really helpful, which only made me angier. At that point, I got sick of it and went home, thinking very bad thoughts about some @#$#@%%. On the ride home, I suddenly had the answer. The issue was only happening when I made a CascadingDropDown call to the server, everything else was behaving normally. CascadingDropDown is using a WebService to get the data from the server. Now I can&#x27;t think of a good reason that a Web Service should have an ASP.Net session by default. The moment I knew what the underlying problem was, it was seconds to find what the solution was, until then, it was nearly impossible.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Chris Holmes&#xA0;commented on my thinking for tools, but I think that he missed a crucial distinction that I made (but not clear enough). If you require a tool in order to work effectively with something, this is an issue. By requiring a tool I mean something beyond VS &#x2B; R#, which are the bare minimum stuff that you need to be effective in C# (it does says something on C#, doesn&#x27;t it?). The Entity Framework Designer is a good example for something where I think that the dependence on the tools indicate a problem. I have been corrected about requiring the SCSF to work effectively with the CAB, which was good to hear.  Tools can make you more effective, but I think that you should always learn without them. Case in point, I am currently teaching people about .Net (I&#x27;ll have a seperate post about it soon, I promise) and teaching them stuff like NHibernate or Active Record would be actively harmful for them at this stage, when they don&#x27;t understand the basics of ADO.Net completely yet. In my opinion, it is always a good idea to know what the tool is doing, why, and where its shortcomings are. Oh, and about the program in notepad thing, I don&#x27;t program C# in notepad (usually), but I have written fully fledged applications in Boo from notepad and the command line. Boo makes it easy &amp; painless to do so, and it is a pleasure (and painless)&#xA0;to work with it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Probably the best part at being in DevTeach&#xA0;was meeting and talking with a lot of people. That was also the biggest frustration. The moment that there were more than three of us, the discussion split into several interesting avenues, leaving me really wishing that I could take part in at least three conversations at once. I can (usually) take part in two discussions at once, but it is confusing (both for me and participant in the discussions), and there is some prioritzation that is going on which decide who I am most interested in listening to right now. Part of the reason that I like email for communication over IM/Voice in many cases is that it allows me to handle concurrent discussions better. That said, there is nothing better to communicate ideas than a face to face meeting where you can easily interact with the person(s) you are talking to. A lot of the discussions that we had at DevTeach would be simply impossible to take to a written form and keep the same tone (which is what made it interesting in the first place.)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the comments to my OR/M Smackdown post&#xA0;Adam Tybor noted: &#xA0; Don&#x27;t we all know that performance is the thing you tweak last?  To which Ted Neward has replied: Well, if you don&#x27;t think about perf until the very end of the project, you usually find yourself having to either just shrug your shoulders and say, &quot;Well, faster hardware will make it run fast&quot;, or backtrack and refactor significant chunks of the application in order to cut out round trips from the system as a whole.  Which reminds me of a conversation that I had with Udi Dahan recently, which we concluded with this great quote from him: In order to design performance domain models, you need to know the kinds of data volumes you&#x2019;re dealing with. It affects both internals and the API of the model &#x2013; when can you assume cascade, and when not. It&#x2019;s important to make these kinds of things explicit in the Domain Model&#x2019;s API. All of which brings me to the following conclusion,&#xA0;performance tuning in the microseconds is a waste of time until you have profiling data in place, but that doesn&#x27;t meant that you should think about performance from the get go. You can code your way out of a lot of things, but an archtiecture that is inherently slow (for instance, chatty on the network) is going to be very hard to modify later on.  Udi had an example of a Customer that has millions of orders, in this case, the performance consideration has a direct affect on the domain model (Yes, I know about filters). From a desing perspective,&#xA0;it basically means that the entity contains too much data and need to be broken. From a performance perspective, that is making it explicit that a potentially very costly call is made (and obviously filtered for the need). A good rule of the thumb for performance is that you should consider an order of magnitude increase in the number of users/transactions before you need to consider a significant change in the archtiecture of the application. That is absolutely not to say that you should consider everything in advance, and I had my greatest performance success by simply batching a few thousands remote calls into a single one, but architecutre matters, and that should be considered in advance, and built accordingly. (And no, it doesn&#x27;t necessiate a Big Architecture Up Front either, although where I would need to scale very high I would spent a while thinking about the way I am going to build the app in advance. Probably with some IT/DBA/Network guys as well, to get a good overview. Oh, nevertheless, premature optimization...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Ted Neward responded to the comments in my post about the OR/M Smackdown.  A few of the comments to my post had an unpleasant tinge to them with regard to Ted, and after listening (just today!) to the podcast, I have to say that I disagree with them.  I think that the debate took an unforeseen approach (which may have made it less exciting to listen to) in that it didn&#x27;t rehash all the old OR/M vs. SP debates*, but instead focused on stuff (that at least to me) that is not really discussed much. As a result, much of the discussion focused on points of failure for each approach in most applications.  I think that such a discussion cannot really be settled to one side or the other, especially since it looks like the major differences between Ted an me is where we would draw the line in where to move from one approach to the other. There is a big difference there, but it is a matter of a value judgement, more than anything.  As someone who is deeply involved with OR/M, it was interesting to hear about the approaches from db4o&#xA0;and the other 2nd generation OODBS, even though I still have my doubts about such systems. You can check here for some of the details. I would be interested in learning how versioning, refactoring, deployment, scaling, optimization, etc applies to an OODBS project, but I am already slicing time to minutes, I don&#x27;t really have the time to do more. (If you are interested in hiring my company for a project that uses an OODB system, taking into account that I have 0 experiance with them, I would be delighted to here about it :-) ).  When I listened to the podcast today, I kept think ,&quot;Oh, I wish that I said XYZ&quot;, and then I listened to myself saying something to that affect. Overall, I am very pleased with the &quot;smackdown&quot;, although it may have been less of&#xA0;&#xA0;a smackdown than anticipated.  A few things about what I have to term &quot;logistics&quot; because I can find no better words for it. I don&#x27;t like how I sound when I speak English, I think much clearer than I can speak, and I am sorry for all those whom I subjected to my English. Both Ted and I have interrupted each other when we had something that had to be said, but Ted sounds so much smoother when he does it... I can understand (although I disagree) why it was thought that he tried to highjack the conversation.  As Ted mentioned, barely an hour before that, I was reminded that gesturing with the hand that holds the mike is not very productive for good sound quality, I listened to that advice, switched hand, and immediately started gesturing with that hand. I probably need more experience there as well.  To conclude, I had great time participating in the debate, and I would like to thanks Carl&#xA0;&amp; Richard for supplying us with the chance to make it.  P.S: And for those who wanted solid truths, I have the consultant answer to you: It Depends.  P.S.S: I have seen the object models that Ted talks about them, that make my 31,438 tables DB looks almost (but not quite) ordinary.  * Sorry Ken, ain&#x27;t going to bite this one again.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It only took solving something I was dreading of dealing with, with a much easier approach that I believed possible. The problem right now is convincing myself that I don&#x27;t really want to finish this feature right now. I can&#x27;t believe how well success can turn a day that was to be rotten.    Anyway, I am off for home now.    I need help preventing the hero syndrome, anyone?</p>
