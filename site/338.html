        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">With the public release of RavenDB 2.5, we want to hear a lot more from users about what they are doing with RavenDB. Therefor, we decided to have a contest. Basically, we would ask you to write a post about your RavenDB experience on the RavenDB page in Facebook. We will send a free RavenDB care package (which includes an awesome T-Shirt &amp; laptop stickers) to the first 50 people to send us their stories. We will also raffle 3 RavenDB DVDs from those who will submit their stories. The contest will end on Sep 20.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">About six weeks ago, we actually released RavenDB 2.5 to the world. It was build 2666. I decided to do something a bit different, and do a silent launch. In other words, We released it, let the people in the mailing list know about it, but we didn&#x2019;t make a big fuss about it. Now we have a new build, 2700 (which isn&#x2019;t going to evoke&#x2026; certain issues for some people), and we want to make as much noise as possible. Because RavenDB 2.5 is out, and it is really cool. Here are some of the new stuff:  Dynamic Reporting Result Transformers Scripted Index Results Unbounded Streams support MSI Installer Index directly to memory Smarter query optimizer Idle indexes, index priorities and locked indexes And that is just a taste. In fact, we are going to do a Webinar about how cool RavenDB 2.5 is on Monday. You can register using the following link: https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/551636514 And, of course, go and get the latest RavenDB from our site.   And have a great New Year, everyone. We will be off for the Holiday until next Monday&#x2026;h</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the steps that we take before releasing a stable is to push the latest build into our own production servers, and see what goes on. By far, this has been a pretty pleasant process, and mostly served to increase our confidence that we can go to production with that version. But sometimes it does what it is supposed to do and find the sort of bugs that are very hard to run in production. In this case, after several hours (8 &#x2013; 12, I am guessing), we discovered that we would start getting errors such as EsentOutOfSessionsException on some of our sites. Esent sessions are the main way we access Esent, and we are pretty careful about managing them. Previously, there wasn&#x2019;t really any way that you could get this error, indeed, that is pretty much the first time we saw that outside of the lab. The difference in 2.5 is that we allowed detached sessions to be used along with DTC calls. This gave us the ability to have a commit pending between the Prepare &amp; Commit phases of the operation. Reviewing the code, I found some places where we weren&#x2019;t properly disposing the sessions, which could explain that. So I fixed that and pushed a new version out. It took a bit longer this time, but the same error happened.&#xA0;  The good thing about having this happen on our production servers is that I have full access there. Of course, it is production, so outright debugging it out, but taking a dump and transferring that to my machine was easy enough. Now, open it with WinDBG, run &#x201C;.loadby sos clr&#x201D; and start investigating. First command, as always, is !threads. And there I could see several threads marked with Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.EsentOutOfSessionsException. That was interesting, and said that we caught the problem as it was happening, which was great. Next, it was time to look a bit at the actual memory. I run: !DumpHeap -type Session  My reaction is Huh!!! There is absolutely zero justification for that. Now, the only question is why. So I decided to look at the class that is holding the transaction state, assuming that this is probably what is holding into all those sessions. I run: !DumpHeap -type EsentTransactionContext  And that tells me quite a lot. There appear to be now a total of 317 in flight DTC transactions. Considering that I know what our usage is, that is a huge number. And it tells me that something isn&#x2019;t right here. This is especially true when you consider that we don&#x2019;t have that many open databases holding in flight transactions: !DumpHeap -type EsentInFlightTransactionalState &#x2013;stat  In other words, we have 8 loaded dbs, each of them holding their in flight transactional state. And we have 317 opened transactions and 35 thousands sessions. That is pretty ridiculous. Especially given that I know that we are supposed to have a max of single digits concurrent DTC transactions at any one time. So somehow we are leaking transactions &amp; sessions. But I am still very unhappy with just &#x201C;we are leaking sessions&#x201D;. That is something that I knew before we start debugging everything. I can already tell that we probably need to add a more robust way of expiring transactions, and I added that, but the numbers don&#x2019;t add up to me. Since this is pretty much all I can do with WinDBG, I decided to use another tool, MemProfiler. This gives me the ability to import the dump file, and then analyze that in a much nicer manner. Doing so, I quickly found this out:  Huh?!  Sessions are finalizable, sure, but I am very careful about making sure to dispose of them. Especially after the previous code change. There should be just 317 undisposed sessions. And having that many items in the finalizer queue can certainly explain things. But I don&#x2019;t know how they got there. And the numbers don&#x2019;t match us, either. We are missing about 7K items from the WinDBG numbers. Okay, next, I pulled ClrMD and wrote the following:      1: var dt = DataTarget.LoadCrashDump(@&quot;C:\Users\Ayende\Downloads\w3wp\w3wp.dmp&quot;);   2: var moduleInfo = dt.ClrVersions[0].TryGetDacLocation();   3: var rt = dt.CreateRuntime(moduleInfo);   4:&#xA0;    5: var clrHeap = rt.GetHeap();   6:&#xA0;    7: var finalized = new HashSet&lt;ulong&gt;();   8:&#xA0;    9: int cnt = 0;  10: foreach (var ptr in rt.EnumerateFinalizerQueue())  11: {  12:     var type = clrHeap.GetObjectType(ptr);  13:     if (type.Name == &quot;Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.Session&quot;)  14:     {  15:         finalized.Add(ptr);  16:     }  17: }  18: Console.WriteLine(finalized.Count);  19:&#xA0;   20: var live = new HashSet&lt;ulong&gt;();  21: foreach (var ptr in clrHeap.EnumerateObjects())  22: {  23:     var type = clrHeap.GetObjectType(ptr);  24:     if (type.Name == &quot;Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.Session&quot;)  25:     {  26:         if (finalized.Contains(ptr) == false)  27:             live.Add(ptr);  28:     }  29: }  30: Console.WriteLine(live.Count);&#xA;This gave me 28,112 sessions in the finalizer queue and 7,547 session that are still live. So something is creating a lot of instances, but not using or referencing them?&#xA;I did a code review over everything once again, and I think that I got it. The culprit is this guy:&#xA;&#xA;Where createContext is defined as:&#xA;&#xA;Now, what I think is going on is that the concurrent dictionary, which is what transactionContexts might be calling the createContext multiple times inside the GetOrAdd method. But because those create values that have to be disposed&#x2026;&#xA0; Now, in the normal course of things, worst case scenario is that we would have them in the finalizer queue and they would be disposed in due time. However, under load, we actually gather quite a few of them, and we run out of available sessions to operate with.&#xA;At least ,this is my current theory. I changed the code to be like this:&#xA;&#xA;So if my value wasn&#x2019;t created, I&#x2019;ll properly dispose of it. I&#x2019;ll be pushing this to production in a bit and seeing what is happening. Note that there aren&#x2019;t locking, but we might be generating multiple sessions. That is fine, as long as only one of them survives.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Another thing that is pretty common in development cycles is the notion of who can do more. Hours, that is, rather than work. That is a pretty important distinction. In general, I appreciate Work much better than Hours. For the simple reason that someone doing 12 hours a day in the office usually do a lot less actual work. Sprints are possible, and we do that sometimes, usually if there is a major production issue or we are gearing up for a release. Then again, we have just released RavenDB 2.5, and we haven&#x2019;t had the need for doing that. It was simpler &amp; easiest to push the date by a week than do long hours just to hit an arbitrary point in time. I think that in the last six months, we had people stay in the office past 5 &#x2013; 6 PM twice.  There are three reasons for that. The two obvious ones are:  people doing 12 &#x2013; 18 hours of work each day turn do crappy stuff, so that is bad for the product. people doing 12 &#x2013; 18 hours of work each day also tend to have&#x2026; issues. They burn out, quite rapidly, too. Leaving aside issues such as this one. People crash and burn. I know that I said it before, but it is important to note. Burn out will do nasty things to you. Leaving aside the proven physical and mental health issues that this cause, it boils down to this. I&#x2019;ve burned out before, it sucks. Let&#x2019;s us not do that is a pretty important aspect of what I do on a daily basis. That is why I turned to building products, because being on the road 60% of the time isn&#x2019;t sustainable, and if it is something that I feel, this is certain for other people who work for Hibernating Rhinos. But I said that there are three reasons. And the third might be just as important as the others. Hibernating Rhinos was built to be a place where people retire from. This is the ideal, and we are probably talking 40 years from now, considering all factors, but that is the idea. We aren&#x2019;t a startup, chasing the pot of gold for that one in a hundred chance to make it rich. And that is why I had to kick people out of the office and tell them to continue working on that issue tomorrow.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In 2009, I decided to make a pretty big move. I decided to take RavenDB and turn that from a side project into a real product. That was something that I actually had a lot of trouble with. Unlike the profiler suite, which is a developer tool, and has a relatively short time to purchase, building a database was something that I knew was going to be a lot more complex in terms of just getting sales. Unlike a developer tool, which is a pretty low risk investment, a database is something that is pretty significant, and that means that it would take time to settle into the market, and even if a user starts developing with RavenDB, it is usually 3 &#x2013; 6 months minimum just to get to the part where they order the license. Add that to the cost of brining a new product to market, and&#x2026; Anyway, it wasn&#x2019;t an easy decision. Today I was looking at some reports when I noticed something interesting. The following is the breakdown of our product based revenue since the first sale of NHibernate Profiler. Note that there is no doubt that NH Prof is a really good product for us. But it is actually pretty awesome that RavenDB is at second place.   This is especially significant in that the profilers has several years of lead time in the market over RavenDB. In fact, running the numbers, until 2011, we sold precious few licenses of RavenDB. In fact, here are the sales numbers for the past few years:  Obviously, the numbers for 2013 are still not complete, but we have already more than surpassed 2012, and we still have a full quarter to go. For that matter, looking at the number just for 2013, we see:        So NH Prof is still a very major product, but RavenDB is now our top performing product for 2013, which makes me a whole lot better. Of course, it also means that we probably need to get rid of a few other products, in particular, LLBLGen, Linq to Sql and Hibernate profilers don&#x2019;t look like they are worth the trouble to keep them going. But that is a matter for another time.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A while ago I got a comment to a post of mine &#x201C;if you [ in here the commenter is talking to another commenter ] think good code does need comments you are obviously unqualified to be in this conversation&#x201D;. And I wanted to demonstrate that this is a very false statement. Let us look at the following piece of code.      1: private long GetNewLength(long current)   2: {   3:     DateTime now = DateTime.UtcNow;   4:     TimeSpan timeSinceLastIncrease = (now - _lastIncrease);   5:     if (timeSinceLastIncrease.TotalSeconds &lt; 30)   6:     {   7:         _increaseSize = Math.Min(_increaseSize * 2, MaxIncreaseSize);   8:     }   9:     else if (timeSinceLastIncrease.TotalMinutes &gt; 2)  10:     {  11:         _increaseSize = Math.Max(MinIncreaseSize, _increaseSize / 2);  12:     }  13:     _lastIncrease = DateTime.UtcNow;  14:     current = Math.Max(current, 256 * PageSize);  15:     var actualIncrease = Math.Min(_increaseSize, current / 4);  16:     return current &#x2B; actualIncrease;  17: }&#xA;This piece of code is responsible for decided the new file size when we run out of room in the current space we use.&#xA;That is 10 lines of code. And what happens is quite clear, even if I say so myself. But the why for this code is lost. In particular, there is a lot of reasoning behind the actual logic here. You can see that we play with the actual increase size, to make sure that if we increase often, we will reserve more space from the OS. That seems clear enough, but what about lines 14 &#x2013; 15?&#xA;In this case, just before those two lines we have:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: // At any rate, we won&#x27;t do an increase by over 25% of current size, to prevent huge empty spaces   2: // and the first size we allocate is 256 pages (1MB)   3: //    4: // The reasoning behind this is that we want to make sure that we increase in size very slowly at first   5: // because users tend to be sensitive to a lot of &quot;wasted&quot; space.    6: // We also consider the fact that small increases in small files would probably result in cheaper costs, and as   7: // the file size increases, we will reserve more &amp; more from the OS.   8: // This also plays avoids &quot;I added 300 records and the file size is 64MB&quot; problems that occur when we are too   9: // eager to reserve space  10:&#xA0; &#xA;And yes, this isn&#x2019;t about comments such as // increment by 1. I try writing comments like that when explaining policy or heuristics. Or when I am doing something pretty funky all around for some (hopefully) good reason.&#xA;Another example might be this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: // here we try to optimize the amount of work we do, we will only    2: // flush the actual dirty pages, and we will do so in sequential order   3: // ideally, this will save the OS the trouble of actually having to flush the    4: // entire range   5: long start = sortedPagesToFlush[0];   6: long count = 1;   7: for (int i = 1; i &lt; sortedPagesToFlush.Count; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)   8: {   9:     var difference = sortedPagesToFlush[i] - sortedPagesToFlush[i - 1];  10:     // if the difference between them is not _too_ big, we will just merge it into a single call  11:     // we are trying to minimize both the size of the range that we flush AND the number of times  12:     // we call flush, so we need to balance those needs.  13:     if (difference &lt; 64)  14:     {  15:         count &#x2B;= difference;  16:         continue;  17:     }  18:     FlushPages(start, count);  19:     start = sortedPagesToFlush[i];  20:     count = 1;  21: }  22: FlushPages(start, count);&#xA;Again, relatively short code. And really easy to follow. But good luck trying to figure out that this code is responsible for a 100% perf boost, or that you need to balance multiple aspects to get an optimal solution without getting comments.&#xA;Now, I think that when people talk about &#x201C;good code doesn&#x2019;t need comments&#x201D;, they think about code like this (all samples taken from a popular OSS project):&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: var query = _backInStockSubscriptionRepository.Table;   2: //customer   3: query = query.Where(biss =&gt; biss.CustomerId == customerId);   4: //store   5: if (storeId &gt; 0)   6:     query = query.Where(biss =&gt; biss.StoreId == storeId);   7: //product   8: query = query.Where(biss =&gt; !biss.Product.Deleted);   9: query = query.OrderByDescending(biss =&gt; biss.CreatedOnUtc);&#xA;Yes, I can read, thank you. And here is an example of two comments, the first one good, and the second bad:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: if (_commonSettings.UseStoredProceduresIfSupported &amp;&amp; _dataProvider.StoredProceduredSupported)   2: {   3:     //stored procedures are enabled and supported by the database.    4:     //It&#x27;s much faster than the LINQ implementation below    5:&#xA0;    6:     #region Use stored procedure   7:        8:     //pass category identifiers as comma-delimited string   9:     string commaSeparatedCategoryIds = &quot;&quot;;  10:     if (categoryIds != null)  11:     {  12:         for (int i = 0; i &lt; categoryIds.Count; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;The first comment explain why. And that is crucial. You should only need to explain the how very rarely, and then, you need a comment to justify why you need the comment. (Performance, maybe?)</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that always bugged me when working at a corporate environment was the sheer amount of work you had to do just to be able to do your work.&#xA0; For example, I know of people who purchase our profilers out of their own pocket, because they want to do a better job, but their workplace won&#x2019;t or can&#x2019;t authorize that.  A lot of the time this has to do with the way the business allocate money. They may have a developer budget, but no tools budget, etc. Honestly, I think that this is stupid. And one of the things that I try to do is avoid being stupid. In the end, almost any tool a developer want is going to cost significantly less then the lack of tool.  Hence&#x2026;  Sure, it is a 10$ charge, but we do the same for pretty much every tool requested.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the RavenDB mailing list, we had a question about how we can combine the standard unit of work pattern of working with RavenDB in MVC applications with async. In particular, the problematic code was:      1: public class HomeController : Controller   2: {   3:     public IAsyncDocumentSession Db { get; set; }   4:&#xA0;    5:     public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; Index()   6:     {   7:         var person = new Person {Name = &quot;Khalid Abuhakmeh&quot;};   8:         await Db.StoreAsync(person);   9:&#xA0;   10:         return View(person);  11:     }  12:&#xA0;   13:     protected override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)  14:     {  15:         Db = MvcApplication.DocumentStore.OpenAsyncSession();  16:         base.OnActionExecuting(filterContext);  17:     }  18:&#xA0;   19:     protected override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)  20:     {  21:         Db.SaveChangesAsync()  22:             .ContinueWith(x =&gt; { });  23:&#xA0;   24:         base.OnActionExecuted(filterContext);  25:     }  26:&#xA0;   27:     public class Person  28:     {  29:         public string Id { get; set; }   30:         public string Name { get; set; }  31:     }  32: }&#xA;&#xA;As you probably noticed, the problem is with line 21. We want to execute the save changes in an async manner, but we don&#x2019;t want to do that in a way that would block the thread. The current code just assume the happy path, and any error would be ignored. That ain&#x2019;t right. If we were using Web API, this would be trivially easy, but we aren&#x2019;t. So let us see what can be done about it.&#xA;I created a new MVC 4 application and wrote the following code:&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, I have a break point after the await, which means that when that break point is hit, I&#x2019;ll be able to see what is responsible for handling async calls in MVC4. When the breakpoint was hit, I looked at the call stack, and saw:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Not very useful, right? But we can fix that:&#xA;&#xA;And now we get:&#xA;&#xA;This is a whole bunch of stuff that doesn&#x2019;t really help, I am afraid. But then I thought about putting the breakpoint before the await, which gave me:&#xA;&#xA;And this means that I can check the code here. I got the code and started digging. At first I thought that I couldn&#x2019;t do it, but then I discovered that I could. See, all you have to do is to create you own async action invoker, like so:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: public class UnitOfWorkAsyncActionInvoker : AsyncControllerActionInvoker   2: {   3:     protected override IAsyncResult BeginInvokeActionMethod(   4:         ControllerContext controllerContext,   5:         ActionDescriptor actionDescriptor,   6:         IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt; parameters, AsyncCallback callback,   7:         object state)   8:     {   9:         return base.BeginInvokeActionMethod(controllerContext, actionDescriptor, parameters,  10:                                             result =&gt; DoSomethingAsyncAfterTask().ContinueWith(task =&gt; callback(task)),  11:                                             state);  12:     }  13:&#xA0;   14:     public async Task DoSomethingAsyncAfterTask()  15:     {  16:         await Task.Delay(1000);  17:     }  18: }&#xA;And then register it:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: DependencyResolver.SetResolver(type =&gt;   2:     {   3:         if (type == typeof (IAsyncActionInvoker))   4:             return new UnitOfWorkAsyncActionInvoker();   5:         return null;   6:     }, type =&gt; Enumerable.Empty&lt;object&gt;());&#xA;And you are golden. &#xA;Note: Except for doing a minimum of F5 in the debugger, I have neither tested nor verified this code. It appears to do what I want it to, and since I am only getting to this because a customer asked about this in the mailing list, that is about as much investigation time that I can dedicate to it.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A fairly common question that gets ask is how to maintain identifiers between RavenDB and a secondary system. For this example, we will assume that we have a table in SQL Server that have a list of users. In SQL Server, we use a identity to identify the users. But in RavenDB we want to use different ids (maybe we want to have ids that are created only in RavenDB). That means that we have something like:  As you can see, users 1 &#x2013; 2 map to the same id in the RDBMS system, but users/3 was created in the RavenDB system, and the other users are on different ids. The question now becomes, how do you keep track of that, especially with regards to having updates later on. The easiest way to go about it would be to just keep the RDMBS id in the document, and query on that. That means that you need to query, and that subject to RavenDB BASE queries. So we want to try to do something better. We can just keep a document reference, so we could do something like Load(&#x201C;mapping/3&#x201D;) &#x2013;&gt; &#x201C;users/4&#x201D;. This means that we keep a document with the RDBMS&#xA0; id that just points to the actual user&#x2019;s document. That works, but that isn&#x2019;t very optimal. Mostly because you will need to do a lot of requests (or load a lot of documents) to get that working nicely in bulk scenarios. But that isn&#x2019;t the only option. Instead, you are going to use a document per 1000 ids. That would be called something like: &#x201C;mappings/1-1000&#x201D;, &#x201C;mappings/1001-2000&#x201D;, etc. The idea here is that we can load a single document, and get a thousand mapping all at once. Since we will usually be processing those values in order, this gives us a cheap way to preload stuff.</p>
