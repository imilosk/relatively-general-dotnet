            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m writing this post at a time when Donald Trump&#x2019;s social media accounts were closed by Twitter, Facebook and across pretty much all popular social networks. Parler, an alternative social network has been kicked off the Apple and Google app stores and its AWS account was closed. It also appears that many vendors are dropping it and it will take significant time to get back online, if it is able to do so.I&#x2019;m not interested in talking about the reasons for this, mind. This is a hot topic political issue, in a country I&#x2019;m not a citizen of, and I have no interest in getting bogged down with the political details.I wish I could say that I had no dog in this fight, but I suspect that the current events will have a long term impact on the digital world. Note that all of those actions are taken by private companies, on their own volition. In other words, it isn&#x2019;t a government or the courts demanding this behavior, but the companies&#x2019; own decision making process.The thing that I can&#x2019;t help thinking is that the current behavior by those companies is direct, blatant and very much short sighted. To start with, all of those companies are working on global scale, and they have just proven that they are powerful enough to rein in the President of the Unites States. Sure, he is at a lame duck status currently, but that is still something that upset the balance of power. The problem with that is that while it would appear that the incoming US administration is favorable to this course of action, there are other countries and governments that are looking at this with concern. Poland is on track to pass a law prohibiting the removal of posts in social media that do not break local laws. Israel&#x2019;s parliament is also considering a similar proposal. In both cases, mind, these proposed laws got traction last year, before the current escalation in this behavior. I feel that more governments will now consider such laws in the near future, given the threat level that this represent to them. A politician is this day and age that doesn&#x2019;t use social media to its fullest extent is going to be severely hampered. Both the Obama and the Trump campaigns were lauded for their innovative use of social media, for example. There are also other considerations to ponder. One of the most costly portions of running a social network is the monitoring and filtering of posts. You have to take into account that people will post bile, illegal and obscene stuff. That&#x2019;s expensive, and one of the reasons for vendors dropping of Parler was their moderation policies. That means that there is a big and expensive barrier in place for future social networks that try to grow. I&#x2019;m not sure how this is going to play out in the short term, to be honest. But in the long term, I think that there is going to be a big push, both legally and from a technical perspective to fill those holes. From a legal perspective, I would expect that many lawyers will make a lot of money on the fallout from the current events, just with regards to the banning of Parler.&#xA0; I expect that there are going to be a whole lot of new precedents, both in the USA and globally. From a technical perspective, the technology to run a distributed social network exists. Leave aside currently esoteric choices such as social network on blockchain (there appears to be a lot of them, search for that, wow!), people can fall back to good old Blog &amp; RSS to get quite a bit of traction. It wouldn&#x2019;t take much to something that looks very similar to current social networks.Consider RSS Bandit or Google Reader vs. Twitter or Facebook. There isn&#x2019;t much that you&#x2019;ll need to do to go from aggregation of RSS feeds to a proper social network. One advantage of such a platform, by the way, is that it allows (and encourage) thought processes that are longer than 140 characters. I dearly miss the web of the 2000s, by the way. Longer term, however, I would expect a rise of distributed social networks that are composed of independent but cooperating nodes (yes, I&#x2019;m aware of Mastodon, and I&#x2019;m familiar with Gab breaking out of that). I don&#x2019;t know if this will be based on existing software or if we&#x2019;ll end up with new networks, but I think that the die has been cast in this regard.That means that the next social network will have to operate under assumed hostile environment. That means running on multiple vendors, taking no single point of failure, etc. The biggest issue with getting a social network off the ground is&#x2026; well, network effects. You need enough people in the network before you start getting more bang for the buck. But right now, there is a huge incentive for such a network, given the migration of many users from the established networks. Parler&#x2019;s app has seen hundreds of thousands of downloads a day in the past week, before it was taken down from the app stores. Gab is reporting 10,000&#x2B; new users an hour and more users in the past two days than they had seen in the past two years.There is a hole there that will be filled, I think. Who will be the winner of all those users, I don&#x2019;t know, but I think that this will have a fundamental impact on the digital world.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">On an otherwise uneventful morning, the life of the operations guy got&#x2026; interesting. What were supposed to be a routine morning got hectic because the database refused to operate normally. To be more exact, the database refused to load a file. RavenDB is generally polite when it run into issues, but this time, it wasn&#x2019;t playing around. Here is the error it served:---&gt; System.IO.IOException: Could not set the size of file&#xA0; D:\RavenData\Databases\Purple\Raven.voron to 820 GBytes---&gt; System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (665): The requested operation could not be completed due to a file system limitationGood old ERROR_FILE_SYSTEM_LIMITATION, I never knew you, because we have never run into an error with this in the past. The underlying reason was simple, we had a large file (820GB) that was too fragmented. At some point, the number of fragments of the file bypassed the maximum size of the file system.  The KB article about this issue is here. You might be able to move forward more quickly by using the contig.exe tool to defrag a single file.The root cause here was probably backing up to the same drive as the database, which forced the file system to break the database file into fragements. Just a reminder that there are always more layers into the system and that we need to understand them all when they break.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I want to comment on the following tweet:A rather banal &#x201C;thought experiment:&#x201D;What if the only code we could review was tests and interface definitions?What would that force us to specify at the interface and behaviour level, rather than just the implementation level?&#x2014; Reginald Braithwaite (@raganwald) January 2, 2021 When I read it, I had an immediate and visceral reaction. Because this is one of those things that sound nice, but is actually a horrible dystopian trap. It confused two very important concepts and put them in the wrong order, resulting in utter chaos. The two ideas are &#x201C;writing tests&#x201D; and &#x201C;producing high quality code&#x201D;. And they are usually expressed in something like this:We write tests in order to product high quality code. Proper tests ensure that you can make forward progress without having regressions. They are a tool you use to ensure a certain level of quality as you move forward. If you assume that the target is the tests and that you&#x2019;ll have high quality code because of that, however, you end up in weird places. For example, take a look at the following set of stairs. They aren&#x2019;t going anywhere, and aside from being decorative, serves no purpose.When you start considering tests themselves to be the goal, instead of a means to achieve it, you end up with decorative tests. They add to your budget and make it harder to change things, but don&#x2019;t benefit the project. There are a lot of things that you are looking for in code review that shouldn&#x2019;t be in the tests. For example, consider the error handling strategy for the code. We have an invariant that says that exceptions may no escape our code when running in a background thread. That is because this will kill the process. How would you express something like that in a test? Because you end up with an error raised from a write to a file that happens when the disk is full that kills the server. Another example is a critical piece of code that needs to be safely handle out of memory exceptions. You can test for that, sure, but it is hard and expensive. It also tend to freeze your design and implementation, because you are now testing implementation concerns and that make it very hard to change your code. Reviewing code for performance pitfalls is also another major consideration. How do you police allocations using a test? And do that without killing your productivity? For fun, the following code allocates:Console.WriteLine(1_000_000);There are ways to monitor and track these kind of things, for sure, but they are very badly suited for repeatable tests. Then there are other things that you&#x2019;ll cover in the review, more tangible items. For example, the quality of error messages you raise, or the logging output. I&#x2019;m not saying that you can&#x2019;t write tests for those. I&#x2019;m saying that you shouldn&#x2019;t. That is something that you want to be able to change and modify quickly, because you may realize that you want to add more information in a certain scenario. Freezing the behavior using tests just means that you have more work to do when you need to make the changes. And reviewing just test code is an even bigger problem when you consider that you need to consider interactions between features and their impact on one another. Not in terms of correctness, you absolutely need to test that, but in terms of behavior.The interleaving of internal tasks inside of RavenDB was careful designed to ensure that we&#x2019;ll be biased in favor of user facing operations, starving background operations if needed. At the same time, it means that we need to ensure that we&#x2019;ll give the background tasks time to run. I can&#x2019;t really think about how you would write a test for something like that without basically setting in stone the manner in which we make that determination. That is something that I explicitly don&#x2019;t want to do, it will make changing how and what we do harder. But that is something that I absolutely consider in code reviews.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We got an interesting question a few times in recent weeks. How can I manually create a document revision with RavenDB? The answer for that is that you can use the ForceRevisionCreationFor() method to do so. Here is how you&#x2019;ll typically use this API:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.&#xA;      Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;              Show hidden characters&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          using (var session = store.OpenSession())&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          {&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              var company = new Company { Name = &quot;HR&quot; };&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              session.Store(company);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              session.Advanced.Revisions.ForceRevisionCreationFor(company);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              session.SaveChanges();&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          }&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          force-revisions.cs&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;This is the typical expected usage for the API. We intended this to make it so users can manually triggers revisions, for example, when moving a document from draft mode to public and the like.It turns out that there is another reason to want to use this API, when you migrate data to RavenDB and want to create historical revisions. The API we envisioned isn&#x2019;t suitable for this, but the layered API in RavenDB means that we can still get the desired behavior. Here is how we can achieve this:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Note that RavenDB requires a document to create a revision from it, so we set the document, create a revision and overwrite the document again, as many times as we need to. Another issue that was brought up is that the @last-modified property on the document is set to the date of the revision creation. In some cases, they want to do this to get the revision to be created at the right time it was originally created during the migration period. That is not supported by RavenDB, because the @last-modified is tracking the time that RavenDB modified the document or revision. If you need to track the time a document was modified in the domain, you need to keep that as part of your actual domain model.</p>
