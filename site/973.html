            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x27;m currently doing a big project on .Net 2.0, you might have figured that out because that is about all I talk about lately. I did a short code review for myself recently, and I noticed that I used&#xA0; just about every new feature of C# 2 that came out short of partial classes (and they would be used on the UI).    Of the top of my head, here are the features of C# 2.0 that I love:            Anonymous Delegates - I really hope that whoever it is who is going to maintain my code can wrap his head around it (I know that some people have problems with that), because I use it is cool, fun, and saves a lot of work. I just love it.            Iterators - This is a really cool way to run over an object graph. It&#x27;s really simple on both sides of the code. The one thing I regret is that there is no way to do some sort of lazy sorting, but that is mathematically impossible to do anyway.            Generics - They are cool, save a lot of typing, but not really exciting except in what they                 #pragana warning disable - Very useful to tell the compiler, I know what I&#x27;m doing here. Currently I&#x27;m using it to shut some warnings about unused fields that I&#x27;m setting via reflection.            sealed classes - It&#x27;s good to have an easy way to do it.    Of the top of my head, here are the features of VS 2005 that I love:            Slicker UI            Some refactoring support (but not as good as ReSharper).            Ability to edit / view the database directly from the IDE.    All in all, I&#x27;m not very impressed with all the new abilities of VS 2005. I&#x27;m sure that they demo nicely, and you can probably show me some stuff that will evoke a Wow! out of me in some areas, but I don&#x27;t see the big improvement in the IDE that I expected to. It is very annoying because you can see that they almost got it.    One thing that I really like is the code coverage for unit testing, when you activate that, you can see what parts of the codes were visited. This is a killer feature, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to use that with NUnit, and I can&#x27;t use VS Unit Test framework because that one is totally unsuitable for tests.    There was some discussion today about the pricing for VS 2005, so I headed here to check it out. I think that I (personally) think that&#xA0;I&#x27;ll either goes with VS.Net Standard, since this gives me most of the nice features that I need, at only slightly unreasonable price ($300). The problem with that is that this doesn&#x27;t include MSDN subscription. Getting that means shelling out $ 1,200 which is a lot to me.    So far I have done wonderfully by using a $90 VS 2003 Standard, but I keep hearing about all those new stuff that are avialable to MSDN subscribers only... I think that I could be very happy with C# Express, except for the little fact that it doesn&#x27;t support add ons. I can&#x27;t see myself living without ReSharper and TestDriven.Net.    I&#x27;m currently trying out Sharp Develop 2 (from the subverison repository), and while I think that it&#x27;s a great effort, past experiance shows that it&#x27;s not quite ready for prime time. Even if I would decide to go this way, I would still need ReSharper. Another option altogether is to wait for the JetBrains .Net IDE. Considerring my love for ReSharper, I may even save some money on this one.    Any suggestions from people who already made this decision?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">What do you think about a base class that doesn&#x2019;t&#xA;offer any business value to an object, but provide services? By that I mean a&#xA;base class that takes care of persistence, validation, etc. &#xA;&#xA;I just run into a situation where I&#x2019;ve such a class, but&#xA;I don&#x2019;t want some of my classes to use it. The problem is that this&#xA;happens in the middle of the hierarchy. Here is the scenario:&#xA;&#xA;- Rule &#x2013; Persisted to database&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;- Built-in Rule &#x2013; Not persisted to database&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;- Lots of Rules &#x2013; Persisted to database&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;Rule inherits from a base class that handles the persistence.&#xA;Most of the rules are persisted, but the built in ones always exist. What I needed was a way to do multiply&#xA;inheritance, so I could have this hierarchy:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;- Rule &#x2013; Not persisted, provide common interface and&#xA;services&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;- Built-in Rules &#x2013; Not persisted.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;- Persisted Rule &#x2013; Inherits from Rule and the persistence&#xA;class&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;- Lots of rules&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;You can&#x2019;t do that in .Net (which is a shame).&#xA;&#xA;Right now I&#x2019;ve a situation where a built in rule looks like it can be persisted, which I&#xA;don&#x2019;t want to happen. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After a very long time (or so it seems), I&#x27;m done reading&#xA0; Patterns of Enterprise Applications&#xA0;:-)    I already talked about why I found it interesting. Highly recommended, although it would blow your mind if you read it too quickly.    I&#x27;m going through my Amazon orders history, and I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of books I read in the last year. I blogged about most of them, but the amount is really big when you look at it all together. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve books from 2004 (december, though) that I&#x27;ve yet to read. I had PoEA since January 2005, but I got to reading it only now.    Here is a list of what I still has to read:    High priority books:            Data Access Patterns: Database Interactions in Object-Oriented Applications                 I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll get from this book, as I&#x27;m completely ORM guy now. But nothing that has to do with data is ever going to waste :-) Another book that I&#x27;ve for a long time.            The Design of Everyday Things&#xA0;and Emotional Design&#xA0;are two books about designing physical objects, but they come highly recommended for anyone who needs to do UI and needs to understand more than just the surface.            Peopleware : Productive Projects and Teams, 2nd Ed.                A book about process and management, one of the books that everybody recommends.            AntiPatterns: Refactoring Software, Architectures, and Projects in Crisis                 Partly for the horror factor, partly to preper to battle those monsters.            Best Kept Secrets in .NET                Full of tricks, some of which I already know, some of which I don&#x27;t care to know (all the dataset stuff), and some I probably need to know :-)    Books I&#x27;ve started reading but didn&#x27;t finish:            UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language, Third Edition                I usually devour any of Fowler&#x27;s books, but I just couldn&#x27;t find enough interest to keep reading this one. It&#x27;s all about boxes and arrows and what a full arrowhead is compared to an empty arrowhead. Perhaps it is because I never had to write any UML and any time I tried it was highly frustrating... ?            Virtual Machine Design and Implementation in C/C&#x2B;&#x2B;                This one I&#x27;ve since 2002, I think. It&#x27;s a good book, and it certainly delivers what it promises... But the book is about a very simple virtual machine implemented in C&#x2B;&#x2B; that I could see nothing special with. It certainly cleared my mind about a lot of stuff, but I still think that a great opportunity was missed here. I would be more interested in reading it if it dealt with issues such as garbage collection, JIT, etc. Instead, it&#x27;s just an assembly language and a virtual CPU.            Understanding the LINUX Kernel: From I/O Ports to Process Management                I read half way&#xA0;into this book until I got bored with following low level C code. It&#x27;s not hopelessly out of date.            Beginning Direct3D Game Programming and Beginning .NET Game Programming in C#                My mind just can&#x27;t wrap itself around 3D math right now. I fully intend to get back to it when I can actually understand what they are talking about.            Enterprise Solution Patterns Using Microsoft .Net: Version 2.0 : Patterns &amp; Practices                Can you say boring. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to read this to the end. It&#x27;s a bunch of stuff that I read elsewhere, mostly presented in a very boring way.            Build Your Own .NET Language and Compiler                This book has the privilage of being the only one I put down on account of code style. It&#x27;s a VB.Net book (and I&#x27;m a C# guy, if you didn&#x27;t notice), but that wasn&#x27;t what made me put it away. It was hungarian notation in VB.Net in 2004! It was very bad code and totally lame implementation of the compiler. Yuck!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note: This is an online report, which means that I&#x27;m writing this post as I&#x27;m upgrading.    I downloaded the binary distribution edited the web.config to point at my database and then copied the directory to the server, overwriting everything there.    In retrospect, I&#x27;m not sure this is very wise, since I can&#x27;t remember how I change the default look and feel of Cuyahoga. OTOH, I have it on a backup, so that is not a big issue.    I&#x27;m copying via SmartFTP&#x27;s threaded queue. One thing to notice there is that there seem to be be problems if you try for really high number of threads (25 and above). The problem doesn&#x27;t seem to be in SmartFTP itself, but on the server, and it&#x27;s related to locked files. I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong there, but I&#x27;m currently using 10 threads to upload, and it seems to be working fine.    This version of Cuyahoga should offer some performance gains (mainly because of the upgraded version of NHibernate) and fixes some problems with regard to over-eager caching.    Hm, it looks like SmartFTP&#xA0;didn&#x27;t copy the Bin directory. That is strange, I&#x27;ll copy it manually.    Okay, that worked, and I got the nice installer that upgraded my database. I still got some problems with regard to the positioning, it was a bug in Cuyahoga 0.8.2, which I think has to do with deleting sections, but it should be fixed now. It doesn&#x27;t automatically fix the problem, though, and I had to go and fix that manually.    There wasn&#x27;t any problem with my layout, seems that I created a new template instead of overwriting an existing one. The one problem I&#x27;d is overwriting the orange RSS image with a blue one, and that took a second to fix.    I needed to upgrade the downloads module manually. There used to be a bug where downloads would sometimes freeze midway, I hope that is fixed.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Damn! But Knife of Dreams&#xA0;is a fine book!     I read it in one sitting, of course, after waiting so long for it, I just couldn&#x27;t bear to do it by halves. It&#x27;s everything&#xA0;the Wheel Of Time fans could hope for.     There is a lot of action. Things that were building for the last three or four books are finally coming into light. The entire book is very fast paced, and it managed to close a lot of plot lines. It&#x27;s an amazing book, I just couldn&#x27;t put it down.     I don&#x27;t want to spoil the surprise for anyone who hadn&#x27;t read it yet, so I&#x27;ll just say these things:             Plot lines from previous books are closed left, right and center.                 I can&#x27;t off hand think of any big plot that started in this book.                 Things that were setup years and years ago finally come to fruitation.                 The characters actually explain some of the things that they are doing. It was a constant annoyance in previous books, where you would see a character behave in a completely unlogical way, and you sometimes couldn&#x27;t figure out why.                 The Last Battle is Close - and RJ said that there is only one more book!                 There is a lot and lot and lot of action.                 No more setup!         This is the impression after reading it once, I&#x27;m going to read it a few more times, probably.     Well, I&#x27;m now off to read the newsgroup, I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t give in and read the spoilers.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m&#xA;having fun using Fitnesse to test my code,&#xA;but I just got an exception from the bottom of the stack on one of my Fit&#xA;tests, and I started to think about just how many layers I&#x2019;m using there.&#xA;In order to be able to complete the tests I want to write (business logic only,&#xA;mainly), I&#x2019;m going to:&#xA;&#xA;&#xB7;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA;Create a set of&#xA;fixtures to translate from Fit tables to my model.&#xA;&#xA;&#xB7;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA;Create an&#xA;abstraction on top of Fit that make it looks like the database it used.&#xA;&#xA;&#xB7;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA;Mock several parts&#xA;of the implementation for the Fit tests (parts that I don&#x2019;t really&#xA;control).&#xA;&#xA;&#xB7;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA;Mock the database&#xA;layer for ActiveRecord..&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;With so many levels of indirection, I&#x2019;m afraid that I&#x2019;ll&#xA;tests my mocking, and not the business objects J&#xA;&#xA;I started to mock the database, but I soon lost myself in&#xA;the details. I think that for now I&#x2019;m going to just use the database&#xA;(after all, Fit is supposed to be&#xA;all about acceptance tests.) &#xA;&#xA;One more thing to consider if you&#x2019;re going to use&#xA;Fitnesse for your tests, learn to love the Debugger.Break(),&#xA;it will helps you out of situations you can&#x2019;t understand how you&#x2019;ve&#xA;gotten yourself into. One word of warning, most of the documentation for Fit&#xA;and Fitnesse is about the Java version, and the .Net version lacks some&#xA;abilities that would make working with it much easier. Specifically, I&#x2019;m talking&#xA;about the FitLibrary for .Net.&#xA;&#xA;I&#x2019;ve been able to create a fixture that would be Good&#xA;Enough &#x2122; for my needs, so it wasn&#x2019;t that much of a problem for me.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m&#xA;currently reading Fowler&#x2019;s Patterns&#xA;of Enterprise Applications, and I&#x2019;m very slightly bored. Not because&#xA;of Fowler&#x2019;s writing, of course. It&#x2019;s just that he doesn&#x2019;t&#xA;seem to talk about new concepts for me. When I read his Refactoring book, I was&#xA;thrilled; there was a lot of new stuff to learn. But reading PoEA&#xA;is a different matter. I don&#x2019;t learn many new stuff, but rather I see&#xA;more clearly what is going on in the tools that I&#x2019;m using.&#xA;&#xA;When he talks about Active Record, I get better understanding&#xA;of the advantages &amp; disadvantages of using Castle.ActiveRecord.&#xA;When he talks about Unit Of Work and Data Mappers, I suddenly see why NHibernate is doing this or that, and I&#xA;can see ways I can take advantage of it. I&#x2019;m currently reading about MVC&#xA;in web applications and about Page Controller vs. Front Controller and I keep&#xA;thinking about MonoRail and the way it does things. The problem of Template&#xA;View vs. Transform View vs. Two Step View came up in the Castle developers&#xA;lists twice in the last month.&#xA;&#xA;I can&#x2019;t wait to get to the parts where I don&#x2019;t know anything (Optimistic&#xA;Offline Lock, for instance). Great book. It&#x2019;s clearing a lot of design decisions&#xA;for me. It&#x2019;s surprising how much of the things he talks about are&#xA;implemented in Open Source Software that makes the patterns accessible for&#xA;anyone. &#xA;&#xA;One thing that surprised me is that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be&#xA;any discussion of security in any way inside the book. I&#x2019;m pretty sure&#xA;that there are patterns for securing code beyond not using strcpy(), any one&#xA;can recommend something?&#xA;&#xA;I shuffled through Writing&#xA;Secure Code, and it&#x2019;s mainly talks about low level things, highly&#xA;important, yes, but not very helpful when you&#x2019;re trying to design your&#xA;application security. I&#x2019;ve the first version, so maybe the second version&#xA;fixes that.&#xA;&#xA;Anyone has a recommendation?</p>
