I looked at the CV (and oh my God, did this guy have a lot of acronyms in there). I noted that he has a GitHub account in the CV, so naturally I checked it.There is a single repository there, which I&#x2019;ll present to you in all its glory:This is actually a negative. If he didn&#x2019;t have a GitHub account, I wouldn&#x2019;t have minded. But including one that is in this shape is not a good idea.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Part of the job of a product owner is to pay attention to the list of issues in the issue tracker. Not just to get a feeling for the cadence of the project, but to have an impact on its direction.Paying attention to the issues doesn&#x2019;t mean just tracking down what bugs are still opened, mind. Consider the case of a product owner with the release due date looming over the horizon, you need to start looking at the list of remaining issues and take active steps to make sure that you are going to get done more or less on time.The usual rules apply, chose any 2 of:SpeedQuantityQualityIn other words, your team can deliver more features in time, if you are willing to sacrifice quality. On the other hand, they can keep high quality and the same number of features, but the due date will have to move. As an aside, it is possible to get all three of these aspects at once, but only for a very short amount of time (few days to a week or two at most), but at a very high long term cost.One of the things that I observed is that in some cases, a lot of complexity and work is in the last 2% of work, where all the the polish work and rough edge cases lurks. In some respects, this is actually a really good thing. Because it gives the product owner the chance to remove features that won&#x2019;t usually have an explicit impact on the users.&#xA0; A good example for this in RavenDB would be the amount of time and effort we put into the intellisense feature of RQL queries in the studio. That falls under the Nice To Have set of features. It is unlikely that we&#x2019;ll get many upset users if the intellisense isn&#x2019;t up to part with something like Visual Studio or ReSharper, so beyond getting some basic functionality right, we can defer improvements there if we don&#x2019;t have the extra capacity to complete this by the expected date.I&#x2019;m sure that you can think of other examples in your own projects. Note that this require you to understand what exactly your users are valuing your software for. In the case of RavenDB, adding more query functionality and speeding up overall system performance ranks much higher than adding extra smarts to intellisense that is mostly used during exploration / demos. On the other hand, the effect of the pushing such features down the road accumulate over time. In other words, if you keep your priorities straight and select which features should go into the product, you will defer the small fries over and over. At some point, you&#x2019;ll need to make a decision about them. You can either decide that they don&#x2019;t make sense anymore or they are never really going to be important enough to actually put in the &#x201C;let&#x2019;s get this done&#x201D; queue. Alternatively, you might want to put them in the idle bin. In other words, whenever you have an idle portion in your development, you can peek into the idle bin and get some tasks from there. That is also a good place to have a new team member start from. These are tasks that are minor and not that important, after all, so they can use that to learn the codebase. In fact, we have used this in the past as the tasks bin for interns. That is usually a really good fit, for the same reason that they are good tasks for a new team member with the added benefits that they are usually well scoped and if the intern messes up, you didn&#x2019;t lose too much.Regardless, the idle bin notion is important, because otherwise your future tasks queue is going to grow larger and larger, and it will be ever harder to figure out what tasks actually matter.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Imagine that you are the owner of Gary&#x2019;s Shoes, and that you want to get data from all of your multitudes of stores into a centralized location. You&#x2019;ll use that data to make decisions, predict future trends, etc. Given that each store must operate independently, you have a server in each location that will push up it changes (and get updates from) the HQ cluster. You can see an example of this kind of setup in this post. This work quite well, but it does require the user to be aware of a potential issue. When you have a massively distributed data flow process setup, you need to also pay attention for the quite in the noise. What do I mean by that?One of our customers have RavenDB deployed to tens of thousands of locations worldwide. At any given time, you are going to have at least some of those locations unavailable. In some locations, part of closing down for the day means literally flipping the master switch on electricity for the entire building. On others, you might have someone tripping over the router or have some local or regional network outage. Part of the strategy for dealing with such a data set, coming from so many separate locations, is the need to monitor when we aren&#x2019;t getting data. The fact that on most of our locations we have near real time data is very powerful for the business. But you also need to see where you aren&#x2019;t getting the data from and setup proper alerts and monitoring for the missing data. From a business perspective, it is also advisable to surface that kind of detail all the way to the user. If you are going to be ordering inventory for the stores in a particular state, but the two major stores in the area are down because of a network issue and has been down for two days now, you want to be aware of that and figure out that you are working on out of date data.To be honest, the issues isn&#x2019;t so much about two days of lag in the case of once in blue moon type of error. In the scenario outlined above, in pretty much all business scenarios that I can think of, you won&#x2019;t really see any impact on the decision making of the organization. The killer is when you have some sort of a problem that goes on for a while. A DNS update that was missed because of bad DNS cache policy, for example. Now your updates to HQ go into the void in a consistent basis. On the other hand, everything else continue to function properly both locally and for HQ. If this isn&#x2019;t accounted for, it is easy to miss this for a long period of time. I have seen such a case that was only discovered when the year&#x2019;s end numbers didn&#x2019;t quite match up what they were supposed to. Given that this was the second year in a row this happened, the investigation found that some network issue indeed cause a very long term topology failure. This was actually properly reported, in a log file that no one ever read. Lesson learned, make sure that part of your data flow strategy accounts for such things and bring them to the users&#x2019; attention. Actually resolving the issue was a network configuration change that took minutes and the entire dataset was synchronized within a few hours afterward. But finding out that there was even a problem took effectively forever.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We designed RavenDB to be a server side database, to be used to run large scale business applications. Surprisingly for us, there is a large group of users that have taken RavenDB and actually run it as part of their deployed systems. In other words, instead of having a single large RavenDB cluster they will typically deploy many (hundreds in the small cases, tens of thousands to millions in the large cases) of RavenDB instances across a wide variety of locations.Part of that is the fact that RavenDB can be embedded inside an application quite easily. That means that we don&#x2019;t need complex setup or administration. You can just use RavenDB from your application and everything Will Just Work. Another factor is the fact that you can run RavenDB on very low end machines, including 32 bits machines, ARM SoC, etc.One use case was a point of sales system that had to spec out their hardware a decade in advanced and had to deal with existing installations that were still running hardware from 10 years ago (with little desire to upgrade). Another use case was deploying RavenDB as part of an industrial robot package, with RavenDB installed on a 32 bits ARM system on chip that control the robot. That kind of deployment pattern lead to interesting requests. For example, several of our customers need ad hoc replication in a location. So all the nodes in a particular physical location will join together to a full mesh of replicated nodes. This gives us high availability in a particular location with any node in the network being able to service any request across the entire location. Boot up a new machine, wait a bit for the rest of the network to update it and you are good to go. This also helps when you consider your machines to be unreliable (because they are old, beaten down and generally minimally maintained). Another scenario with the need for dynamic topologies is the deployment of RavenDB as set of independent nodes that need to report to some sort of head quarters. This is easy to do by defining external replication or ETL on the node and have it send all the relevant data to a central location for processing. This way, you get a cheap &#x201C;always available&#x201D; local node but can still have a global view of your data. I posted about something similar in the past, if you care for the details.We are now looking for additional features to serve this kind of deployment. In particular, we are interested in making it easy to share data and generate analytics across widely distributed and separated set of instances. One of things that we are currently considering is some form of integration with the cloud. For example, consider Amazon Athena, which allow you to run analytics queries on files residing in S3. We can define ETL processes that would upload the data from RavenDB as it is changed on each individual node. This way, you have each node pushing data to the cloud and a central location that can run live analytics on the data.What are your thoughts on this? And what other features do you think will serve this kind of scenario?</p>
