            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When your back is against the wall, and your only hope is for black magic (and alcohol). The title of this post is taken from this song. The topic of this post is a pretty sad one, but a mandatory discussion when dealing with data that you don&#x2019;t want to lose. We are going to discuss hard system failures.The source can be things like actual physical disk errors to faulty memory causing corruption. The end result is that you have a database that is corrupted in some manner. RavenDB actually have multiple levels of protections to detect such scenarios. All the data is verified with checksums on first load from the disk, and the transaction journal is verified when applying it as well. But stuff happens, and thanks to Murphy, that stuff isn&#x2019;t always pleasant. One of the hard criteria for the Release Candidate was a good story around catastrophic data recovery. What do I mean by that? I mean that something corrupted the data file in such a way that RavenDB cannot load normally. So sit on tight and let me tell you this story. We first need to define what we are trying to handle. The catastrophic data recovery feature is meant to:Recover user data (documents, attachments, etc) stored inside a RavenDB file. Recover as much data as possible, disregarding its state, letting user verify correctness (i.e, may recover deleted documents). Does not include indexed data, configuration, cluster settings, etc. This is because these can be quite easily handled by recreating indexes or setting up a new cluster.Does not replace high availability, backups or proper preventive maintenance.Does not attempt to handle malicious corruption of the data. Basically. the idea is that when you are shit creek, we can hand you paddle. That said, you are still up in shit creek.I mentioned previously that RavenDB go to quite some length to ensure that it knows when the data on disk is messed up. We also did a lot of work into making sure that when needed, we can actually do some meaningful work to extract your data out. This means that when looking at the raw file format, we actually have extra data there that isn&#x2019;t actually used for anything in RavenDB except by the recovery tools. That reason (the change to the file format) was why it was a Stop-Ship priority issue. Given that we are already in catastrophic data recovery mode, we can make very little assumption about the state of the data. A database is a complex beast, involving a lot of moving parts and the on disk format is very complex and subject to a lot of state and behavior. We are already in catastrophic territory, so we can&#x2019;t just use the data as we would normally would. Imagine a tree where following the pointers to the lower level might at some cases lead to garbage data or invalid memory. We have to assume that the data has been corrupted. Some systems handle this by having two copies of the master data records. Given that RavenDB is assumed to run on modern file systems, we don&#x2019;t bother this. ReFS on Windows and ZFS on Linux handle that task better and we assume that production usage will use something similar. Instead, we designed the way we store the data on disk so we can read through the raw bytes and still make sense of what is going on inside it.In other words, we are going to effectively read one page (8KB) at a time, verify that the checksum matches the expected value and then look at the content. If this is a document or an attachment, we can detect that and recover them, without having to understand anything else about the way the system work. In fact, the recovery tool is intentionally limited to a basic forward scan of the data, without any understanding of the actual file format.There are some complications when we are dealing with large documents (they can span more than 8 KB) and large attachments (we support attachments that are more then 2GB in size) can requite us to jump around a bit, but all of this can be done with very minimal understanding of the file format. The idea was that we can&#x2019;t rely on any of the complex structures (B&#x2B;Trees, internal indexes, etc) but can still recover anything that is still recoverable.This also led to an interesting feature. Because we are looking at the raw data, whenever we see a document, we are going to write it out. But that document might have actually been deleted. The recovery tool doesn&#x2019;t have a way of checking (it is intentionally limited) so it just write it out. This means that we can use the recovery tool to &#x201C;undelete&#x201D; documents. Note that this isn&#x2019;t actually guaranteed, don&#x2019;t assume that you have an &#x201C;undelete&#x201D; feature, depending on the state of the moon and the stomach content of the nearest duck, it may work, or it may not. The recovery tool is important, but it isn&#x2019;t magic, so some words of caution are in order. If you have to use the catastrophic data recovery tool, you are in trouble. High availability features such as replication and offsite replica are the things you should be using, and backups are so important I can&#x2019;t stress it enough. The recommended deployment for RavenDB 4.0 is going to be in a High Availability cluster with scheduled backups. The recovery tool is important for us, but you should assume from the get go that if you need to use it, you aren&#x2019;t in a good place.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Two years ago almost to the day (I just checked) we started the initial design and implementation process for RavenDB 4.0. Today, it is with great pride and joy that I can tell you that we have the Release Candidate ready and available for download.During the past two years we have improved RavenDB performance by an order of magnitude, drastically simplified operations and monitoring, introduced a new query language and distributed cluster technology, to name just a few highlights of the work that has been done. You&#x2019;ll find RavenDB easier to use, much faster and packed full of features. We are now almost done. The next few months are going to see us focus primarily on stabilization, smoothing the user experience and the behavior of the cluster and the database and in general making things nicer. We started with making things work, then making them work fast and now we are the stage where we want to make sure that it using RavenDB is a true pleasure. We are almost there, but we still need to work on things like deployment story, write documentation, provide a migration pathway, verify that the UI make sense even if you aren&#x2019;t aware of what is going on under the hood, etc. In general, a lot of detailed work that is going to take time but everything major has been done.I&#x2019;m quite happy about it, if you can&#x2019;t tell from the text so far.The current road map calls for spending another 6 &#x2013; 10 weeks in pushing RavenDB as far as we can to see how it behaves and filling in all the remaining touch ups and then pushing for release. We&#x2019;ll probably also have an RC2 before, with Go Live capabilities.In the meantime, if you are working on a new project with RavenDB I highly recommend switching to RavenDB 4.0. Note that the migration currently between 3.5 and 4.0 involved exporting your database on 3.5 and importing it on 4.0 and that you might have to make some minor changes to your code when you upgrade your applications to RavenDB 4.0. We&#x2019;ll have a better story around upgrading from RavenDB 3.5 in the next RC, but we also want to hear from you about the kind of scenarios that needs to be supported there. In every metric that I can think of, RavenDB 4.0 is far superior, so I suggest moving as soon as possible to it. You&#x2019;ll be able to upgrade seamlessly from the RC release to RC2 or RTM without any trouble. RavenDB 4.0 is available for Windows (64 &amp; 32 bits), Ubuntu (14 &amp; 16 &#x2013; 64 bits), Raspberry PI and on Docker (Windows Nano Server and Ubuntu images).We also released a .NET client and will follow up soon with Python, JVM, Node.JS, Ruby and Go clients. Your feedback on all aspects of RavenDB 4.0 is desired and welcome, let it pour in.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB 4.0 is going to have a completely free community edition that you could use to run production systems. We do this with the expectation that users will go with the community edition and either will be happy there or upgrade at some point to the commercial editions.As part of the restructuring we are doing, we intend to also significantly simplify the support model. Our current support model is per RavenDB instance with professional support costing 2,000$ per instance and production (24/7) support costing 6,000$. We got a lot of feedback on this being complex to work with. In particular, the per instance cost meant that operations would need to talk to us during redeployments in order to maintain coverage of all their RavenDB instances.As part of the Great Simplification we do in 4.0 we also want to tackle the issue of support. As a result, with the rollout of the RavenDB 4.0 RC we are going to move to flat support costs. Professional Support will cost 15% of the license cost and give you access to our support engineers with a guaranteed next business day response time.Production Support will cost 30% of the license cost and give you access to the core team members with 24/7 availability.This is a significant reduction in price, because we are trying to encourage more people to get support and our previous approach was unbalanced. The community support will continue to be offered, obviously, but we have no SLA around issues raised there.The commercial support options will only be available for the Professional and Enterprise editions. Here is how the costs change between RavenDB 3.x and RavenDB 4.5 for production support:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;RavenDB 3.x&#xA;RavenDB 4.0&#xA;Savings&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Standard &#x2B; Production Support&#xA;6,698$ &#xA;5,843$&#xA;15% reduction&#xA;Enterprise 4 Cores &#x2B;Production Support9,152$6,864$33% reduction</p>
