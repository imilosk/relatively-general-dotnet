            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, I now have a pretty rough idea about how the codebase actually works. I still think that the codebase is quite ugly. For example, take a look at this: The len parameter for CreateFile is whatever to open or create or just open (read only). But why is it in a parameter called len?  Probably because it was just there, and it would be a sin to create another local variable just for this, I guess (in a codebase where a method had &gt; 18 local variables!).&#xA0; To make things more interesting, in the rest of this method, this is actually a string len variable, sigh. At any rate, let us actually dig deeper now. The following structure is holding data about a db.  This is actually somewhat misleading, at least with regards to how I would think about a db. This is the entry point for all the pages that belong to a specific db. But a db in LMDB is not really the same thing as a db in SQL Server or RavenDB. It all reside in the same file, and you always have at least two. The first one is the free db, which is used to track all the free pages. The second one is the main db. Then you have additional, named databases.  This is used here:  This define the metadata for the entire environment. Note that we have the two dbs there in mm_dbs. The mm_txnid denotes the last committed transaction id. This value is what gives LMDB its MVCC support.&#xA0; The mm_last_pg value is the last used page, any transaction that wants to write will start writing at that value.  Let us see how we deal with pages here, shall we?  The first part find try to find a dirty page if we are in a read/write transaction and we haven&#x2019;t specify that we can write directly to memory. This is done by doing a binary search on the list of dirty pages.  Otherwise, we can just hand the user the actual page by accessing it directly. Next, let us look where this is actually used. Searching for a page with a specific key in it. This is done mostly in mdb_node_search.   This seems to be doing a binary search for the keys inside a specific page (in this case, the page that is at the top of the stack on the cursor). That leads to the conclusion that pages internally have data internally stored as sorted arrays. And this leads me to another pet peeve with this code base. Take a look at this line:  Sure, this is a well known trick to cheaply divide&#xA0; a number by half, but are you seriously telling me that the compiler isn&#x2019;t going to optimize&#xA0; (low &#x2B; high) / 2 ? To my knowledge, no C compiler updated in the last 10 &#x2013; 15 years managed to miss this optimization. So why write code that is going to be harder to read? Okay, so now we know how we search for a specific key inside a page, but how do we get to the actual page that we want to search on? This happens on mdb_page_search_root. Let me see if I can take it apart. When this method is called, the cursor is setup so the first page on the pages stack is the root page.&#xA0;  And&#x2026; that is enough for me. Up until now, I have been trying to just read the code. Not execute it, not debug through it, nothing .Just go over the code one line at a time and figure out what is going on. I actually think that I have a really good grasp about what is going on in there, but I think that this is pretty much all I can do at that point from just reading the code. So I am going to stop now and setup an debug environment so I can work with it, and report my finding from stepping through the code.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, our managed implementation of leveldb is just about ready to go out and socialize. Note that those are just for a relatively short duration, but they give us good indicator of where we are. We are still running longer term perf tests now. Also note that they are early numbers. We did performance work, but it is still not done. The following tests were done on a HDD, and all include writing a million records (16 bytes key, 100 bytes values) to storage.  Writing 1 million sequential keys - 52,152 op/s Writing 1 million random keys -&#xA0; 11,986 op/s Writing 1 million sequential keys with fsync - 17,225 op/s And now, for the reads portion:  Sequential reads - 104,620 op/s Reverse sequential reads - 57,932 op/s Random reads - 3,191 op/s Note that I am pretty sure that the reason for the later performance is that it is using an HDD, instead of SSD.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As it stand the World&#x2019;s Smallest No&#xA0; SQL Database will last only as long as you actually have power. The moment that you have a restart, all the data is gone. The is actually how several databases are running, but for now, we are going to assume that this is not desirable. The question now becomes, how do you actually store the data on disk? This really becomes a pretty complex question, because you need to store the data on disk in a way that is crash safe, allow updates, and doesn&#x2019;t take all the disk space in the world. Before we will get to the actual on disk data structures, we need to discuss how we implement persistent logs. Persistent logs are the key way that databases gets Durability. And as it turned out, there are just two ways of doing that that I am aware of:  Append only Transaction log Append only models rely on the fact that you only append to create a safe way to ensure that the data is either all in or all out. When we write, we don&#x2019;t overwrite values, we are creating new values, and then we write where the last log entry is located. In CouchDB, for example, this is done by modifying the header portion of the file to point to the new data. In LMDB this is done by updating the page listing with the new pages. In both cases, you actually commit a transaction when the on disk pointer is changed to point to the new data. If you crash midway, nothing bad happened, you didn&#x2019;t update the on disk pointer, it is still pointing at the old location. Worst case scenario, you wasted some disk space, and you probably have a way to reclaim that anyway. Transaction logs use a different way to handle this. They are also usually implemented as append only files, into which we write the new data. Afterward, we can apply those changes in memory / on disk safely. A crash would simply mean having to replay the log. This is how leveldb, for example, works. This is also the essential idea behind how SQL Server Oracle works. Although in their case I believe that the transaction log usually contain both prev/new state of the pages they changed for a specific transaction.  One thing that you have to be aware of, either way, is that you should be prepared to handle scenarios where your process crashed midway, or when your entire machine had the plug pulled out. That means using fsync, sure, but it also means that you might have to do log replay, or be ready to see if you can recover something from the append only model. The good thing about the transaction log approach is that after you have committed the changes to the standard persistent format, you can clear it (usually by just creating a new file and deleting the old one). With the append only model, you usually have to run some sort of compaction to clear things out. Note that the transaction log model vs append only model doesn&#x2019;t really mean about how the rest of the persistent data is actually stored. We will touch on that on the next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Tobi had a few questions about memory mapped files. And it is quite an interesting topic. A memory mapped file is a feature for all modern operating system. It require coordination between the memory manager and the I/O subsystem. Basically, you can tell the OS that some file is the backing store for a certain portion of the process memory. In order to understand that, we have to understand virtual memory.  Here is your physical memory, using 32 bits for ease of use:  Now, you have two processes that are running. Each of them get their own 4 GB address space (actually, only 2 GB is available to the process in 32 bits, but that is good enough). What happen when both of those processes obtain a pointer to 0x0232194?  Well, what actually happens is that the pointer that looks like a pointer to physical memory is actually a virtual pointer, which the CPU and the OS work together to map to physical memory. It is obvious from the image that there is a problem here, what happens if two processes uses 4GB each? There isn&#x2019;t enough physical memory to handle that. This is the point were the page file gets involved. So far, this is pretty basic OS 101 stuff. The next stuff is where it gets interesting. So the OS already knows how to evict pages from memory and store them on the file system, because it needs to do that for the page file. The next step is to make use of that for more than just the page file. So you can map any file into your memory space. Once that is done, you can access the part of the memory you have mapped and the OS will load the relevant parts of the file to memory. Again, pretty basic stuff so far. You can read about this more in this article. The reason you want to do this sort of thing is that it gives you the ability to work with files as if it was memory. And you don&#x2019;t have to worry about all that pesky file I/O stuff. The OS will take care of that for you. And now, to Tobi&#x2019;s questions:  What are the most important advantages and disadvantages?  Probably the most important is that you don&#x2019;t have to do manual file I/O. That can drastically reduce the amount of work you have to do, and it can also give you a pretty significant perf boost. Because the I/O is actually being managed by the operation system, you gain a lot of experience in optimizing things. And the OS will do things like give you a page buffer, caching, preloading, etc.&#xA0; It also make it drastically easier to do parallel I/O safely, since you can read/write from &#x201C;memory&#x201D; concurrently without having to deal with complex API.  The disadvantages you need to be aware that things like the base addresses would change whenever you re-open the file, and that data structures that are good in memory might not result in good performance if they are stored on disk.  Another problem relates to how the changes actually are saved to the file. It is hard to make sure that the writes you do are coherently stored in the file system. For example, let us say that you made changes to two different memory locations, which reside on two different pages. The OS can decide, at any time, to take one of those pages away from you because it needs that memory for other things. When that happens, it will write that page to disk for you. So when you ask for it the next time, it can load it up again and the application won&#x2019;t notice. However, what would happen during a crash? You might have partially written data in that scenario. Usually, when writing to files using file I/O routines, you have very predictable write pattern. When you use memory mapped files for writes, you don&#x2019;t know for sure in what order that is going to happen. The OS is free to choose that. There are ways you can control that. For example, you might use FILE_MAP_COPY to avoid the OS writing stuff for you, but you would have to handle writes yourself now, and that is decidedly not trivial. You can use something like FlushViewOfFilew() to make sure that a specific range is flushed, but that still doesn&#x2019;t mean that they will be written in any order that you might expect. As a db writer, I care, quite deeply, about the exact way the data is written to file, because otherwise it is really hard to reason about how to read it back. Especially when you have to consider failures and corruptions. Personally, I would be writing stuff using memory mapped file for data that I needed critical stuff for.  Why are using well known products like SQL Server custom caches instead of memory mappings? SQL Server is actually its own operating system. It managed memory, locks, threads, I/O and a lot more. That comes from the fact that for a long time, it had to do those sort of things. But note that SQL Server probably use memory mapped file quite a lot. But they are also using their own custom caches because it make sense to them. For example, query plan cache. Even when you do have memory mapped files, you usually have multiple layers of caching. In RavenDB, for example, we have the native page cache (managed by Esent), the documents cache (managed by RavenDB) and the client cache. The reason that we have multiple layers is that we cache different things. The client cache avoid having to call the server. The documents cache avoid having to parse documents and the native page cache avoid having to go to disk.   Why are other products like LevelDB using mmap instead of custom caches?  Because they are drastically simpler products. They really want to just give you the data as quickly as possible, and they don&#x2019;t need to do additional processing of the data. They can lean on the OS page cache to a much larger extent. Note that when use in real products, there are often higher level caches that they will use anyway, used for storing processed / parsed information.   Are they well suited for managed code?  Memory Mapped Files are usually harder to use from managed code, because we don&#x2019;t do our own memory management. It does meant that you lose the benefit of just treating this as part of your memory space, because there is a very clear line between managed memory and native memory, and memory mapped files are on the other side of the hatch. That said, you can easily use them via UnmanagedMemoryStream, or read from them directly via Memory Accessor. The managed implementation for leveldb make heavy use of memory mapped files.  How does performance compare with other techniques?  It is generally better, mostly because the OS is really good in managing paging, and that you rely directly on the low level I/O routines. Another thing that you have to remember that if you use file I/O, you need to create a buffer, copy to/from that buffer, etc. Using memory mapped files saves all of that.   Is it possible to use them with mutable data structures and retain crash recoverability?  Yes, but&#x2026; is probably the best answer. Yes, you can use them for mutable data, but you really want to be careful about how you do it. In particular, you need to make sure that you write in such a way that you can survive partial writes. A good way of doing that is to make writes to specific pages, and you &#x201C;commit&#x201D; by recording that those pages are now available on a metadata page, or something like that. This require a lot of really careful work, to be honest. Probably more work than you would like it to be. LMDB does it this way, and even if the code wasn&#x2019;t a eye tearing pain, what it is doing is quite hard. Note that in order to actually be sure that you a flushing to disk, you have to call both FlushViewOfFile and FlushFileBuffers on Windows.  What guarantees does the OS make regarding ordering and durability? Pretty much none regarding ordering, as noted. Windows will guarantee that if both FlushViewOfFile and FlushFileBuffers&#xA0; have been called and successfully completed, you are golden. But there aren&#x2019;t any promises in the API about what will happen for partway failures, or in what order this happens. To summarize: Memory mapped files are a great tool, and for reads, they are excellent. For writes, they are awesome, but since there is no way to ensure in what order dirty pages gets written to disk, it make it hard to generate reliable system using them. I rather use standard file I/O for writes, since that is far more predictable.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Even for a first attempt, World&#x2019;s Smallest No&#xA0; SQL Database is actually pretty good. We got 3 of the 4. The DB is:  Atomic, since change will either go in or be rejected. Consistent, you can&#x2019;t see changes half way. Isolated, one change can&#x2019;t modify/view another. It isn&#x2019;t durable, because everything is in memory. It even has transactions, in the sense that a change goes in or not in an atomic fashion. But, I think you&#x2019;ll agree, this is very much a poor man&#x2019;s solution. And those only apply just as long as you need to work with just a single item. In practice, you would usually want to make a lot more than that.  The basic properties you want is the ability to do multi item transactions, so you can modify two items at the same time, and they either go in or not at all. And that is where it gets really&#xA0; complex, because at that point we need to build our own way to handle atomic updates to multiple values, how to keep them isolated and how to handle this consistently. There aren&#x2019;t really simple way to handle that, especially if we want to handle concurrent transactions. You would have to make a lot of decisions all of a sudden. For example, what happens if you have two concurrent transactions trying to update the same value. Is one of them rejected? And if so, at what point? Initial write? Commit time? And that is just the start.   Do you allow a transaction to live across multiple requests?  How do you handle transaction expiration?  Do you need to have a transaction span more than one node? How do you handle that? And we haven&#x2019;t even talked about making transactions durable. There is no point, since we don&#x2019;t do any persistence. But we will touch on persistence in a future post, so let talk about durability right now. In general, there are two major ways to handle transactions. Either an append only model or a transaction log. In both cases, concurrent transactions make it&#x2026; interesting to figure out how to properly write to the log. And the moment that you have either option, you have to build in some form of a recovery tool for system or db crashes. You have better also love fsync, since it is a very important tool in making sure that you can actually get durable transactions.  Oh, and of course, I forgot, if we allow long running transactions&#x2026;  Who can read the yet uncommitted value? Everyone? Just the current transaction? Can you explicitly ask to see uncommitted value? How do you allow it to be read? Is it available for queries? This is usually the most touchy part in the system, since is so critical. It is also something that you have to take into account in pretty much the entire codebase.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We got the following question on the mailing list:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x2026;say you have reference data in one document like prices, formulas, etc.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;When the user is editing or creating a document you would like to ensure that their edits are based on the current info at the time of edit.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;So the document being edited or created is dependent on the other reference document and the commit should raise a concurrency error if that reference document has changed in between the time the edit started and it is committed.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Of course the reference document is not changed with the document being edited/created.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This question is interesting enough to be worth a blog post. Mostly because this was my reaction when I read the post.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Basically, the premise is wrong. The user have a document like &#x201C;config/tax-rates&#x201D;, and when they create an order, they need to make sure that the tax rate hasn&#x2019;t changed. I am assuming here that &#x201C;time between edit started &amp; committed&#x201D; is relatively low, counted in milliseconds, and that there isn&#x2019;t any human involvement in this process.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The reason this is wrong is the following sequence of events (T&#x2B;1 is time &#x2B; 1 ms):&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Scenario #1&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Scenario #2&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;0 &#x2013; read referenced doc&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;1 &#x2013; create order&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;2 &#x2013; config/tax-rates changed&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;3 &#x2013; save order&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;4 &#x2013; concurrency error because the config/tax-rates changed&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;0 &#x2013; read referenced doc&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;1 &#x2013; create order&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;2 &#x2013; save order&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;3 &#x2013; save order completed&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;T &#x2B;4 &#x2013; config/tax-rates changed&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;According to the question above, both scenarios are absolutely correct ways for the system to behave. In practice, scenario #2 is wrong (probably).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Udi Dahan has wrote about this a lot, but I can&#x2019;t find the appropriate article at this time.&#xA0;Update:&#xA0;http://www.udidahan.com/2010/08/31/race-conditions-dont-exist/&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;If it actually matter enough for scenario #1 to require an error, scenario #2 is also invalid. This isn&#x2019;t a technical issue, it is a business issue. If you failed to update the tax rate after you were notified, you are responsible for it, right? Except that there is no way that this works. Tax changes usually take place at midnight, and are announced several days / weeks in advanced, at a minimum. And even if you were in a total news blackout, you are still responsible for the rate change, even if you never heard about it.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The way this is setup is simply wrong. You don&#x2019;t try to stop orders from being processed, because you are going to miss the just completed order. Instead, you are going to do compensation logic to fix any changes that apply.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You can also tell that this is the case by the fact that this is actually pretty hard to do. Documents are independent from one another. The best way to work with such a scenario is to record the time (or the etag) when you made a decision based on a related document, then at a later point in time, you can make a decision based on whatever it changed, how old it is, etc.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That gives you proper frame of mind, not trying to count milliseconds.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I decided to resume my attempt to figure out the LMDB codebase. Okay, I did some more figuring out and I think that I know where I went wrong. The codebase appears to be trying small enough to fit into the CPU caches, in order to do that, they decided to make it hard enough to make sure it won&#x2019;t fit into my cache. But I&#x2019;m trying to work through that.  One of the things that I figured out was that I made a mistake, I kept thinking about databases in the same way you&#x2019;ll see in RavenDB or SQL Server, as complete separate items. Instead, LMDB does something quite different. It basically uses a single file for everything. This is called the environment, and that can contains named dbs. If you have multiple databases, all of them are going to reside in the same file. The way it works, it creates a file and then map it into memory. On Windows, it actually allocate the space for the file upfront (which doesn&#x2019;t appears to be necessary).   But the basic idea is that you need to specify upfront the size of the file you want, and that is the maximum data size you have. This can change, but only if you close the environment and start it up again with a higher value. This also explains why you have to specify the number of databases you want to have per environment.&#xA0; Once you created the environment, everything else become an issue of just managing the pages. In particular, because LMDB only allows a single writer, it doesn&#x2019;t really have to worry about concurrency issues. It has mapped all the data into memory, and then it is just a matter of creating the appropriate data structure. A lot of the code is dedicated to managing pages of data, and now that I have gone through enough of the codebase to be sure that I sort of have a vague idea about what is going on I can still say that I think that this is way denser than it should. And I shudder to think what it would take to make any sort of change to this codebase.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I decided to resume my attempt to figure out the LMDB codebase. The previous attempt ended when my eyes started bleeding a little, but I think that I can get a bit further now. One thing that I figured out already is that because this is C code, memory management is really painful. I noted previous how good it was from leveldb to use std::string for most allocations, since it frees both caller and lib from having to worry about the memory. LMDB only shows how important that was. Take a look at the following method:  Quick, what do you think it does. As it turn out, what is does is update the key to point to the key that the cursor is currently pointing at. The reason for that is that the library doesn&#x2019;t want to own the memory for key (since then it would have to provide a way to free it).  Now, to be fair, this appears to be an internal method, only used by the lib itself, but such things are pretty pervasive in the codebase, and it is really annoying that the code is all in one spot, with no real structure, since I am still trying to figure out some sort of hierarchy for the code so I could get a grip on what is actually going on. I decided to just go to the start and figure out how it opens a database:  It is interesting that you need a transaction to open the database. However, the opened database survives the transaction closing, and from the docs, if you open a db in a transaction, that is the only thing you can do in that transaction. I think that I just figured out something, the code in mdb.c is actually written in reverse depth order. So the closer to the end of the file a function is, the more visible it is.  Okay, it appears that there is the notion of multiple dbs, but there is also the notion of the main db. It looks like the main db is also used for tracking things for child dbs. In particular, when opening a named db, we have the following: We search for the db information in the main db. As you can see, mdb_cursor_set is actually setting the data on the cursor to the value we passed in. More interesting is what happens if the db is not there. It appears to merely create the db data and set it in the main db. Okay, looking at this function docs, it appears that this is just about allocating a database handle, not about opening the actual database. I am not really sure that I understand the reasoning behind it, but a new database is actually created in mdb_cursor_put. So only after the first time you create a value, will the db actually be created.  I guess that explains why this function goes on for over 400 lines of code and has no less than 10 goto(!) and 7 goto sections!  I get that this is C, but come on, seriously!</p>
