            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Why did you write your own blogging software? I can hear a lot of people asking. The answer, to tell you the truth, is actually quite simple.  I needed it. My blogging habits puts me quite outside any curve that you care to name, and the usual blogging software just don&#x2019;t take some stuff into account. Probably the most important aspect of that is the notion of scheduling. When I got the muse, I got the muse, and I post a lot. Just to give you some idea, the entire Microsoft N Layer App Sample was posted during one morning at the office. This would be my 6th post of the day, etc. That means that the process of sending a new post out has to be as automated as possible, including when to schedule it.  Raccoon Blog does this for me, finding out the latest blog post and scheduling the new post on the next work day. But it gets better, because blogging is basically writing over time, it is important to actually see it that way. Here is the main admin screen for Raccoon Blog:  As you can see, all of the posts are outlined nicely on a calendar, giving a real sense of when they are going to be posted. It is also showing a problem. When I do a series, I usually write all of them at once, and then dump it to the queue. But it is not necessarily the best case for reading. If you don&#x2019;t care for the topic of the series, you might be bored for a long time. So it is good to mix up content a bit. This is magic, but Raccoon Blog lets me drag &amp; drop posts to new dates, meaning that in a few minutes, I can mix up the content so the blog wouldn&#x2019;t be a one track topic for weeks on end. And the reason it is magic is that this is so much better than the alternatives that I have tried that it feels like heaven. Here is how it looks like after the re-ordering:  Now that is more like it, mixed topics, a lot of stuff that would interest you (I hope) and no pain at all during the entire process.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing my review of http://microsoftnlayerapp.codeplex.com/, an Official Guidance (shows up at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/architecture/en) which people are expected to read and follow. Well, this is probably going to be the last post on the topic, because to be frank, I am getting a headache and I don&#x2019;t really see the point anymore. I would strongly advise anyone looking at this sample application to consider it to be the epitome of worst practices and what not to do. I am frankly stunned to see something like that. I didn&#x2019;t spend a lot of time with the application, and I more or less just skimmed it here and there, and almost every single time, I found something that horrified me.  Yes, there are places for disagreements when you discuss software architecture, places where a decision can go both ways and while you might disagree with it, you can live with it. This isn&#x2019;t such a case, this is a case of a project that is literally choke full of traps and scary places. If you don&#x2019;t look too deep, it says all the right things, but once you get a bit deeper, you can see how this is causing a black hole in your mind, eating away anywhere where good things can grow. This is the ultimate architectural exercise, building an architecture without building an application.  Except that you can&#x2019;t talk about an architecture in isolation, architecture is always driven by the actual needs of the application, not by whatever the architect read about last night and is dying to see how it works in the real world. This isn&#x2019;t how this it done, and attempting to follow the guidance in this manner would result in a lot of time and money going down the drain.  I can&#x2019;t emphasize this enough, avoid this codebase, don&#x2019;t look at it, and never try to follow anything shown there, it will end in tears, pain and suffering. I have a headache now, and I think that I&#x2019;ll stop before it goes over the top.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After spending so much time talking about the application, I think that you can understand why this isn&#x2019;t going to work:  For a start, we don&#x2019;t create an Inmate. A prison just doesn&#x2019;t have this concept.&#xA0; Second, the process of accepting a new Inmate into the prison is a pretty complex one. An Inmate can come from one of several sources. It can be a guy just brought in from the streets or it can be an Inmate from another prison (and then it depends on where he came from), etc. Each scenario requires different workflow for processing the new Inmate. And what about errors in the process? For example, let us say that your prison is rated for 14 years old and up, and suddenly you have at the gate an officer with three 13 years old that were just arrested with suicide belts. Legally, you aren&#x2019;t allowed to hold them. Practically, you can&#x2019;t really let them go. (For the record, that was a real scenario that happened, I had to get a judge to approve this.) Here is another true story. I sent an Inmate to another prison, and along the way, the escort manage to forget the documents (those are the oh so important that the sky fall down and smacks you in the head if you don&#x2019;t have them) in my prison. They got to the other prison around 2 AM, and only then discovered what happened. I was able to convince that prison&#x2019;s commander to hold the guy until morning in his prison until I can send the documents.  Validation? You make me laugh. This is the real world, and if your system reject an Inmate that the prison commander has decided that he is going to accept&#x2026; well, that Inmate still has to be tracked, but now it is offline and probably done on the back of some envelope somewhere. The system may alert and warn, but it cannot deny people. Welcome to the real world. Overall, the process for accepting a new inmate is quite simple, at its core. You need to be able to identify the Inmate, and you need to have a valid chain of lawful incarceration. The first might be a problem (the guy might have been just picked up, have no idea and refuse to identify himself). The second might also be a problem, as we have seen above. But eventually, we have the Dossier for an Inmate, which contains name, id, picture and the chain of lawful incarceration. The next step is to place the Inmate in the prison, and that is a whole different key of gunpowder. I&#x2019;ll discuss that in my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am not sure if you have noticed, but for the last few weeks, we have had a small tag on the top left side of the blog. Clicking on this would reveal the following information:  As you can see, generating the main page took 6 sessions and 8 calls to the RavenDB server. This reflect the fact that when building RaccoonBlog, we were far more focused on the architecture and paid very little attention to the actual performance of the system and mostly focus on being correct and architecturally sound.  I&#x2019;ll point out that with no attention to performance, the new blog out performs the old blog quite handily. We can dig a bit deeper into what is going on here:    As you can see, we have a list of requests made to the server, including all of the queries made. This make it quite easy to figure out what is actually going on. For bonus points, we can even dig deeper and look at an individual request:  From debugging stand point, it is incredibly helpful. From a performance optimization perspective, it is invaluable. This feature alone has been responsible for three different bug fixes (all of them very hard to figure out without it) and has guided us into several performance improvements for the blog. We took the idea from the Mini MVC Profiler, I really liked the idea of that, but didn&#x2019;t really like the code, so we set out to build Raven.Client.MvcIntegration.dll. In your MVC application, you need to reference that assembly and:  In the Application_Start method, call Raven.Client.MvcIntegration.RavenProfiler.InitializeFor(documentStore). In your main layout, include the following line: @Raven.Client.MvcIntegration.RavenProfiler.CurrentRequestSessions() That would setup the RavenDB Profiler for MVC applications, giving you direct access to whatever is going on in that request. We even handle Ajax requests as well  And a minor point as well, this feature is probably not something that you would use in production, but since I wanted to show it off for you, I made sure that it can be run in production. In order to facilitate this, there is a way to redact the information sent to the client, scrubbing it from any personal information. That has been done on this blog, but it is a fairly simple system, compromised mostly of the ability to black list specific fields by name. I would be careful when exposing this to the world, but especially if you are using this to see what is going on against a remote RavenDB instance, it can be invaluable tool.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing my review of http://microsoftnlayerapp.codeplex.com/, an Official Guidance (shows up at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/architecture/en) which people are expected to read and follow. Is it not invented here if a Microsoft project chooses to re-invent something that Microsoft already did? Take a look at how queries are being performed:  That looks strange, let us dig a bit deeper, shall we?  And it is not alone! It has a full family and some friends too:    &#xA0; So you create a specification, and then you call that specification to create an expression tree, and then you use that expression tree for the queries.&#xA0; If only we had builtin specification support in the framework! Oh, wait! It is called Linq! And it is already being used here, so they obviously know about it. And no, this isn&#x2019;t the case of needing to serialize specification over the wire, they are used in the same process as the one where the queries execute on. I mean, seriously! You didn&#x2019;t consider just dropping all of those abstractions and getting the work done? Oh, I forgot, there isn&#x2019;t any work to be done, the application isn&#x2019;t actually doing anything, all the abstractions are the point.</p>
