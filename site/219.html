            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Just asked a candidate to do a task that requires an O(1) retrieval semantics.&#xA0; Off the top of his head, he answered that he would us a Trie.&#xA0; That is an exciting new development in phone interviews, since this data structure doesn&#x2019;t come up all too often.I asked him to explain why he didn&#x2019;t chose a dictionary as the underlying data structure. His answer was&#x2026; illuminating.He explained (in detail, and correctly) how hash maps work, that they rely on probability to ensure their O(1) guarantees and that he didn&#x2019;t feel that he could select such a data structure for O(1) performance before analyzing the distribution of the data and figuring out if there are too many expected collisions in the data set.All pretty much text book correct. In fact, if one is writing their own hash map (don&#x2019;t do that) that is a concern you need to take into account. But in the real world, this is usually a solved problem. There are certain malicious inputs that can get you into trouble and there are certain things you need to take into account if you are writing your own hash function. But for the vast majority of cases and scenarios, you don&#x2019;t need to worry about this at all.The candidate is a student in the last stages of his degree and it shows. He gave a wonderful answer, if this was a test. It was just so wonderfully wrong.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run across this Twitter thread and I&#x2019;m in&#x2026; awe, I want to say, but in a really horrifying manner. The thread started with DHH calling out this job posting:I&#x2019;ve marked the important piece. You can read the twitter thread for the gory details. Based on the job posting and the interaction of the CEO on twitter, I&#x2019;m going to assume that this job pay six to nine times more than the average developer can make, because otherwise I can&#x2019;t really figure out why anyone would work in such a place. I have had two (or three) separate burnouts before I was thirty. I was single, no kids, and I worked crazy hours. I was productive and I burned out. Mid 2009 was a fun time for me, I was physically nauseous every time I sat in front of a computer&#xA0; and seriously considered a career shift to construction. A large number of life decisions were made as a result of that. And while I admit that being young and discovering things is its own reward, this isn&#x2019;t really something new. Workplace productivity is not an unexplored subject and I would expect anyone in either HR or management position (and certainly a CEO in a company that is busy hiring people) to be at least peripherally aware of them.&#xA0; You might sometime need to work crazy hours, I fully understand crunch time and &#x201C;OMG, production is DOWN&#x201D;. But if you do that, you need to understand that this is done with eyes open.&#xA0; Such scenarios should be rare and you should be aware that any temporary increase in productivity will need to be paid off by reduced productivity down the line. Again, this isn&#x2019;t new. You can go to Ford in the early years on the last century to read more about how to increase productivity. So asking for 60 hours per week on an ongoing basis is pretty&#x2026; crazy.Let&#x2019;s assume that this is for five days a week position, shall we? Based on the job posting on the CEO&#x2019;s behavior on Twitter, I assume that it isn&#x2019;t the case, but humor me.This means, Monday to Friday, you start working at 9 AM and finish at 9 PM. If you have kids, this means never reading them a bed time story, not being able to see them perform, never coming to PTA meeting. If you have a spouse, it means a relationship that is mostly around texts, because you ain&#x2019;t going to see them.&#xA0; If you don&#x2019;t have a significant other, good luck finding one with the time allotted.&#xA0; But 12 hours days are probably not going to cut it. So let&#x2019;s say that you work only 10 hours a day, but we&#x2019;ll include Sunday as well, to make up for the &#x201C;lost time&#x201D;. You still log in at 9AM, but now you get to leave at 7 PM. Oh, and if you better not be sick, or have to drive your mom to the airport or need to visit the DMV. Nobody got any time for that. On a more serious note. This kind of environment will make you sick. It can take a lot of time to recover from that, both mentally and physically. I can&#x2019;t imagine anyone who would be signing up for something like that. Actually, I can, quite easily. There are plenty of professions where this is normal. To pick examples off the top of my head, lawyers, nurses and doctors all work crazy hours, or at least, that is the impression I have. Let&#x2019;s check, shall we? The following results are pretty much the first result of googling the question.Lawyers, for example, can expect to work 60&#x2B; hours a week on average. Nurses, on the other hand, are considered full time if they work about 36 &#x2013; 40 hours a week.Doctors, vary wildly, with 40 - 80 hours, depending on the type of specialty and where they are in their career. The key here, for both lawyers and doctors, is that typically after a pretty harsh initial period, you can expect to gain a lot for your work. In other words, there is a high probability that there is going to be a good return on this investment.&#xA0; For this job posting, again based solely on the text and the CEO&#x2019;s behavior, I&#x2019;m assuming there is no such upside. Whenever we sent job acceptance letter, I used to put in a statement about Hibernating Rhinos being a place where you didn&#x2019;t have to leave the office at 9 PM. Since then we grew a bit and got a few people who are a night owls, so they come later to the office. That somewhat spoils this statement, but I can still state that no one works crazy hours. By the way, that is not because some of the devs haven&#x2019;t tried. I&#x2019;m very familiar with the excitement of being almost there. At the cusp of figuring out this bug or completing that feature. It sometimes make sense to keep going and complete just this one task and getting there. And this is fine, if you pace yourself. But with some people, I had to tell them that if they keep staying so much in the office, I&#x2019;m going to start charging them rent. That seemed to do the trick. When I founded Hibernating Rhinos, I wanted to create a place that I would like which would give me interesting things to work on . In the decade that Hibernating Rhinos has been around, I don&#x2019;t believe that we ever had a crunch time that didn&#x2019;t directly relate to a customer problem (and these tend to be rare) . Whenever I had to make the choice, slipping the release date has always been the better option in my eyes rather than sacrificing quality or keeping people at their desk to try to get more done. This includes the last three years in which our team basically rebuilt a distributed database from the ground up and gotten a minimum of 10x performance improvement across the board. This was without anyone expected to put in sunrise to sundown shifts. Given that I think that this is about creating a marketing/sales platform. I&#x2019;m&#x2026; not impressed by that. In fact, I&#x2019;m pretty sure that if they start out with planning to squeeze their own people dry from the get go they have the same level of cluelessness in other aspects of the business. On the other hand, assuming that they actually manage to get a viable product out, someone is going to have a field day threading through all the holes that tired, listless and demotivated developers have left in the system. I think that I can summarize all of this post in a single word: BEWARE!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After we built the SQL Migration Wizard for RavenDB 4.1, we started to field questions about assistance in migrating from more databases. As a result of this, we have introduced a support for MongoDB and CosmosDB migration.I&#x2019;m going to walk you through how this works. First, you&#x2019;ll need to download the Release Candidate of RavenDB 4.1. In addition to the zip package, you&#x2019;ll need to download the Tools zip file as well. Next, run RavenDB and create a new database, then go to Settings &gt; Import Data and select From other. Here is what this will look like:I went to shodan.io and found a publicly available MongoDB server to test this out. The process completed successfully and gave me a single document:I guess someone already got to this instance. More seriously, I scanned literally the first page in this listing and was able to connect and retrieve real documents from a few of them. That included what looked like users (hashed) passwords, among other details. I deleted the dataAt any rate, you can use this wizard to pull data from a MongoDB instance to your RavenDB database. RavenDB will handle all the details of the transfer for you. There is even the option to use a transformation script to shape the data as it goes into RavenDB.You can do the same for CosmosDB, as you can see below:These credentials I got from doing a GitHub search. On the one hand, I&#x2019;m really happy that the feature works. On the other hand, I&#x2019;m pretty much in a state of despair from the state of security in general.We are looking into other databases that our users want to migrate from. If you have such a need, please let us know.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I designed RavenDB, I had a very particular use case at the forefront of my mind. That scenario was a business application talking to a database, usually as a web application.These kind of applications have a particular style of communication with the user. As you can see below, there are two very distinct operations. Show the user the data, followed by some &#x201C;think time&#x201D; (seconds at minimum, but can be much longer) and then followed by an action. This shouldn&#x2019;t really be a surprised for anyone who developed any kind of application for the last decade or two, so why do I mention this explicitly?&#xA0; I mention this because of the nature of communication between the application and the database.Some databases have a the conversation pattern with the application. In terms of API, this will look something like this:BeginTransaction()Update()Insert()Commit()This is a very natural model and should be quite familiar for most developers. The other alternative to this method is to use batches:SaveChanges( [Update, Insert] )I want to use this post to talk about the difference between the two styles and how that impacts your work. Relational databases uses the conversation style while RavenDB uses batch style. On the surface, it looks like it would be a more complex to use RavenDB to achieve the same task, but there is very little difference in the API as far as the user is concerned. In both cases, the code looks very much the same:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

In many cases, you can send all of these commands to the server in a single roundtrips, but that is an optimization that doesn&#x2019;t always work and often isn&#x2019;t applied even when it is possible.Sidebar: Reducing server roundtripsWhy is the reduction in server roundtrips so important? Because it has a lot of implications on the overall performance of the system. In many cases the cost of making a remote query from the application to the database far outstrips the costs of actually executing the query. This ties closely to the Fallacies of Distributed Computing. Latency isn&#x2019;t zero, even though when you develop locally it certainly seems like this is the case. The primary goal of this design in RavenDB was to reduce the number of network roundtrips that your application must endure. Because in the vast majority of the cases, your application is going to follow the &#x201C;show data&#x201D; / &#x201C;modify data&#x201D; as two separate operations (often separated by a long idle time) there is a lot of value in having the database interaction model match what you will actually be doing. As it turned out, there are some additional advantages (and disadvantages, which I&#x2019;ll cover a bit later) to this approach, beyond just the obvious reduction in the number of server roundtrips. When the server gets all the operations that needs to be done in a single request, it can apply all of them at once. For that matter, it can chose how to apply them in the most optimal order. This gives the database server a lot more chances for optimization. It is similar to going to the supermarket with a list of items to purchase vs. a treasure hunt. When you have the full list, you can decide to pick things up based on how close they are on the shelves. If you only get the next instruction after you complete the previous one, you have no option for optimization.When using the conversation style, durability and state management become more complex as well. Relational databases typically use some variation of ARIES for their journals. This is because they need to record information about ongoing transactions that haven&#x2019;t yet been committed. This add significant complexity to the amount of work that is required from the database engine. Furthermore, when running in a distributed system, you need to share this transaction state (which hasn&#x2019;t yet been committed!) across the nodes to allow failover of the transaction if the server fails. With the conversation style, you need to support concurrent transactions all operating at the same time and potentially reading and modifying the same data. This lead to a great deal of code that is required to properly manage locking and latching inside the database engine. On the other hand, batch mode give the server all the operations in the transaction in a single go. This means that failover can simply be sending the batch of operations to another node, without the need to share complex state between them. It means that the database server has all the required information and can make decisions based on it. For example, if there are no data dependencies, it can execute the operations in the transaction in whatever order it desires, leading to more optimal execution time. The database can also mix &amp; match operations from different transactions into a single batch (as long as it keeps the externally visible behavior consistent, of course) to optimize things even further.There are two major disadvantages for batch mode. The first of which is that there is usually a strict separation of reads from writes. That means that you usually can&#x2019;t get a single consistent read/modify operation that stay in the same transaction. The second issue is similar, because you need to generate all the operations ahead of time, you can&#x2019;t make decisions about what operations to execute based on the data you read, at least not in the same transaction. The typical solution for that is to send a script in the batch. This script can then read / modify data in the same context, apply logic, etc. The important thing here is that this script runs inside the server, already inside the transaction. This means that you don&#x2019;t pay network round trips time to make such operations. On the other hand, it means that you need to write potentially complex logic in the database&#x2019;s scripting language, rather than your own platform, which you&#x2019;ll likely prefer. Luckily, for most scenarios, especially with web applications, you don&#x2019;t need to execute complex logics on the server side. You can usually just send the commands you need in a single batch and be done with it. Often, just have optimistic concurrency is enough to get you the consistency you want, with scripting reserved for more exceptional cases. RavenDB&#x2019;s usage scenario was meant to make the common operations easy and the hard stuff possible. I think that we got it right and ended up with an API that is functional, highly performant and one that has withstood the test of time very well.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When we start building a feature, we often have a pretty good idea of what we want to have and how to get there. And then we actually start building it and we often end up with something that is quite different (and usually much better). It has gotten to the point where we aren&#x2019;t even trying to do hard specs and detailed design at anything beyond the exploratory levels. For example, in the design of RavenDB 4.0, there was not even a mention of RQL. That ended up being a very late addition to the codebase, but it improved RavenDB significantly. On the other hand, the low level mechanisms of zero copy documents from Voron all the way to the network were designed up front, but only at a fairly high level.In this post, I want to talk about query parameters in RavenDB. Actually, let me be more specific, we have query parameters, but what we don&#x2019;t have (or rather, didn&#x2019;t have, because that will be merged in by the time you read this post) is the ability to run parameterized queries from the studio. We always meant to have that capability, but we run out of time with the 4.0 release. As we are gearing up to the 4.1 release, we are cleaning the table from the major-minor issues. (Major in term of impact, minor in term of amount of work required). The query parameters in the studio is one such example. Here is what this looks like:My first thought was to just build something like this:Give the user the ability to define arguments and be done with it. The task was assigned to one of our developers and I expected to get a PR in a short while. This particular developer has a tendency to consider not just the task at hand but also other aspects of the problem. He didn&#x2019;t want the user to have to manually specify each argument, since that has poor ergonomics. Instead, he wanted the studio to figure it out its own and help the user. So the first thing he did was detect the arguments (regex: &#x201C;\$\w&#x2B;&#x201D;) and present them in the grid. Then there was the issue of how to deal with edits, etc. Then he run into another problem, types. Query parameters can be more than just strings, they can be any JSON data type. Here is what he came up with:Instead of having to define the query parameters in a separate location, just put them right in. Having the parameters grid involves pointing and clicking with the mouse, entering possibly complex values (such as long arrays) and in general much more work than just having them right above the query.Note that this is a studio only feature, queries from the client API already have ways to specify arguments properly. So the next question is how we are going to handle passing the arguments to the server. Remember, this is only on the studio, so we can take quite a few shortcuts. In this case, we&#x2019;ll simply snip the entire first section of the query text (which contains the query parameters). We can do that by going from the start of the query to the first from or declare keywords. We do a basic pre-processing to turn &#x201C;$name = &#x2026;&#x201C; into &#x201C;results.$name = &#x2026;&#x201C; and then just execute this code in the browser, giving us a JS object with all the parameters that we can then send to the servers.The next stage is to make this discoverable, by detecting parameters whose value is not provided and giving the user a quick fix to add them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We had a bug. If a certain method was called, we would do something very bad. Here is the fix for this issue:Basically, we assumed that the passed pointer is a char pointer and not a UTF8 byte pointer. That led to horrible mess down the line, including the fact that the length was pass to the constructor is twice the size of the actual allocated memory.In rare cases, that would be enough to push us to the next page of memory. If that page of memory wasn&#x2019;t mapped, we would die with an access violation.There is just one problem with this scenario. We never called this method in our codebase. This method was implicitly called by the debugger to show nice strings. Which meant that during debugging, sometimes, we would corrupt our own state and end up killing ourselves. For fun, this is the kind of error that literally cannot be debugged.</p>
