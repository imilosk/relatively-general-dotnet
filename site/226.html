In this case, there are a few things that we want to pay special attention to. First, there are about 3GB of free space and we are seeing a lot of fragmented blocks. Depending on your actual GC settings, you might be expecting some of it. We typically run with Server mode and RetainVM, which means that the GC will delay releasing memory to the operating system, so in some cases, a high amount of memory in the process isn&#x2019;t an issue, but you need to see its order. If you are looking at the WinDBG output and seeing hundreds of thousands of fragments, it means that the GC will need to work that much harder when allocating. And it means that it can&#x2019;t really compact memory and optimize things for higher locality, prevent their promotion to a higher GC gen, etc. This is also usually the result of pinned memory, typically for I/O or interop. This can cause small buffers that are pinned all over the heap, but most I/O systems are well aware of that and use various tricks to avoid this. Typically by allocating large enough buffers so they would reside in the Large Object Heap, which doesn&#x2019;t gets compacted very often (if ever). If you are seeing something like this in your application, the first thing to check is the number of pinned buffers and instances you are seeing. In our case, we intentionally made a change to the system that had the side affect to pin small buffers in memory for a long time, mostly to see how bad that would be. This was to see if we could simplify buffer management somewhat. The answer was that this is quite bad, so we had to manage the buffers more proactively. We allocate a large buffer on the large object heap, then slice it into multiple segments and pool these segments. This way we get small buffers that aren&#x2019;t wasting a lot of memory, but avoid high memory fragmentation because they have to be pinned for longish periods.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">About 15 years ago I got a few Operating Systems books and started reading them cover to cover. They were quite interesting to someone who was just starting to learn that there is something under the covers. I remember thinking that this was a pretty complex topics and that the operating system had to do a lot to make everything seem to go.The discussion of memory was especially enlightening, since the details of what was going on behind the scene of the flat memory model we usually take for granted are fascinating. In this post, I&#x2019;m going to lay out a few terms and try to explain how the operating system sees it and how it impacts your application.The operating system needs to manage the RAM, and typically there is also some swap space that is available as well to spill things to. There is also mmap files, which come with their own backing store, but I&#x2019;m jumping ahead a bit.Physical memory &#x2013; The amount of RAM on the device. This is probably the simplest to grasp here.Virtual memory &#x2013; The amount of virtual memory each process can access. This is different between each process and quite different from how much memory is actually in used.Reserved virtual memory &#x2013; a section of virtual memory that was reserved by the process. The only thing that the operating system needs to do is not allocate anything within this range of memory. It comes with no other costs. Trying to access this memory without first committing it will cause a fault.Committed virtual memory &#x2013; a section of virtual memory that the process has told the operating system that they intend to use. The operating system commits to having this memory when the process actually uses it. The system can also refuse to commit memory if it choses to do so (for example, because it doesn&#x2019;t have enough memory for that).Used virtual memory &#x2013;&#xA0; a memory section that was previously committed from the operating system and is actually in use. When you commit memory, that isn&#x2019;t actually doing anything. Only when you access the memory will the OS actually assign a physical memory page for that memory you just accessed. The distinction between the last two is quite important. It is very common to commit far more memory than is actually in use. By not actually taking any space until it is used, the OS can save a lot of work. Memory mapped files &#x2013; a section of the virtual address space that uses a particular file as its backing store.Shared memory &#x2013; a named piece of memory that may be mapped into more than a single process. All of these interact with one another in non trivial manners, so it can sometimes be hard to figure out what is going on.The interesting case happens when the amount of memory we want to access is higher than the amount of physical RAM on the machine. At this point, the operating system needs to start juggle things around and actually make decisions.Reserving virtual memory is mostly a very cheap operation. This can be used if you will want some contiguous memory space but don&#x2019;t need all of it right now. On 32 bits, the address space is quite constrained, so that can fail, but on 64 bits, you typically have enough memory address space that you don&#x2019;t have to worry about it.Committing virtual memory is where we start getting into interesting issues. We ask the operating system to ensure that we can access this memory, and it will typically say yes. But in order to make that commitment, the OS needs to look at its global state. How many other commitment did it make? In general, the amount of memory commitments that the OS can safely do is limited to the size of the RAM plus the size of the swap. Windows will simply refuse to allocate more (but it can dynamically increase the size of the swap as load grows) but Linux will happily ignore the limit and rely on the fact that applications will rarely actually make use of all the memory they are committing. So committed memory is counted against the limit, but it isn&#x2019;t memory that is actually in use. When a process is accessing memory, only then will the OS allocate that memory for it, until then, it is just a ledger entry.But the memory on your machine is not just stuff that processes allocated. There are a bunch of other stuff that may make use of the physical memory. There are I/O bound devices, which we&#x2019;ll ignore because they don&#x2019;t matter for us at this point.But of much more interest to us at this point is the notion of memory mapped files. These are most certainly memory resident, but they aren&#x2019;t counted against the commit size of the system. Why is that? Because when we use a memory mapped file, by definition, we are also supplying a file that will be the backing store for this memory. That, in turn, means that we don&#x2019;t need to worry about where we&#x2019;ll put this memory if we need to evict some for other purposes, we have the actual file.All of this, of course, revolves around the issue of what will actually reside in physical memory. And that leads us to another very important term: Active working set &#x2013; The portion of the process memory that resides on the physical RAM. Some portions of the process memory may have been paged to disk (if the system is overloaded or if it has just mapped a file and haven&#x2019;t access the contents yet). The actual term refer to the amount of memory that the process has recently been using, and under load, the working set may be higher then the amount of memory actually in use, leading to thrashing. The OS will keep evicting pages to the page file and then loading them again, in a vicious cycle that typically kills the machines. Now that we know all these terms, let&#x2019;s take a a look at what RavenDB reports in some case:The total system memory is 8 GB (about 200MB are reserved for the hardware). RavenDB is using 5.96GB and the machine entire memory usage is 1.95GB.&#xA0; How can a single process in the machine use more memory than the entire machine?The reason for that is that we aren&#x2019;t always talking about the same thing. Here is the output of pertinent memory information from this machine (cat /proc/meminfo).You can see that we have a total memory of 8GB, but only 140MB are free. In active use we have 2.2GB and a lot of stuff in inactive.There is also the MemAvailable field, which says that we have 6.2GB available. But what does this means? It is a guesstimate of how much memory we can start using without starting to swap. Taking the values from top, it might be easier to understand:There are about 6GB of cached data, but what is it caching? The answer is that RavenDB is making use of memory mapped files, so we gave the system extra swap space, so to speak. Here is what this looks like when looking at the RavenDB process:In other words, large parts of our working set is composed of memory mapped files, and we don&#x2019;t want to try to account that against the actual memory being in use in the system. Because it is very common for us to operate with almost no free memory, because that memory is being used (by the memory mapped files) and the OS knows that it can just make use of this memory if new demands comes in.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A user reported that when running a set of unit tests against a RavenDB service running on a 1 CPU, 512MB Docker machine instance they were able to reliably reproduce an out of memory exception that would kill the server.They were able to do that by simply running a long series of pretty simple unit tests. In some cases, this crashed the server.It took a while to figure out what the root cause was. RavenDB unit tests are run on isolated databases, with each test having their own db. Running a lot of these tests, especially if they were short, will effectively create and delete a lot of databases on the server.So we were able to reproduce this independently of anything by just running the create/delete database in a loop and the problem became obvious. Spinning and tearing down a database are pretty big things. Unit tests asides, this is not something that you&#x2019;ll typically do very often. But with unit tests, you may be creating thousands of them very rapidly. And it looked like that caused a problem, but why?Well, we had hanging references to this databases. There were two major areas that caused this:Timers of various kinds that might hang around for a while, waiting to actually fire. We had a few cases where we weren&#x2019;t actually stopping the timer on db teardown, just checking that if the db was disposed when the timer fired. Queues for background operations, which might be delayed because we want to optimize I/O globally. In particular, flushing data to disk is expensive, so we defer it as late as possible. But we didn&#x2019;t remove the db entry from the flush queue on shutdown, relying on the flusher to check if the db was disposed or not.None of these are actually really leaks. In both cases, we will clean up everything eventually. But while that happens, this keeps a reference to the database instance, and prevent us from fully releasing all the resources associated with it. Being more explicitly about freeing all these resource now, rather than waiting a few seconds and have them released automatically made a major difference in this scenario. This was only the case in such small machines because the amount of memory they had was small enough that they run out before they could start clearing the backlog. On machines with a bit more resources, everything will hum along nicely, because we had enough spare capacity.</p>
