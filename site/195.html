            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB 4.x is using X509 Certificates for authentication. We got a feedback question from a customer about that, they much rather to use API Keys, instead.We actually considered this as part of the design process for 4.x and we concluded that we can make this work in just the same manner as API Keys. Here is how you can make it work.You have the certificate file (usually PFX) and convert that to a Base64 string, like so:[System.Convert]::ToBase64String( (gc &quot;cert.pfx&quot; -Encoding byte ) )You can take the resulting string and store it like an API key, because that is effectively how it is treated. In your application startup, you can use:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.&#xA;      Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;              Show hidden characters&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          store.Certificate = new X509Certificate( Convert.FromBase64String( certificateString ) );&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          store.init.cs&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;And this is it. For all intents and purposes, you can now use the certificate as an API key.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last week we had a couple of interesting milestones. The first of which is that we reached the End Of Life for RavenDB 3.0. If you are still running on RavenDB 3.0 (or any previous version), be aware that this marks the end of the support cycle for that version. You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to RavenDB 3.5 (which still has about 1.5 years of support).I got an email today from a customer talking about maybe considering upgrade from the RavenDB version that was released in Dec 2012, so I&#x2019;m very familiar with slow upgrade cycles. End of Life for 3.0 means that we no longer offer support for it. If your operations team is dragging their feet on the upgrade, please hammer this point home. We really want to see people running on at least 3.5. The other side of the news is that the new bits for RavenDB 4.2 Release Candidate are out. This release moves out of the experimental phase features such as Cluster Wide Transactions and Counters and introduce Graph Queries support. As usual, I would really love your feedback.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A decade(!) ago&#xA0; I wrote that you should avoid soft deletes. Today I run into a question in the mailing list and I remembered writing about this, it turned out that there has been quite the discussion on this at the time.&#xA;&#xA;My post on avoiding soft deletes&#xA;Richard&#x2019;s post on the trouble data deletion cause&#xA;Udi&#x2019;s post about never deleting data&#xA;Dare&#x2019;s post summarizing most of the discussion&#xA;&#xA;The context of the discussion at the time was deleting data from relational systems, but the same principles apply. The question I just fielded asked how you can translate a Delete() operation inside the RavenDB client to a soft delete (IsDeleted = true) operation. The RavenDB client API supports a few ways to interact with how we are talking to the underlying database, including some pretty interesting hooks deep into the pipeline.&#xA;What it doesn&#x2019;t offer, though, is a way to turn a Delete() operation into and update (or an update to a delete). We do have facilities in place that allow you to detect (and abort) on invalid operations. For example, invoices should never be deleted. You can tell the RavenDB client API that it should throw whenever an invoice is about to be deleted, but you have no way of saying that we should take the Delete(invoice) and turn that into a soft delete operation.&#xA;This is quite intentionally by design.&#xA;Having a way to transform basic operations (like delete &#x2013;&gt; update) is a good way to be pretty confused about what is actually going on in the system. It is better to allow the user to enforce the required behavior (invoices cannot be deleted) and let the calling code handle this different.&#xA;The natural response here, of course, is that this places a burden on the calling code. Surely we want to be able to follow DRY and not write conditionals when the user clicks on the delete button. But this isn&#x2019;t an issue where this is extra duplicated code.&#xA;&#xA;An invoice is never deleted, it is cancelled. There are tax implications on that, you need to get it correct.&#xA;A payment is never removed, it is refunded.&#xA;&#xA;You absolutely want to block deletions of those type of documents, and you need to treat them (very) different in code.&#xA;In the enusing decade since the blog posts at the top of this post were written, there have been a number of changes. Some of them are architecturally minor, such as the database technology of choice or the guiding principles for maintainable software development. Some of them are pretty significant.&#xA;One such change is the GDPR.&#xA;&#x201C;Huh?!&#x201D; I can imagine you thinking. How does the GDPR applies to an architectural discussion of soft deletes vs. business operations. It turns out that it is very relevant. One of the things that the GDPR mandates (and there are similar laws elsewhere, such as the CCPA) the right to be forgotten. So if you are using soft deletes, you might actually run into real problems down the line. &#x201C;I asked to be deleted, they told me they did, but they secretly kept my data!&#x201D;.&#xA0; The one thing that I keep hearing about the GDPR is that no one ever found it humorous. Not with the kind of penalties that are attached to it.&#xA;So when thinking about deletes in your system, you need to consider quite a few factors:&#xA;&#xA;Does it make sense, from a business perspective, to actually lose that data? Deleting a note from a customer&#x2019;s record is probably just fine. Removing the record of the customer at all? Probably not.&#xA;Do I need to keep this data? Invoices are one thing that pops to mind.&#xA;Do I need to forget this data? That is the other way, and what you can forget and how can be really complex.&#xA;&#xA;At any rate, for all but the simplest scenarios, just marking IsDeleted = true is likely not going to be sufficient. And all the other arguments that has been raised (which I&#x2019;m not going to repeat, read the posts, they are good ones) are still in effect.</p>

Asked to review it, most people would point out the lack of error handling if the request fails. I asked on twitter about this and got some good answers, see here.In practice, to make this piece of code production worthy you&#x2019;ll need a lot more code and infrastructure:.NET specific - ConfigureAwait(false) to ensure this works properly with a SynchronizationContext.NET specific &#x2013; Http Client caches Proxy settings and DNS resolution, requiring you to replace it if there is a failure / on a timer..NET specific &#x2013; Exceptions won&#x2019;t be thrown from Http Client if the server sent an error back (including things like auth failures).Input validation &#x2013; especially if this is exposed to potentially malicious user input. A retry mechanism (with back off strategy) is required to handle transient conditions, but need either idempotent requests or way to avoid duplicate actions.Monitoring for errors, health checks, latencies, etc.Metrics for performance, how long such operations take, how many ops / sec, how many failures, etc.Metrics for the size of responses (which may surprise you).Correlation id for end to end tracing.Properly handling of errors &#x2013; including reading the actual response from the server and surfacing it to the caller / logs. Handling successful requests that don&#x2019;t contain the data they are supposed to.And these are just the stuff that pop to my head from looking at 10 lines of really simple code. And after you have done all of that, you are still not really production ready. Mostly because if you implemented all of that in the GetProductAsync() function, you can&#x2019;t really figure out what is actually going on.These kind of operation is something that you want to have to implement once, via the infrastructure. There are quite a few libraries which does robust service handling that you can use, and using that will help, but it will only take you part way toward production ready system.Let&#x2019;s take cars and driving as an example of a system. If you&#x2019;ll look at a car, you&#x2019;ll find that quite a bit of the car design, constraints and feature set is driven directly by the need to handle the failure mode. A modern car will have (just the stuff that is obvious and pops to mind):Drivers &#x2013; required explicit learning stage and passing competency test, limits on driving in impaired state, higher certification levels for more complex vehicles.Accident prevention: ABS, driver assist and seat belt beeps.Reduce injuries / death when accidents do happen &#x2013; seat belts, air bags, crumple zones.On the road &#x2013; rumble strips, road fence, road maintenance, traffic laws, active and passive enforcement.I&#x2019;m pretty sure that anyone who actually understand cars will be shocked by how sparse my list is. It is clear, however, that accidents, their prevention and reducing their lethality and cost are a part and parcel of all design decisions on cars. In fact, there is a multi layered approach for increasing the safety of drivers and passengers. I&#x2019;m not sure how comparable the safety of a car is to production readiness of a piece of software, though. One of the ways that cars compete with one another is on the safety features. So there is a strong incentive to improve there. That isn&#x2019;t usually the case with software.It usually take a few (costly) lessons about how much being unavailable costs you before you can really feel how much not being production ready costs you. And at this point, most people turn to error handling and recovery strategies. I think this is a mistake. A great read on the topic is How Complex System Fail, it is a great, short paper, highly readable and very relevant to the field of software development. I consider a system to production ready when it has, not error handling inside a particular component, but actual dedicated components related to failure handling (note the difference from error handling), management of failures and its mitigations. The end goal is that you&#x2019;ll be able to continue execution and maintain semblance of normalcy to the outside world. That means having dedicated parts of the system that are just about handling (potentially very rare) failure modes as well as significant impact on your design. and architecture. That is not an inexpensive proposition. it takes quite a lot of time and effort to get there, and it is usually only worth it if you actually need the reliability this provides.With cars, the issue is literally human lives, so we are willing to spend quite a lot of preventing accidents and reducing their impact. However, the level of robustness I expect from a toaster is quite different (don&#x2019;t go on fire, pretty much) and most of that is already handled by the electrical system in the house. Erlang is a good example of a language and environment that has always prioritized production availability. Erlang systems famously have 99.9999999% availability (that is nine nines). That is 32 milliseconds of downtime per year, which pretty much means less than the average GC pause in most systems. Erlang have a lot of infrastructure to support this kind of availability numbers, but that still require you to understand the whole system.For example, if your Erlang service depends on a database, a restart of a database server (which takes 2 minutes to cycle) might very well means that your service processes will die, will be restarted by their supervisors only to die again and again. At this point, the supervisors itself give up and die, passing the buck up the chain. The usual response is to restart the supervisor again a few times, but the database is still down and we are in a cascading failure scenario. Just restarting is really effective in handling errors, but for certain failure scenarios, you need to consider how you&#x2019;ll actually make it work. A database being unavailable can make your entire system cycle through its restarts options and die just as the database is back online. For that matter, what happens to all the requests that you tried to process at that time?I have had a few conversations that went something like: &#x201C;Oh, we use Erlang, that is handled&#x201D;, but production readiness isn&#x2019;t something that you can solve at the infrastructure level. It has a global impact on your architecture, design and the business itself. There are a lot of questions that you can&#x2019;t answer from a technical point of view. &#x201C;If I can&#x2019;t validate the inventory status, should I accept an order or not?&#x201D; is probably the most famous one, and that is something that the business itself need to answer. Although, to be honest, the most important answer that you need from the business is a much more basic one: &#x201C;Do we need to worry about production readiness, and if so, by how much?&#x201D;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m going to be talking at CodeNode in London on June 3rd. The topic of this talk is a few bugs that we found in the CoreCLR framework, the JIT and even the Operating System, how we tracked them down and put them down.I have blogged about some of these in the past, and I&#x2019;m looking forward to giving this talk. You can expect a talk that ranges between WinDBG walk throughs and rants about the memory model assumptions made on a different platform six years ago.</p>
