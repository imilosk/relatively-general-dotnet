            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, as it turns out, there are some things that you can do to make WebForms more palatable. Smart use of ITemplate and some additional magic can take you a fairly long way. I am still severely limited (splitting behavior between&#xA0;markup &amp; code behind is extremely annoying) in what I can do, but it &#xA0;is good to know that it is possible: &lt;rails:ConditionalRenderer runat=&quot;server&quot; &#xA;    Condition=&quot;&lt;%# ((Policy)Container.DataItem).Expired %&gt;&quot;&#xA;    DataItem=&quot;&lt;%# Container.DataItem %&gt;&quot; &gt;&#xA;    &lt;WhenTrue&gt;&#xA;        Policy has expired!&#xA;    &lt;/WhenTrue&gt;    &#xA;    &lt;WhenFalse&gt;&#xA;        Policy is valid until &lt;%# Eval(&quot;ExpiryDate&quot;) %&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/WhenFalse&gt;&#xA;&lt;/rails:ConditionalRenderer&gt;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;I am using it inside a repeater to keep the presentation logic in a single place.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;The code to make this happen is something like this (typed from memory, you need about 80 lines to get it right).&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;[ParseChildren(true)]&#xA;public class ConditionalRenderer : Control, INamingContainer&#xA;{&#xA;    public bool Condition { get { .. } set { .. } }&#xA;&#xA;    [Templatecontainer(ConditionalRenderer)]&#xA;    public ITemplate WhenTrue { get { .. } set { .. } } &#xA;    [Templatecontainer(ConditionalRenderer)]&#xA;    public ITemplate WhenFalse { get { .. } set { .. } }&#xA;&#xA;    public object DataItem { get { .. } set { .. } }&#xA;    &#xA;    public override void EnsureChildControls()&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (Condition)&#xA;            WhenTrue.InstansiateIn(this);&#xA;        else&#xA;            WhenFalse.InstansiateIn(this);&#xA;    }&#xA;}</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I would really like to understand the attidute behind &quot;no code* (TM) &quot; approach.  * Except a whole lot of of XML&#xA0;that you are not supposed to look at but usually have. &#xA0; The new announcement from Microsoft&#xA0;is hitting all the key points that scream &quot;STOP&quot; in my case: &#xA0;  Tomorrow you will build&#xA0;parts, behaviors, navigation, and even business logic (via Windows Workflow Foundation) all in a designer. You will even&#xA0;wire components&#xA0;and dependencies and define how they interact, all without writing or generating&#xA0;any code. I do&#xA0;believe that I have heard this promise before. About Object Oriented&#xA0;Programming, COM, XML, Web Services, SOA, etc. Being a developer is about telling the computer what to do. Trying to hide this behind a wizard is nice, but it is not an approach that scales, period. I am not going to program in this, but it looks like that is what I would need to do if I wanted to understand what is going on. &lt;CsamlFile xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/csaml&quot;&#xA;           xmlns:x=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;NamespaceDeclaration Identifier=&quot;MyNamespace&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;ClassDeclaration Identifier=&quot;MyClass&quot; &#xA;                          Access=&quot;Public&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;MethodDeclaration Identifier=&quot;Main&quot; &#xA;                               Access=&quot;Public&quot; &#xA;                               Modifier=&quot;Static&quot; &#xA;                               ReturnType=&quot;{x:Type void}&quot;&gt;&#xA;                &lt;InvocationExpression&#xA;                  MemberAccess=&quot;System.Console.WriteLine&quot;&gt;&#xA;                    &lt;InvocationExpression.ArgumentList&gt;&#xA;                        &lt;Literal Type=&quot;{x:Type string}&quot;&#xA;                                 Value=&quot;Hello, CSAML! &quot;&gt;&#xA;                    &lt;/InvocationExpression.ArgumentList&gt;&#xA;                &lt;/InvocationExpression&gt;&#xA;            &lt;/MethodDeclaration&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/ClassDeclaration&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/NamespaceDeclaration&gt;&#xA;&lt;/CsamlFile&gt; &#xA;Oh wait, there is a designer? &#xA;Nice,&#xA0;I saw how that turned out for SSIS, BizTalk, etc when we are talking about even moderate complexity. How do I debug it? There is a special tool? How do I profile it? There is nothing for that?&#xA;Can we please stop trying to run away from code? If I want declerative language, I will write a DSL, and it sure as hell wouldn&#x27;t be in XML.&#xA;I am all for smarter frameworks and making our life easier, but I am completely against trying to get to: &quot;all without writing or generating&#xA0;any code&quot;&#xA;Newsflash: XML is code, period.</p>

C# 3.0 adds some interesting features, and extension methods, initializers, etc will significantly improve the expressiveness of the language. Even now, I can see the limitations that even C# 3.0 will give us. But on the other hand, I fully expect some interesting developments in taking the capabilities of the language and pushing them forward.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It looks like a lot of people are not familiar with this, and that is a shame. Recently we have run into several instances where we wanted to do some things that are not supported out of the box by the repeater. Specifically, render an empty template and render&#xA0;markup after each row, except the first one, etc. After some time thinking about how easy it would be to do this in MonoRail, I decided to implement it in the same way I would in MonoRail. WebForms has the concept of an ITemplate, a piece of markup/code that can be handed to a control for later processing. For the MonoRail guys, think about it like a section in a component. By defining &lt;EmptyTemplate&gt; and &lt;NotFirstRowTemplate&gt; - I have been able to get it to work very easily. The only problematic part was where to render the template, but some reflectorring has given me the answer to that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Full disclosure, I have received a personal license for Visual SVN (49$) from the developers on Visual SVN, since they are apparently doing a lot of stuff with Rhino Mocks and wanted to show it. About a month ago I installed Visual SVN, and then I promptly forgot about it. When the evaluation period has ended, I found myself thinking, &quot;Wait a minute, I really like this tool.&quot; Visual SVN works by extending Visual Studio with the same interface as TortoiseSVN, which means that it is instantly usable for anyone that have used TortoiseSVN (basically most developers on Windows that use SVN). The nice thing about it is that you really don&#x27;t feel that something different, until it is taken away. I have grown accustomed to the green/orange lights, and I like the ability to right click and &quot;show changes&quot;. I am still using TortoiseSVN to do a lot of stuff from explorer, but it is very nice to be able to do them from the IDE. The options that it offers directly of the right click menu are a subset of what you can do in Tortoise SVN, but it is a close match for the things that I want to be able to do in the IDE, so I have no issue with it. The thing that drove me insane for a few minutes was a menu item being renamed from the Tortoise SVN terminology that I just skipped over, but that is the only issue that I have found. As you probably know, I have great reservations about putting things in the IDE, mostly because I usually find that they make me wait for them (unacceptable). But Visual SVN is different in this regard because I literally can&#x27;t find any issues with the IDE integration, the things that I do (solution wide namespace rename, done yesterday) are immediately reflected and I didn&#x27;t notice any slow down.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Evan Hoff&#xA0;has an eye opening post about the results of putting simple business logic in the database. Go read it, now. Now, after you have read that, let me continue with Rob&#x27;s reply&#xA0;to my previous post: It&#x27;s in the extreme, when you throw more and more code at a complex issue rather than use a simpler approach (like a view or SP) that the ORM model breaks. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve run into this - you must have. I disagree in part, since it all depends on what do you define as extreme. Using OR/M opens new levels of extremeness with regards to the DB and queries. A few days ago I spend a few hours writing a query using NHibernate that I would never ever write in SQL, because it would be so much work to handle that. Obviously there are things that the DB does best, and for that, I have other options, including views or SP, but I use those through the OR/M, so I maintain my domain. Overall, If you document what you&#x27;re doing, is there really a question in terms of maintainability? Absolutely. I can give you well documented code that it an absolute nightmare to develop with. It may be performant, but it wouldn&#x27;t let you do anything with it. Case in point, a coworker had decides that he wants to &quot;save&quot; page load times by not using user controls in a WebForms application. He still needed to generate dynamic HTML. He put the dynamic HTML in a resource file, read it into a static variable, and then built the HTML using string.Format(). There is a chance that it is more performant solution that just using user controls, and there was a clear line of reasoning leading to this behavior, but the maintainability concerns were:  Non standard way of doing something, completely threw me off when I looked at the page. Ugly code that I couldn&#x27;t understand. Presentation logic &amp; HTML Generation are two separate concerns that were mixed together You had to restart the application if you wanted to change the HTML in the resource file (static variable for caching) Guess what happens for other cultures? No syntax highlighting or designer support for the HTML This is only from a few minutes of thinking about it. I have not profiled the differences, but I believe that they are minute if any, but even if it had significant advantage, the maintainability concerns are simply too important. I&#x27;ll throw a cache at the page and still be faster than anything hand optimized can get to. I&#x27;ve seen ORM tools completely written out of many applications because of perf issues, supportability (no one knew how to use them) and, oddly enough, maintenance nightmares You can use any tool badly, so I can&#x27;t really comment on this unless I have more information. Perf issues are not inherent to OR/M by no means, but it is certainly possible to use OR/M to create performance issues. The same is true for maintainability in OR/M, it is not a given if you use OR/M, only easier. I apologize if this comes off wrong, but if you worked at the companies I worked for you&#x27;d be fired for this comment. &quot;Just buy more hardware so I can code this way&quot;. This line of thinking is sooooo completely dev-centric that all I can do is wonder &quot;did he really just say that&quot; I didn&#x27;t have the chance of working on something in the order of PayPal or eBay, but I still disagree. There is a point in which the answer &quot;throw more hardware&quot; at it breaks, that is usually when you hit the physical constraints of the data center. Nevertheless, I think we are confusing performance and scalability here. Performance is how fast I can do something, scalability is how many concurrent somethings I can do. For the most part, I would worry about scalability more than performance. Cheap web machines and caching as a scalability measure is one of the easiest routes to scalable applications, and as Evan has pointed out, even minor business logic handling in the database can completely break this model and leaves you with scaling out from the database, which is not a good thing. So, let me try that comment again:  I can scale up faster and bigger and have more ability to change the application using this approach, rather than spending the time shaving milliseconds now and not being able to respond to change in three months time because of the optimizations that I did now. I&#x27;ll add one final thing - you guys are assuming that all &quot;good engineers&quot; out there know and understand NHibernate. In your view does knowledge of NHibernate factor into maintenance? And if not, how can this NOT be construed as a &quot;one off&quot; position? I do not assume that all good engineers know &amp; understand NHibernate. I do assume that it is possible to pick up NHibernate in a week or so. Knowledge about NHibernate is simple a pre-requisite for the application, much like knowledge of SQL is. NHibernate is not a &quot;one off&quot; approach because it is not something that is built for this particular project, it is a&#xA0;general framework with a wealth&#xA0;of knowledge, support,&#xA0;community, etc.&#xA0; Oh, and did I said that you really want to read Evan&#x27;s post</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just read this&#xA0;about the SQL Server 2008 features, and I thought to provide my own commentary on the new features:  Declarative Management Framework - not really interesting to me. Table Value Parameters - YEAH, that is more like it. There are too many cases when I need to use IN on a large data set and I run into the 2100 parameters limitations. This is going to make working with this so much easier. MERGE&#xA0; SQL Statement - I got tired of writing my own Update/Insert very early. This also means that the tools will support it as well, probably (SSIS), so that makes my life easier still. Change Data Capture - Hm, that looks interesting in the abstract, will probably want to check that out. Star Join Query Optimizations - not really interesting yet. There is also the EDM stuff that they are apparently putting there, which is also interesting, but not likely to be usable unless you are using the Entity Framework. The announcement about that was very vague.</p>

Trying to get the sort of syntax that you see about is really stretching C# to its limits. When can I get a Method Missing implementation&#xA0;on C#? That would actually make my life easier?</p>
