        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We released RavenDB Cloud a few months ago, with great response from the community. Since the cloud offer was released, we have been silently working on more features and capabilities.Many of them you&#x2019;ll never even notice. We have integrated RavenDB monitoring and RavenDB Cloud&#x2019;s capability to do live deploys, for example, so your RavenDB Cloud can do things like dynamically grow its disk size at need or the RavenDB instance can alert that it is running out of IOPS and upgrade its IOPS reservation, etc.Some of the new features, on the other hand, are quite visible. To increase the security of our users, you can now enable two factor authentication for your account. Just go to your Profile inside of the RavenDB Cloud Portal and you&#x2019;ll see the option:At this point, I don&#x2019;t think that I need to really say anything more about why 2FA is such an important feature and I encourage all our users to enable it in their accounts.Speaking of accounts, a hotly requested feature was the ability to have multiple users per account. We have implemented this and you can now invite users to your account.The common scenario for this is when you need to have the ops team as a whole have access to the organization&#x2019;s RavenDB Cloud. This saves the need to have a shared user and give a much better experience for larger organizations.We are actively working on our cloud offering, but with a few months to look back, I&#x2019;m really happy about where we are. If you have any suggestions or requests, I would love to hear them.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I care about usability and the user experience for our users. We spend a lot of time on making sure that things are running smoothly. When we created RavenDB Cloud, I knew that it was important to create a good experience for our cloud offering. One of the most important things that I did was to go and look at other people&#x2019;s offerings and see where they failed to meet customer expectations. I recently run into this article about AWS Elastic. Similar issues has been raised about it for a while. And it was one of my explicit design goals of what not to do in our cloud offerings.Summarizing the discussion, it seems like the following major issues across the board.Backups &#x2013; Being able to have your own backup schedule and destinations. Retention policies based on your needs, etc. AWS Elastic uses hourly backups and you only get 14 days of that. Cosmos DB, to look at an Azure offering, is taking a backup every 4 hours and you have a maximum of two of them. We have users that needs to be able to go back weeks / months / years and look at the state of their database at a given point in time. The 8 hours backup period for Cosmos DB is really short, but even 14 days on AWS Elastic is short enough that you probably need to roll some other solutions for that.With RavenDB Cloud, you have automatic backups (hourly) with a retention period that defaults to 14 days. The key here, by the way, is defaults. You are absolutely free to define your own backup policies (per database or per cluster), that means that you can set your own destinations (want to do cross cloud backups, no problem) and your own retention policies. Visibility &#x2013; This is a very common complaint, it showed up in pretty much all resources that I checked and have been a common cause of complaints among the peers I sampled when we did the background for RavenDB Cloud. In particular, no logs or access to the debug endpoints is a killer for productivity. If you can&#x2019;t tell what the problem is, you can&#x2019;t fix it, so you&#x2019;ll need to call support and have someone look things over. Here are a few choice quotes, that I think goes to the heart of things.Here is Liz Bennett talking about things in 2017:I feel equipped to deal with most Elasticsearch problems, given access to administrative Elasticsearch APIs, metrics and logging. AWS&#x2019;s Elasticsearch offers access to none of that. Not even APIs that are read-only, such as the /_cluster/pending_tasks API. &#x2026;Without access to logs, without access to admin APIs, without node-level metrics (all you get is cluster-level aggregate metrics) or even the goddamn query logs, it&#x2019;s basically impossible to troubleshoot your own Elasticsearch cluster.&#x2026;AWS&#x2019;s Elasticsearch doesn&#x2019;t provide access to any of those things, leaving you no other option but to contact AWS&#x2019;s support team. But AWS&#x2019;s support team doesn&#x2019;t have the time, skills or context to diagnose non-trivial issuesAnd here is Nick Price, just a few days ago:So your cluster resize job broke (on a service you probably chose so you wouldn&#x2019;t have to deal with this stuff in the first place), so you open a top severity ticket with AWS support. Invariably, they&#x2019;ll complain about your shard count or sizing and will helpfully add a link to the same shard sizing guidelines you&#x2019;ve read 500 times by now. And then you wait for them to fix it. And wait. And wait. The last time I tried to resize a cluster and it locked up, causing a major production outage, it took SEVEN DAYS for them to get everything back online.&#x2026;They couldn&#x2019;t even tell if they&#x2019;d fixed the problem and had to have me verify whether they had restored connectivity between their own systems.I think that the reason this is the case is that AWS Elastic is a multi tenant service. so each instance is shared among multiple clients. That means that they have to limit the endpoints that you can access, to not leak data from other clients.With RavenDB Cloud, you get all the usual diagnostic features features that you would usually get. We don&#x2019;t want you to escalate things to support. The ideal scenario is that if you run into any trouble, you&#x2019;ll be able to figure things out completely on your own. Hell, we do active monitoring and will contact our customers if we see outliers in the system behavior to gives them a heads up. You can go to your RavenDB Cloud instance, pull the logs, watch ongoing traffic and even get a stack trace of the running production system. Everything is there, in the box.Flexibility &#x2013; The most common cited issue with AWS Elastic seems to be related to the issue of not being able to make changes in the environment. Or, rather, you can do that (increasing node count or changing the instance types) but when you do that, you are going to have a full blown migration step. That means that you&#x2019;ll double the number of nodes you&#x2019;ll run and incur a really expensive operation to copy all the data. Given that Elastic already has this feature (add a node to an existing cluster) the decision not to support it is likely related to constraints on the AWS Elastic multi tenancy layer.I&#x2019;m not really sure what to say here, RavenDB Cloud has no such issue. To be rather more exact, our multi tenant architecture was specifically designed so the outward facing differences between how you&#x2019;ll operate RavenDB on your own systems vs. how you&#x2019;ll operate RavenDB on the Cloud will be minimal.Adding and removing node is certainly possible. And in fact, in my intro video to RavenDB Cloud I showed how I can upgrade a cluster along multiple axes, while it is being actively written to. All with exactly zero interruptions in service. Client code that was busy reading and writing from the cluster didn&#x2019;t even noticed that. That was certainly not an easy feature to implement, but I considered this to be the baseline of what we had to offer.Support &#x2013; Both Nick and Liz had a poor experience with AWS Elastic support. You can read the quotes above, or read the full posts for the whole picture.I don&#x2019;t like support. We explicitly modeled the company so support is a cost center, not a source of revenue. That means that we want to close each support incident as soon as possible.&#xA0; What this doesn&#x2019;t mean is that we do an auto close of all issues on creation. That would give us fantastic closure rates, I imagine, but at a cost.Instead, we have a multi layered system to deal with things. Consider the scenario Nick run into, a full disk. That is certainly something that you might run into, no?Automatic recovery - With RavenDB,&#xA0; a single full disk will simply cause that node to reject writes, nothing else. And the cluster as a whole will continue to operate normally. With RavenDB Cloud, we have a lot more control, and our monitoring systems will automatically alert on disk full and increase its size automatically behind the scenes with no impact on users. Diagnostics - Active monitoring means that you&#x2019;ll be notified in the RavenDB Studio about suspicious issues (for example, you run out of IOPS) and be able to investigate them with full visibility. RavenDB does a lot of work to ensure that if something is broken, you&#x2019;ll know about it. Front line support &#x2013; if you need to call our support, the person answering the call is going to be able to help you. They would typically be an engineer that was involved either in the actual building / managing of RavenDB Cloud or (2nd tier) involved in the development of RavenDB itself.My goal with a support call is to get you back to speed as soon as possible, and the usual metrics for that are measured in minutes, not days. We are now several months post the launch of RavenDB Cloud and the pickup of customers has been great. What is more important from my end, however, is that we are seeing how this kind of investment in our architecture and setup is paying off.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous posts in this series, I explored a bit how to generate a full text index on top of the Enron data set. In particular, we looked at (rudimentary) analysis of text in the first post and looked into posting lists (list of matching documents for specific terms) in the second one. It occurred to me that we need to actually have a much better understanding of the kind of requirements that we have from posting lists in general, so let&#x2019;s look at them, shall we?Add to the list (increasing numbers only).Iterate the list (all, or from starting point).Reduce disk space and memory utilization as much as possible.The fact that I want to be able to add to the list is interesting. The typical use case in full text search is to generate the full blown posting list from scratch every time. The typical model is to use LSM (Log Structure Merge) and take advantage on the fact that we are dealing with sorted list to merge them cheaply.Iterating the list is something you&#x2019;ll frequently do, to find all the matches or to merge two separate lists. Here is the kind of API that I initially had in mind:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

I initially thought about using this an the baseline of a couple of test implementations using StreamVByte, FastPFor as well as Gorrilla compression. The problem is that there is the need to balance compression ratio with the cost of actually going over the list. Given that my test cases showed a big benefit for using Roaring Bitmaps, I decided to look at them first and see what I can get out of it.RoaringBitamps is a way to store (efficiently) a set of bits, they are very widely used in the industry. The default implementation is also entirely suitable for my purposes. Mostly because they make use of managed memory, and a hard requirement that I have placed on this series is that I want to be able to use persistent memory. In other words, I want to be able to write the data out, then be able to do everything on top of memory mapped data, without having to parse it.Roaring Bitmaps works in the following manner. Each 64K range of integers is divided into each own 8KB segments. Given that I&#x2019;m using Voron as a persistence library, these numbers don&#x2019;t work for my needs. Voron uses an 8KB page size, so we&#x2019;ll drop these numbers by half. Each range will be 32K of integers and take a maximum of 4KB of disk space. This allows me to store it much more efficiently inside of Voron. Each segment, in turn, has a type. The types can be either:Array &#x2013; if the number of set bits in the segment is less than 2048, the data will use a simple sorted array implementation, with each value taking 2 bytes.Bitmap &#x2013; if the number of set bits in the segment is between 2048 and 30,720, the segment will use a total of 4096 bytes and be a standard bitmap.Reversed array &#x2013; if the number of set bits in the segment is higher than 30,720, we&#x2019;ll store in the segment the unset bits as a sorted array.This gives us quite a few advantages:It is straightforward to build this incrementally (remember that we only ever add items in the end).It is quite efficient in terms of space saving in the case of sparse / busy usage.It is cheap (computationally) to work with and process.It is very simple to use from memory mapped file without having to parse / create managed objects.The one thing that we still need to take into account is how to deal with the segment metadata. How do we know what segment belong to what range. In order to handle that, we&#x2019;ll define the following:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

The start location (is always going to be a multiple of 32K) and the number of set bits (which has a maximum of 32K). Therefor, we can pack all of them into a single int64. The struct is merely there for convenience. In other words, in addition to the segments with the actual set bits, we are also going to have an array of all the segment&#x2019;s metadata. In practice, we&#x2019;ll also need another value here, the actual location of the segment&#x2019;s data, but that is merely another int64, so that is still very reasonable.As this is currently a mere exercise, I&#x2019;m going to skip actually building the implementation, but it seems like it should be a fairly straightforward approach. I might do another post about how to actually implement this feature on Voron, because it is interesting. But I think that this is already long enough.We still have another aspect to consider. So far, we talked only about the posting lists, but we also need to discuss the terms. But that is a topic for the next post in the series.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In full text search terminology, a posting list is just a list of document ids. These are used to store and find matches for particular terms in the index.I took the code from the previous post and asked it to give me the top 50 most frequent terms in the dataset and their posting lists. The biggest list had over 200,000 documents, and I intentionally use multiple threads to build things, so the actual list is going to be random from run to run (which adds a little more real-worldedness to the system*).*Yes, I invented that term. It make sense, so I&#x2019;m sticking with it.I took those posting lists and just dumped them to a file, in the simplest possible format. Here are the resulting files:There are a few things to note here. As you can see, the file name is the actual term in the index, the contents of the file is a sorted list of int64 of the document ids (as 8 bytes little endian values).I&#x2019;m using int64 here because Lucene uses int32 and thus has the ~2.1 billion document limit, which I want to avoid. It also make it more fun to work with the data, because of the extra challenge.&#xA0; The file sizes seems small, but the from file contains over 250,000 entries. When dealing with posting lists, size matter, a lot. So let&#x2019;s see what it would take to reduce the size here, shall we?Simply zipping the file gives us a massive space reduction, so there is a lot left on the table, which is great. Actually, I might have skipped a few steps:Posting lists are sorted, because it helps do things like union / intersect queries.Posting lists are typically only added to.Removal are handled separately, with a merge step to clean this up eventually.Because the value is sorted, the first thing I tried was to use a diff model with variable sized int. Here is the core code:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Variable sized integers are used heavily by Lucene, so I&#x2019;m very familiar with them. But there are other alternatives.StreamVByte is a new one, with some impressive perf numbers, but only gets us to 282 KB (but it is possible / likely that my implementation of the code is bad).FastPFor compresses the (diffed) data down to 108KB. RoaringBitmap gives us a total of 64KB.There are other methods, but they tend to go to the esoteric and not something that I can very quickly test directly. It is important to note that there are several separate constraints here:Final size on diskComputational cost to generate that final formatComputation cost to go from the final format to the original valuesHow much (managed) memory is required during this processThat is enough for now, I believe. My next post will deal delve into the actual semantics that we need to implement to get a good behavior from the system. This is likely going to be quite interesting.</p>
