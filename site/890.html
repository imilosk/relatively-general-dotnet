            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A little over six months ago, Visual Studio was release. At the time of the release, there was a big ruckus  about the quality of the release. Shortly before the release, there were quite a few bugs that were closed with Won&#x2019;t Fix, and many people run into issues with it that were time consuming at best.&#xA;Because of all the problems, a service pack was promised in the first half of the year. At the moment, the information I could find suggests September as the due date. This is worrying since beyond Web Application Projects, there hasn&#x2019;t been anything out from Microsoft to fix many of the issues that came up, and I don&#x2019;t believe that they are going for a short beta cycle with this.&#xA;Six months after release, I got a different view of the product than I had at release time, so here is my current thinking in the matter.&#xA;The Good:&#xA;It looks much slicker than VS 2003. &#xA;Debugger visualizes &amp; hovering over and object and getting its values is a killer feature. &#xA; I love class diagrams. For someone who talks about code like I do, class diagrams are an excellent tool .&#xA;No, this is not a mistake. Those are the good things that I see in VS 2005 over 2003. Keep in mind that I am talking about the IDE, not the framework.&#xA;The Bad:&#xA;It is slow. Opening the toolbox take half a minute or more, opening the server explorer is something that require a coffee break. Working with the code can be very frustrating as well, sometimes I can see the code repainting. &#xA;It is a memory hog. I often sees it soaring quickly over 250Mb after a few minutes of use in a big project. This means that I literally can&#x2019;t use two instances of it at the same time unless I&#x2019;m on a 2Gb machine.  This is really annoying, since it means that I can&#x2019;t use it for quickly spiking some stuff.&#xA;It hung, often. I think that today I killed VS over fifteen time, and it is not abnormally high (although it is high). I usually have to kill it two or three times a day on a 1Gb machine (much less on my 2Gb machine). Trying to use source control integration just kills it. But just opening a large project and using the IDE for a few hours can do it just as well. &#xA;The New Item Dialog has very strange ideas about keyboard shortcuts. This dialog has a very strange ideas about what starts with an A, for instance. I want to add a new App.Config file to a project, I can&#x2019;t just tap &#x2018;A&#x2019; a couple of times until it reach the app.config icon. It just ignores some of the items in the dialog, some of the time.&#xA;The edit &amp; continue nonsense. I want to edit my code at debug time, it should allow me to do so than display a useless dialog box asking me what I want to do. If I&#x2019;m using Web Application Projects, it just doesn&#x2019;t let me edit the file, and only God knows why.&#xA;I&#x2019;m not even going to try to dig deep into each of those issues, with scenarios where this caused me to lose time and work. This is a high level overview of the problems, and I wish that I could say that it was a problem in my machine.&#xA;I once stole several hours on a 64bit, 32Gb, 4 way machine  to do some development on, and I can&#x2019;t say that I found the experience much different than using on in a much less powered machine. &#xA;I also see the same problems at client sites. I am often told &#x201C;Let it finish thinking&#x201D;, and I see people alt tabbing between applications while VS does something that locks the IDE.&#xA;I am not used to having to wait for the computer, nor do I intend to get use to it.&#xA;It has been six months,  enough time to learn the quirks of the IDE, and maybe work around them. I still don&#x2019;t see VS 2005 as a satisfying IDE, although it is the best there is for .Net right now (which isn&#x2019;t saying much actually, there are only 2 IDEs for .Net that I know of, and the other one is an open source effort that doesn&#x2019;t have nearly enough resources).&#xA;What is you experience?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Looks like the Web 2.0 thing has gotten even some spammer. Now they are personalizing their stuff, and it is actually quite good.&#xA;For the past couple of days, I got two spam messages, one with &#x201C;NHibernate&#x201D; on the title, and the second with &#x201C;.NET Lucene&#x201D;. Both of those looked suspicious to my filters, but the title got them out of purgatory. I was pissed of the learn that I have been had, and they went directly back to purgatory again.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, here I am, trying to work on a Team System project using VPN. If I were using VSS, I would have known that there are going to be problems with this, but I expected much better experience from Team System.&#xA;I can&#x2019;t get it to work. Each and every time I try to open the project, it pulls all the changes from the server and hung. 100% repeatable,200% annoying. The only way that I can get it to work is by disconnecting from the network, and then opening the project, which means that I work disconnected, which mean that when / if I could work through this, I would need to do some more manual work with this to merge the changes back.&#xA;What is worse, I can&#x2019;t get the IDE to open without the source control binding. It shouldn&#x2019;t be hard to do, I set the source control provide to none, it should not try to out-guess me and do nasty stuff behind my back like this.&#xA;I&#x2019;m on eBay at the moment , ordering a dozen chicken for a dark moon ceremony, perhaps this will help.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, it looks like I&#x2019;m back to making daily releases of Rhino Mocks.  Royston Shufflebotham has been bombarding me with patches, this new releases contains:&#xA;A lot more overloads for multi mocks, including the ability to use multi mocks with partial mocks and being able to creates multi mocks with constructor arguments.&#xA;Can now call CallOriginalMethod() from LastCall as well as Expect.&#xA;A way to disambiguate between properties with the same name from different interfaces with constraints.&#xA;Some better debug information for those of us who debug Rhino Mocks.&#xA;A big thanks to Royston, who has been doing a lot lately to give Rhino Mocks even more great capabilities. Source and binaries are in the usual place.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">About ten months ago I managed to put Rhino Mocks (version 2.3.3) at 100% testability. That was the last time that I checked this, and since them I had many releases.&#xA;I checked it today, out of curiosity if nothing else, and I was surprised to discover that I still got an absurdly high level of tested code, 95% of Rhino Mocks are tested. The rest of the 5% are utility methods and the like, which I&#x2019;m not going to worry much about.&#xA;The last change I did involved changing the way Rhino Mocks created mocks. This is about as important a change as you can make.  This amount of testing gives me the ability to make a significant change to Rhino Mocks and still be certain that I am not breaking anything when I do it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I need to make a radical change to an application. This change is basically ripping apart a major piece of the infrastructure and replacing it with another piece, which has a different API, usage and capabilities.&#xA;I&#x2019;m currently thinking about how I should do it. I got tests for the code, of course, but I don&#x2019;t know how I can move it to the other infrastructure with the tests intact. My worry is that I can make the move, and then break each and every tests that relies on the infrastructure to exists (~140 tests, I think). This is a big problem because I will need to change both tests and code just in order to get the code to compile again.&#xA;I&#x2019;m not going to remove the tests, since they test functionality that is needed for the application, so  at the end of the conversion, I know that I am at the same point that I was before I started all of this.&#xA;If anyone has any ideas, I would love to hear them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Because, I didn&#x2019;t have an inflammatory post in nearly two days, and I&#x2019;m feeling faint &#xA;Anyway, I&#x2019;m working at the moment at a highly Microsoft focused client. Which means that they consider the Enterprise library as Mana From Heaven.  This forced me to raise from my own pile of tools and take a look at the Enterprise Library.&#xA;I can&#x2019;t say that I am overly impressed. Here is my quick summary:&#xA;NameOpinionConfigurationNot sure why we will need this now. There are strongly typed accessors for configuration, and they are flexible enough to do whatever I need. If I need to pull the configuration out of the database, I can do this  in one line of code (using Active Record). &#xA;If I need to do complex configuration, including object graphs, I will either use a data base and Active Record, which make it a breeze, XML Serialization or just rethink what I&#x2019;m trying to do. &#xA;For me, all those lengthy configuration files are death-by-XML.InstrumentationThey mention event log, performance counters and WMI events. I&#x2019;m not sure why the event log is in instrumentation, and I&#x2019;m clueless with regard to WMI events, but why do we need another layer on top of performance counters?&#xA;I just did a project that required some heavy use of performance counters, and the API couldn&#x2019;t really be simpler.Object BuilderThere is something very wrong in Microsoft building their own IoC container. &#xA;The Object Builder looks like a reasonable implementation of Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control container, but I don&#x2019;t see any reason to use it except that it got &#x201C;Microsoft&#x201D; in its name. LoggingAgain, I have a problem with this, mainly because of log4net. It was there first, after all. Why do the same thing again?Data AccessI got NHibernate, enough said  &#xA;This looks like a whole lot of work to get what I have seen Oren Ellenbogen do in about five minutes and 15 LoC using delegates.Exception ManagementThis one I like in concept, but not in practice. The problem that I have with this is code such as this: &#x201C;if(ExceptionPolicy.HandleException(ex,&#x201D;Foo&#x201D;)) throw;&#x201D; This presume that under some circumstance I will want to swallow an exception.  This kind of stuff gives me ticks. You have no idea how big a bug-fest can get when such a thing is happening. Errors are vanished into the night, and so is sanity, soon after.&#xA;What is interesting about the exception handling is that it supposed to prevent you from leaking sensitive data to remote callers on error conditions. It is a notable goal, I just got a design problem with solving the problem this way.&#xA;Depending on the application, I would either hook an OnError event (ASP.Net) or provide a service  decorator that handles this (web services / Remoting).&#xA;Beyond that, I suspect everything that has boilerplate code in it.&#xA;The real problem is that all the things that it is trying to achieve are not something that could change safely without affecting all calling code. CachingThis one looks cool. A durable cache that survives application restarts is something very interesting. Of the top of my head, the only kind of applications that I would use this is for partially connected applications, like smart clients, etc. A cache is something that takes care &amp; feeding, not something that you can just  use without thinking about.&#xA;(Cache invalidation policies, for instance. Concurrency issues, etc. ) &#xA;I would generally not bother with those issues unless I had a partially connectivity scenarios.CryptographyUm, why? None of the services that they offer can&#x2019;t already be had from the framework in five lines of code tops.SecurityIt looks nice, but I don&#x2019;t know enough on the subject to talk. &#xA;&#xA0;One thing that annoys me about the Enterprise Library is that at least two of the core components are duplication of outside effort. I can think of at least two well known logging framework for .Net (log4net &amp; NLog ), both of which existed before the Logging Application Block saw the light of day. I can&#x2019;t think of all the IoC containers for .Net, and that is because there are so many of them. &#xA;I got an issue with this because it creates an artificial segmentation of the tools. As far as I can say, those tools were not created because of some need that Microsoft could not meet using the open source equivalents. Nor because of some licensing issues (like NAnt / MSBuild) since most of the IoC containers for .Net as well as log4net are free for the taking. Including for commercial use.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I said it before, but I just have to say it again. It is a big mistake to release software. Any time that I do it, I need to make a new release soon after. (And no, not a bug fix release {usually} ).&#xA;Yet I did make the mistake of releasing the most dangerous software of them all, Rhino Mocks. The moment I do something to this beast, a new feature request come up. The problem is that I&#x2019;m a sucker for frequent releases, I just can&#x2019;t help implement features and ship them. &#xA;This release brings one major feature to the table, Multi Mocks. What is a Multi Mock? &#xA;A Multi Mock is a mock object that implements several interfaces. For instance, you may want to test this code:&#xA;public&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;void CleanCollection(CollectionBase collection)&#xA;{&#xA;    collection.Clear();&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;IDisposable disposable = collection as&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;IDisposable;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;if(disposable!=null)&#xA;        disposable.Dispose();&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA0;As you can see, we accept a collection, and we make sure to dispose of it if it is disposable. CollectionBase does not implements IDisposable, so this would usually force us to create a dummy class to make the MockRepository think that we need all those interfaces. &#xA;Instead, we can now do this:&#xA;[Test]&#xA;public&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;void ClearCollectionAndDisposesIt()&#xA;{&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;MockRepository mocks = new&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;MockRepository();&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;CollectionBase collection = (CollectionBase)mocks.CreateMultiMock(&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;typeof (CollectionBase), typeof (IDisposable));&#xA;    collection.Clear();&#xA;    ((IDisposable)collection).Dispose();&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA0;    mocks.ReplayAll();&#xA;    CleanCollection(collection);&#xA;    mocks.VerifyAll();&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA0;There is also a DynamicMultiMock, with the same behavior. The functionality exists with generic overloads for 2.0, of course.  Oh, I also added AtLeastOnce to the default options for repeating. I was asked to do this a long time ago, and I just forgot.&#xA;You can read the feature request here. This is also very useful in Remoting scenarios.&#xA;By my calculations, it is less than 6 hours from the feature request to shipping a well tested version out the door.  Take that, Test Driven Development naysayers!  As usual, you can get both binaries and source here.&#xA;Thanks against for Royston Shufflebotham for presenting such a clear need.</p>
