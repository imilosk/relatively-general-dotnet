            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There are actually several reasons for that, not the least of which is that I like working on OSS projects. But there is also another reason for that, which is very important for adoption:     Joel Spolsky have an interesting article about just this topic.     When I sit down to architect a system, I have to decide which tools to use. And a good architect only uses tools that can either be trusted, or that can be fixed. &quot;Trusted&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that they were made by some big company that you&#x27;re supposed to trust like IBM, it means that you know in your heart that it&#x27;s going to work right. I think today most Windows programmers trust Visual C&#x2B;&#x2B;, for example. They may not trust MFC, but MFC comes with source, and so even though it can&#x27;t be trusted, it can be fixed when you discover how truly atrocious the async socket library is. So it&#x27;s OK to bet your career on MFC, too.    You can bet your career on the Oracle DBMS, because it just works and everybody knows it. And you can bet your career on Berkeley DB, because if it screws up, you go into the source code and fix it. But you probably don&#x27;t want to bet your career on a non-open-source, not-well-known tool. You can use that for experiments, but it&#x27;s not a bet-your-career kind of tool.   I have used the same logic myself in the past, and I think it is compelling.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, I got a lot of exposure about my recent post about the actual costs of saving a few bytes from the fields names in schema-less databases. David has been kind enough to post some real numbers about costs, which I am going to use for this post.  The most important part is here:     We have now moved to a private cloud with Terremark and use Fibre SANs. Pricing for these is around $1000 per TB per month.     We are not using a single server &#x2013; we have 4 servers per shard so the data is stored 4 times. See why here. Each shard has 500GB in total data so that&#x2019;s 2TB = $2000 per month.   So, that gives a price point of 4 US Dollars per gigabyte.  Note that this is a pre month cost, which means that it is going to cost a whopping of 48$ per year. Now, that is much higher cost than the 5 cents that I gave earlier, but let us see what this gives us.   We will assume that the saving is actually higher than 1 GB, let us call it 10 GB across all fields across all documents. Which seems a reasonable number.  That thing now costs 480 $per year.  Now let us put this in perspective, okay?  At 75,000$ a year (which is decidedly on the low end, I might add), that comes to less than 2 days of developer time.  It is also less than the following consumer items     The cheapest iPad - 499$    The price of the iPhone when it came out - 599$   But let us talk about cloud stuff, okay?     A single small Linux instance on EC2 &#x2013; 746$ per year.   In other words, your entire saving isn&#x2019;t even the cost of adding the a single additional node to your cloud solution.  And to the nitpickers, please note that we are talking about data is is already replicated 4 times, so it already includes such things as backups. And back to the original problem. You are going to lose more than 2 days of developer time on this usage scenario when you have variable names like tA.  A much better solution would have been to simply put the database on a compressed directory, which would slow down some IO, but isn&#x2019;t really important to MongoDB, since it does most operations in RAM anyway, or just implement document compression per document, like you can do with RavenDB.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that some people fear in a distributed source control is that they might run into conflicts all the time.  My experience has shown that this isn&#x2019;t the case, but even when it is, there isn&#x2019;t really anything really scary about that.  Here is an example of a merge conflict in Git:    Double click the conflicting file, and you get the standard diff dialog. You can then resolve the conflict, and then you are done.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I found myself reading this post, and at some point, I really wanted to cry:     We had relatively long, descriptive names in MySQL such as timeAdded or valueCached. For a small number of rows, this extra storage only amounts to a few bytes per row, but when you have 10 million rows, each with maybe 100 bytes of field names, then you quickly eat up disk space unnecessarily. 100 * 10,000,000 = ~900MB just for field names!    We cut down the names to 2-3 characters. This is a little more confusing in the code but the disk storage savings are worth it. And if you use sensible names then it isn&#x2019;t that bad e.g. timeAdded -&gt; tA. A reduction to about 15 bytes per row at 10,000,000 rows means ~140MB for field names &#x2013; a massive saving.   Let me do the math for a second, okay?  A two terabyte hard drive now costs 120 USD. By my math, that makes:     1 TB = 60 USD    1 GB = 0.058 USD   In other words, that massive saving that they are talking about? 5 cents!  Let me do another math problem, oaky?  Developer costs about 75,000 USD per year.     (52 weeks &#x2013; 2 vacation weeks) x 40 work hours = 2,000 work hours per year.    75,000 / 2,000 = 37.5 $ / hr    37.5 / 60 minutes = 62 cents per minutes.   In other words, assuming that this change cost a single minute of developer time, the entire saving is worse than moot.  And it is going to take a lot more than one minute.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Update: Fixed decimal placement error in the cost per minute. Fixed mute/moot issue. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;To those of you pointing out that real server storage space is much higher. You are correct, of course. I am trying to make a point. Even assuming that it costs two orders of magnitudes higher than what I said, that is still only 5$. Are you going to tell me that saving the price of a single cup of coffee is actually meaningful?&#xA;&#xA;To those of you pointing out that MongoDB effectively stores the entire DB in memory. The post talked about disk size, not about memory, but even so, that is still not relevant. Mostly because MongoDB only requires indexes to fit in memory, and (presumably) indexes don&#x27;t really need to store the field name per each indexed entry. If they do, then there is something very wrong with the impl.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the more powerful features of RavenDB is the notion of indexes. Indexes allow you to query RavenDB efficiently and they stand at the core of RavenDB&#x2019;s philosophy of &#x201C;we shall never make you wait&#x201D; and they are the express way to a lot of RavenDB&#x2019;s capabilities (spatial searches and full text searches, to name just a few).  Unfortunately, indexes require that you pre-define them before you can use them. That led to a problem. A big one. It meant that in addition for simply deploying RavenDB, you had to manage additional assets, the index definitions. In essence, that is very similar to having to worry about the database schema.&#xA0; That, in turn, made deploying that bit more complex, and that was unacceptable.   So we implemented the Code Only Indexes, which allow you to define your indexes as part of your project, and have them automatically created the first time the application starts.  Defining the indexes is pretty simple:     public class Movies_ByActor : AbstractIndexCreationTask&lt;Movie&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    public Movies_ByActor()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = movies =&gt; from movie in movies&#xA;                        select new {movie.Name};&#xA;        Index(x=&gt;x.Name, FieldIndexing.Analyzed);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public class Users_CountByCountry : AbstractIndexCreationTask&lt;User&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    public Users_CountByCountry()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = users =&gt; from user in users&#xA;              select new {user.Country, Count = 1};&#xA;        Reduce= results =&gt; from result in results&#xA;                           group result by result.Country into g&#xA;                           select new { Country = g.Key, Count = g.Sum(x=&gt;x.Count)}&#xA;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;But this is just the first step, the next is to tell RavenDB about them:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  IndexCreation.CreateIndexes(typeof(Movies_ByActor).Assembly, store);&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;If you put this in your Global.asax, you would never have to think about indexing or deployment issues again.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the pieces of feedback that we got from people frequently enough to be annoying is that the requirement to define indexes upfront before you can query is annoying. For a while, I thought that yes, it is annoying, but so is the need to sleep. And that there isn&#x2019;t anything much you can do about it.  Then Rob and asked, why do we require users to define indexes when we can gather enough information to do this ourselves? And since I couldn&#x2019;t think of a good reason why, he went ahead and implemented this.     var activeUsers = from user in session.Query&lt;User&gt;()&#xA;                  where user.IsActive == true&#xA;                  select user;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;You don&#x2019;t have to define anything, it just works. &#xA;&#xA;There are a few things to note, though.&#xA;&#xA;First, unindexed queries are notorious for working on small data sets and killing systems in production. That was one of the main reasons that I didn&#x2019;t want to run &#xA;&#xA;Moreover, since RavenDB philosophy is that it should make it pretty hard to shoot yourself in the foot, we figured out how to make this efficient.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  RavenDB will look at the query, see that there is no matching index, and create one for you.&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    Currently, it will create an index per each query type. In the future (as in, by the time you read this, most probably) we will have a query optimizer that can deal with selecting the appropriate index.&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;  Those indexes are going to be temporary indexes, maintained for a short amount of time.&#xA;&#xA;  However, if RavenDB notice that you are making a large number of queries to a particular index, it will materialize it and turn it into a permanent index.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;In other words, based on your actual system behavior, RavenDB will optimize itself for you :-) !&#xA;&#xA;This feature actually had us stop and think, because it fundamentally changed the way that you work with RavenDB. We actually had to stop and think why you would want to create indexes manually.&#xA;&#xA;As it turned out, there are still a number of reasons why you would want to do that, but they become far more rare:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  You want to do apply complex filtering logic or do something to the index output. (For example, you may be interested in aggregating several fields into one searchable item)&#xA;&#xA;  You want to use RavenDB&#x2019;s spatial support.&#xA;&#xA;  Aggregations still require defining a map/reduce query.&#xA;&#xA;  You want to use the Live Projections feature, which I&#x2019;ll discuss in my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into this question, and I thought that this is an important enough topic to put it on the blog as well.      A cursory dig suggests CouchDB is more mature, with a larger community to support it. That aside, what do you consider to be the significant differences?    RavenDB was heavily inspired by CouchDB. But when I sat down to build it, I tried to find all the places where you would have friction in using CouchDB and eliminating them, as well as try to build a product that would be a natural fit to the .NET ecosystem. That isn&#x27;t just being able to run easily on Windows, btw. It is about being a product that fits the thought processes, requirements and environment in which it is used.  Here are some of the things that distinguish RavenDB:     Transactions - support for single document, document batch, multi request, multi node transactions. Include support for DTC. To my knowledge, CouchDB supports transaction only on a single document.    Patching - you can perform a PATCH op against a document, instead of having to send the entire document to the server.    Set based operations - basically, a way to do things like: &quot;update active = false where last_login &lt; &#x27;2010-10-01&#x27;&quot;    Deployment options - can run embedded, separate executable, windows service, iis, windows azure.    Client API - comes with a client API for .NET that is very mature. Supports things like unit of work, change tracking, etc.    Safe by default - both the server and the client have builtin limits (overrdable) that prevent you from doing things that will kill your app.    Queries - Support the following querying options:         Indexes - similar to couch&#x27;s views. Define by specifying a linq query.       Just do a search - doesn&#x27;t have to have an index. RavenDB will analyze the query and create a temporary index for you. However, unlike couch temp views. This is meant for production use. And those temp indexes will automatically become permanent ones based on usage. Note that you don&#x27;t have to define anything, just issue the actual query: Name:ayende will give you back the correct result. Tags,Name:raven will also do the same, including when you have to deal with extracting information directly from the composite docs.       Run a linq query - this is similar to the way temp view works, it is an O(n) operation, but it allows you to do whatever you want with the full power of linq. (For the non .NET guys, it allows you to run a SQL query against the data store) Mostly meant for testing.       Index backing store - Raven puts the index information in Lucene, which means we get full text searching OOTB. We can also do spatial queries OOTB.    Searching - It is very easy to say &quot;index users by first name and last name&quot;, then search for them by either one. (As I understand it, I would have to define two separate views in couch for this).    Scaling - Raven comes with replication builtin, including master/master. Sharding is natively supported by the client API and requires you to simply define your sharding strategy.    Authorization - Raven has an auth system that allows defining queries based on user / role on document, set of documents (based on the doc data) and globally. You can define something like: &quot;Only Senior Engineers can Support Strategic Clients&quot;    Triggers - Raven gives you the option to register triggers that will run on document PUT/READ/DELETE/INDEX    Extensibility - Raven is intended to be customized by the user for typical deployment. That mean that you would typically have some sort of customization, such as triggers, additional operations that the DB can do.    Includes&#xA0; &amp; Live projections -&#xA0; Let us say that we have the following set of documents: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;ayende&quot;, &quot;partner&quot;: &quot;docs/123&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;arava&quot; }         Includes means that you can load the &quot;ayende&quot; document, while asking RavenDB to load the document referred to by the partner property. That means that you have only a single request to make, vs. 2 of them without this feature.      Live projections means that we can ask for the document name and the name of the partner&#x27;s name. Effectively joining the two together.              Those two features will only work on local data, obviously.      And I am probably forgetting some stuff, to be honest. Oh, and I am naturally the most unbiased of observers :-)</p>
