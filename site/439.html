            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The following represent a stream of thoughts while I was refactoring the replication behavior for RavenDB. It may not be very meaningful, since I am mostly using this to sort things out in my head. Previously in RavenDB, we created what are known as tombstone documents in RavenDB to represent deleted documents. That caused problem under some specialized conditions (if you had a lot of deletes, you had a lot of tombstone documents to go through). So we changed the way we store tombstone documents to use a separate list that isn&#x2019;t part of the document storage.  That means that now we need to update the part that accepts a replication request and have it understand what is going on. This is a bit complex because, ignoring concurrency, we have the following states:  Item does not exist in the current database.   Item was deleted (mark it as deleted? leave it alone?)  Item was created/updated (persist it) Item was deleted locally.   Item was deleted (should we generate a conflict if the history is not similar?)  Item was created/updated (should generate a conflict if the history isn&#x2019;t consistent). Item exists locally:   Item was deleted (need to check for history for conflicts).  Item was created/updated (need to check for history for conflicts). Item was modified locally.   Item was deleted (need to check for history for conflicts).  Item was created/updated (need to check for history for conflicts). Item is conflicted:   Item was deleted (generate conflict).  Item was created/updated (generate conflict). We also need to make sure that we have the right behavior when you load a conflicted document, which make for interesting behavior when you have conflicts with deleted documents. The first thing to do was to actually simply things, instead of having all of those options, I decided to branch early, so we would have one branch for when we replicate a delete and one branch when we replicate a create/update.  Replicating delete  Item does not exists &#x2013; ignore Item is conflicted &#x2013; add to the conflicts (save as standard tombstone document, not as a separate item. That makes it possible to handle the client side conflict resolution easily). Item was deleted locally &#x2013; merge histories and do not generate conflict even if there is difference. Item wasn&#x2019;t modified locally &#x2013; delete it Item was modified locally &#x2013; create conflict There were actually to major decisions that made it drastically simpler. The first was to have the delete yes/no branching early. The second is more subtle, but probably even more important. The reason for this change was to remove the cost of storing the deleted tombstones as documents. The problem is what to do when we are actually getting a conflict. Previously, we would save the conflict into the document store, and that would be accessible using the standard RavenDB tooling. But how do you store a conflict between a deleted item and a locally modified item? I decided that for that specific scenario, we are going to continue storing them as documents. That means that externally, nothing will change. This drastically reduced the complexity in the codebase and the problem set that I had to resolve. Everything now works, and we are good to go.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is another stream of conciseness post, with me trying to figure out what is the best way to resolve a given problem.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Update: I ended up solving this in a drastically different way. I&#x27;ll post about this later on. I am keeping this here because it is a good post about how I think about a problem.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;A while ago, I posted a visual description of how Map/Reduce is supposed to work. That was while I was working on RavenDB map/reduce implementation, but that isn&#x2019;t actually how the current RavenDB map/reduce works.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Instead, it works like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Map phase:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;for item in docs:&#xA;   for result in reduce(map(item)):&#xA;        Persist(item.id, result.key, result)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And the reduce phase:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;for result in reduce(results):&#xA;     WriteToIndex(result)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;There are a few things that are interesting here.&#xA0; First, we have both map and reduce run during the map phase, why is that?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Well, to do an immediate reduction of the values, of course. This has two major benefits.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;It means that in the reduce phase, the reduce accepts the output of the reduce &#x2013; this is important because it prepare us for the next step that we would have to do, multiple reduce steps.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Second, it means that if you have multiple results from the same documents that share the same key, they would be reduced immediately, rather than have multiple results with the same key.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You might notice an issue with the code above, though. It seems like we are only running reduce once, and only once.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Indeed, this is how RavenDB 1.0 behaves. It only run the reduce once, regardless of how many entries you have per key.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Wait! I probably need to explain things. Let us talk for a second about the following map/reduce index:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;//map&#xA;from order in docs.Orders&#xA;from line in order.OrderLines&#xA;select new&#xA;{&#xA;   line.Product,&#xA;   line.Qty&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;//reduce&#xA;from result in results&#xA;group result by result.Product into g&#xA;select new&#xA;{&#xA;    Product = g.Key,&#xA;    Qty = g.Sum(x=&gt;x.Qty)&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Now, if we have an order with two line items for the same product, they would be immediately reduced (on the same document) and saved as the map results.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Now, the reduce key in this case is the line item product. So when we execute the reduce, we load all the map results that share the same reduce key and run them through the reduce function together.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;As I said, this is how RavenDB 1.0 behaves. And it works really nicely, except that it behave less nicely if you have a lot of results for the same reduce key. What happen if we had a really popular product, that was purchased by a million different order?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Every time that we would get a new order for this product, we would have to re-reduce the entire set. That means that we would have to re-reduce 1 millions items.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We recently got a problem when one of our customers run into an issue with running map/reduce indexes over the entire US census data. One of the problematic indexes was something like:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;//map &#xA;from person in docs.CensusPeople&#xA;select new&#xA;{&#xA;  person.State,&#xA;  Count = 1&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;//reduce&#xA;from result in results&#xA;group result by result.State into g&#xA;select new&#xA;{&#xA;  State = g.Key,&#xA;  Count = g.Sum(x=&gt;x.Count)&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;As you can imagine, this sort of thing is going to have a lot of items for the same key.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;For example, for California, we would need to run reduce over about 38 million items, and for Texas it would be over 25 million items. This is really not what we had in mind, so we turned to a long standing bug in RavenDB and started to implement multi step reduce.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The issue is how to do so. Ideally, we do not want to have to make any changes between map/reduce indexes that have a large number of items per key and map/reduce indexes that have small number of indexes per key.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The question is how to do this, and how to make sure that we don&#x2019;t affect the overall system performance. As I mentioned before, it is very easy to modify things to fit one particular scenario, while forgetting all about the other scenarios.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Things get interesting after that, and here is where you might get lost, because this part is mostly written from the point of view of the implementers.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The actual behavior of the system in the map phase is more complex, because we need to invalidate old items, it looks more like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;for item in docs:&#xA;   keys = DeleteMapResultsFor(item.id)&#xA;   for result in reduce(map(item)):&#xA;           keys.Remove(result.key)&#xA;        Persist(item.id, result.key, result)&#xA;   ReReduceRemovedKeys(keys)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Instead of this, we will have this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;for item in docs:&#xA;   result = DeleteMapResultsFor(item.id)&#xA;   keys = new HashSet&lt;string&gt;(result.Select(x=&gt;x.Key))&#xA;   lookups = result.ToLookup(x=&gt;new {x.id, x.key})&#xA;&#xA;   for result in reduce(map(item)):&#xA;           keys.Remove(result.key)&#xA;           int bucketId&#xA;           if not lookups.TryFind(new { item.Id, result.key}, out bucketId):&#xA;               bucketId = -1&#xA;        Persist(item.id, result.key, bucketId, result)&#xA;   ReReduceRemovedKeys(keys)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Note that we now have the notion of a bucket, and by default that bucket is set to &#x2013;1. But note that we keep the same bucketId if it already has one, this will be important later on.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The interesting thing happens in the reduce phase:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;def Reduce(string key, int level):&#xA;    bool hasMore =  true&#xA;    bool hadMore = false&#xA;    while hasMore:&#xA;        results = GetMappedResults(key, level, out hasMore)&#xA;        hadMore |= hasMore&#xA;        if hasMore:&#xA;            newBucketId = GetNewBucketId(key, level)&#xA;            UpdateBucketId(results, newBucketId)&#xA;        for result in reduce(results):&#xA;                Persist(key, level &#x2B;1, result)&#xA;                if not hadMore:&#xA;                    WriteToIndex(key, result)&#xA;    if hadMore:&#xA;        ScheduleReduce(key, level &#x2B;1)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is where the important things happen. If we have less than 1,024 items for the same key, we just proceed normally, there is nothing to see there.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;If we have more than that, then we create a bucket for all of those results and schedule a re-reduce for the next level up.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In other words, it looks like this, here it the map phase, notice that we start out with all of the bucket ids being &#x2013;1.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;When running the reduce phase with level = 0, we get three buckets, like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Which we now need to re-reduce again, this is where we are called with level = 1. Let us assume that the results of bucket 1 &amp; 2 are over 1,024 still, so we will have:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And finally:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;So far, this looks nice, but there are several practical problems that we still need to solve.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;To start with, when does this end? We have users who write map/reduce queries like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;//map #1&#xA;from customer in docs.Customers&#xA;select new &#xA;{&#xA;   CustomerId = customer.Id,&#xA;   CustomerName = customer.Name,&#xA;   OrderId = (string)null,&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// map #2&#xA;from order in docs.Orders&#xA;select new&#xA;{&#xA;  order.CustomerId,&#xA;  CustomerName = (string)null,&#xA;  OrderId = order.Id&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;//reduce&#xA;from result in results&#xA;group result by result.CustomerId into g&#xA;let name = g.FirstOrDefault(x=&gt;x.CustomerName!=null).CustomerName&#xA;from item in g&#xA;select new&#xA;{&#xA;   CustomerId = g.Key,&#xA;   CustomerName = name,&#xA;   item.OrderId&#xA;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This is a frowned upon (but working) way of allow you to query and sort by the customer name while searching for indexes. The problem with this method is that if we have 15,000 orders per customer, we are going to have the same number come out of the reduce phase as well.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Now, the reason this is frowned upon? Because while this is using map/reduce, it isn&#x2019;t actually&#x2026; you know.. reducing the data. In order to resolve this issue, we are going to make sure that all of the items generated from a single reduce step will always go into the same bucket. This will mean that we keep pretty much the same behavior as we have now, it is going to be inefficient, but that was always going to be the case.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;We are also going to limit the number of levels to three, which still gives us the ability to handle over a billion results before a reduce phase would need to see more than 1,024 items at once.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Take the California example, we would have 37,691,912 people, each of them reduce to 37,691,912 map results at bucket &#x2013;1. Then we have 36,809 buckets for the second level. And finally 35 levels at the third level. All of which are computed for the final result.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The next step from here is to actually handle updates, which means that we have to keep track of the bucket ids going forward, so we start with deleting a person, which means that we need to delete their map result. Which means that we need to re-reduce the bucket they belong to at the appropriate level, and then upward, etc. In total, we would have to compute 1,024 &#x2B; 1,024 &#x2B; 35 items, instead of 37,691,912.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Okay, enough talking, let us see if I straighten things out enough for me to actually be able to implement this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I don&#x2019;t believe that I ever did this, but I was just completely blown away by Skills Matter. Please note, I never actually dealt with them as a student, although I got great feedback from the people I taught about them in that capacity. I am talking here solely about dealing with them as a service provider. I have been working with them since 2008, and we have a great working relationship. I am routinely dealing with many businesses, and almost always you have this&#x2026; friction. I usually have great rapport with the technical people with whom I work, but then it comes to dealing with other departments, it can be&#x2026; annoying. With Skills Matter, not only was it never the case. They go out of their way to make it easy and fun to work for them.&#xA0; I can&#x2019;t talk about the &#x201C;straw that broke the camel&#x2019;s back&#x201D; and was the trigger for this post, but I can talk about some other things. From spreading the word about RavenDB and NHibernate by organising talks with me for the Skills Matter community to helping me with a payment dispute that I had with a hotel (that I reserved, but they took care of all the details of getting my money back and saved me tons of international calls an angst) to being willing and able to accommodate screw ups (oops, I missed the plane) in the most pleasant way possible and all the stuff they do for the developer community. In my time working with them, I found them to be honest, hardworking, professional, ethical and in general Very Good People.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There is a chance that you&#x2019;ll look at me strangely for calling this the &#x201C;Feature of the Day&#x201D;. But that is actually quite a important little feature.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is the deal, let us say that you have the following index:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public class Orders_Search : AbstractIndexCreationTask&lt;Order, Orders_Search.ReduceResult&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    public class ReduceResult&#xA;    {&#xA;        public string Query { get; set; }&#xA;        public DateTime LastPaymentDate { get; set; }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public Orders_Search()&#xA;    {&#xA;        Map = orders =&gt; from order in orders&#xA;                        let lastPayment = order.Payments.LastOrDefault()&#xA;                        select new&#xA;                        {&#xA;                            Query = new object[]&#xA;                            {&#xA;                                order.FirstName, &#xA;                                order.LastName, &#xA;                                order.OrderNumber, &#xA;                                order.Email, &#xA;                                order.Email.Split(&#x27;@&#x27;),&#xA;                                order.CompanyName,&#xA;                                order.Payments.Select(payment =&gt; payment.PaymentIdentifier),&#xA;                                order.LicenseIds&#xA;                            },&#xA;                            LastPaymentDate = lastPayment == null ? order.OrderedAt : lastPayment.At&#xA;                        };&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And you are quite happy with it. But that is the client side perspective. We don&#x2019;t have any types on the server, so you can&#x2019;t just execute this there. Instead, we send a string representing the index to the server. That string is actually the output of the linq expression, which looks like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This is&#x2026; somewhat hard to read, I think you&#x2019;ll agree. So we had some minimal work done to improve this, and right now what you&#x2019;ll get is (you&#x2019;ll likely see it roll off the screen, that is expected):&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;docs.Orders&#xA;    .Select(order =&gt; new {order = order, lastPayment = order.Payments.LastOrDefault()})&#xA;    .Select(__h__TransparentIdentifier0 =&gt; new {Query = new System.Object []{__h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.FirstName, __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.LastName, __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.OrderNumber, __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.Email, __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.Email.Split(new System.Char []{&#x27;@&#x27;}), __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.CompanyName, __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.Payments&#xA;    .Select(payment =&gt; payment.PaymentIdentifier), __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.LicenseIds}, LastPaymentDate = __h__TransparentIdentifier0.lastPayment == null ? __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.OrderedAt : __h__TransparentIdentifier0.lastPayment.At})&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;This is still quite confusing, actually. But still better than the alternative.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;As I said, it seems like a little thing, but those things are important. An index in its compiled form that is hard to understand for a user is a support issue for us. We needed to resolve this issue.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The problem is that source code beautifying is non trivial. I started playing with parsers a bit, but it was all way too complex. Then I had an epiphany. I didn&#x2019;t actually care about the code, I just wanted it sorted. There aren&#x2019;t many C# code beautifiers around, but there are a lot for JavaScript.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I started with the code from http://jsbeautifier.org/, which Rekna Anker had already ported to C#. From there, it was an issue of making sure that for my purposes, the code generated the right output. I had to teach it C# idioms such as @foo, null coalescent and lambda expressions, but that sounds harder than it actually was. With that done, we go this output:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;docs.Orders.Select(order =&gt; new {&#xA;    order = order,&#xA;    lastPayment = order.Payments.LastOrDefault()&#xA;}).Select(__h__TransparentIdentifier0 =&gt; new {&#xA;    Query = new System.Object[] {&#xA;        __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.FirstName,&#xA;        __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.LastName,&#xA;        __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.OrderNumber,&#xA;        __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.Email,&#xA;        __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.Email.Split(new System.Char[] {&#xA;            &#x27;@&#x27;&#xA;        }),&#xA;        __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.CompanyName,&#xA;        __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.Payments.Select(payment =&gt; payment.PaymentIdentifier),&#xA;        __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.LicenseIds&#xA;    },&#xA;    LastPaymentDate = __h__TransparentIdentifier0.lastPayment == null ? __h__TransparentIdentifier0.order.OrderedAt : __h__TransparentIdentifier0.lastPayment.At&#xA;})&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And this is actually much better. Still not good enough, mind. we can do better than that. It is a simple change:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;docs.Orders.Select(order =&gt; new {&#xA;    order = order,&#xA;    lastPayment = order.Payments.LastOrDefault()&#xA;}).Select(this0 =&gt; new {&#xA;    Query = new System.Object[] {&#xA;        this0.order.FirstName,&#xA;        this0.order.LastName,&#xA;        this0.order.OrderNumber,&#xA;        this0.order.Email,&#xA;        this0.order.Email.Split(new System.Char[] {&#xA;            &#x27;@&#x27;&#xA;        }),&#xA;        this0.order.CompanyName,&#xA;        this0.order.Payments.Select(payment =&gt; payment.PaymentIdentifier),&#xA;        this0.order.LicenseIds&#xA;    },&#xA;    LastPaymentDate = this0.lastPayment == null ? this0.order.OrderedAt : this0.lastPayment.At&#xA;})&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And now we got to something far more readable .</p>

We go to private beta before the product is done, because we want to get as much early feedback as we can. We have 10 spots for NHibernate Profiler v2.0 and 10 spots for Entity Framework Profiler v2.0. If you are interested, please send me an email about this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">You might have noticed that I am talking a lot about support and operations recently.&#xA0; This is because we have been doing a lot of work around that area. Making sure that RavenDB is even more forthcoming and open about what is going on. This week it has been about making sure that the shutdown phase of RavenDB is as transparent as it could be. Debugging those sort of issues is a PITA, because you very rarely really stop to consider them. But we got some feedback from customers about a common set of issues there. Under some circumstances, shutting down RavenDB might take a while. We identified several things that can cause this, mostly indexing in progress. The first thing we did is change the way we are doing indexing to allow aborting them during shutdown, but there are still a set of operations that might take a while that we have to complete even in shutdown scenario. For example, we might be just in the middle of flushing to disk, and we really want that to complete successfully (otherwise we would need to run an expensive check on startup). Therefor, we added this:  You&#x2019;ll still have to wait, sure. But now if you watch the logs you can see why, and have some understanding about how long this is going to take.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I wanted to improve the RavenDB query optimizer, so it can merge similar indexes into a single index. It is actually fairly simple to do (conceptually). But that leaves us with the problem of what to do with the indexes that we just superseded. The whole point here is to reduce the number of indexes, not to create an index that will never be used. So the next step was to make sure that we can cleanup unused auto indexes. That is great&#x2026; Except that we don&#x2019;t have any way of tracking unused indexes, so before we could do that, we have to add tracking for query times. Okay, let us do that. Wait, we don&#x2019;t have a place to put those in, and anyway, we don&#x2019;t want to save it all the time, that would mean IO for every query, and what about concurrent queries? So we need to add a way to save this, and make sure that there is some batching going on in there, so we won&#x2019;t go to the disk all the time. And wait, there is this other feature over there that needs something similar, so we might as well solve both problems at once&#x2026; Okay, let us add that. Now, where were we again? That annoying thing about this? You only realize that those are actually problems when you run some deep analysis on the actual feature request. And usually you have to have multiple cycles to get it all out. It is also very easy to go down one branch, all the way to the bottom, then go up to another branch, which was opened up because of the work you just did. Make for a good workday, but make it harder to predict what you are going to do today.</p>
