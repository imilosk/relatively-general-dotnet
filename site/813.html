            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the comments to this post, Hildo had this to say:            The problem with this is that the code written by excellent programmers like Eric will not always be understandable by coders in the lowr 50% of the bell curve. The code will be concise and well-designed, but as a result not like like the typical &#x201C;write it all out&#x201D; code that typical programmers churn out.                This matters because the code will have to maintained and enhanced by such programmers for the remainder of its life, which is likely to be far longer and far more costly than the development time.                I see this all the time at work ($VERYBIGCOMPANY). Programs that need to survive for a long time (5-10 years) are on purpose given to large groups of mediocre programmers, so the code will be at their level and can be maintained by them. Short-term high-priority projects are given to really great programmers, but if theu survive longer than expected, they often have to be rewritten from scratch 2-3 years down the road when requirements have changed fundamentally and the original developer is working on another important project.        This approach sucks. I do not doubt that it happens, but it has happened from the wrong reason. It sounds like the &quot;really great programmers&quot; are hackers, in the deregatory sense of the word. There is no way a good project would be replace in a 2-3 years just to get it to a more maintainable level for medicore programmers. By definition, this is not a good project.    I talked with a company that rejected just about everything I had to offer. The reasoning was that what we offered wasn&#x27;t something that the average (or slightly less than that) programmer would know, and they were afraid of their stuff would not be able to maintain that. In the end, it got to the point where we did the math. Using smarter tools and working with higher level of abstraction would allow to deliver a higher quality system within a shorter period of time. Considerring that they were bringing new programmers to the company every couple of months at most, the cost of training would be negligible.    I could make them see the numbers, I couldn&#x27;t get it through. &quot;It is not the way we work&quot;.     Well, you work stupid.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My preferred approach to develop on the web is using MonoRail, but since I am doing a lot of work for clients, they sometimes get to choose the technology. My current project is using Web Forms and Atlas.&#xA0; I already mentioned that I am using Igloo to provide a truer MVC support for WebForms, it is not as good as what MonoRail can provide, but it is nice. (The only problem is that I keep feeling that my controllers are getting too big and complex, I have finally finished doing a stint on the UI that left me little time for refactoring, but it is getting past time to do it).    I believe that I have already mentioned in the past that I am not particulary fond of Web Forms, it is a leaky abstraction, trying to bring a semblence of statefulness to something that is stateless by nature. I did some big projects with WebForms, and I was bitten really bad by some of the stuff that went under the hood.    At any rate, here is the stuff that we came up with for the project:            Disable viewstate. That means that I disable it&#xA0;at the web.config level, and never enable it. Like most ASP.Net developers, I have been fighting with ViewState for a long time. It means that controls &quot;forget&quot; their state, and that sometimes I need to maintain state on my own, but it means that I get a lot more control on what is going on in the application. For some annoying reason, I still get a _VIEWSTATE variable in the pages, I assume that it is the ControlState, but so far I haven&#x27;t dug far enough to find yet. I got some worrying responses from team mates, about what the implications of this can be. I had to sit and show them with Fiddler what is going on the wire to make sure that they understand what is happening.            Understand how Update Panels work. They are really cool technology. I am usually critical of Microsoft, but I have to say that I like UpdatePanels, they are a good solution for a problem that most WebForms developers need to deal with.            Do not get the data from the controls, get it from the request. There are two reasons for this, the first&#xA0;reason for it is simple, it is possible to access the request object from everywhere, it is much harder (and not wise) to pass the controls references. The second reason is that the controls will lie to you about their state. I just run into a situation where a DropDown reported SelectedValue = &quot;&quot; when the selected item was the one defined on the aspx (with append data bound items set to true), while on the request it was &quot;0&quot;, the value given in the aspx.            Do no processing the the code behind files. When my controllers do not get the data directly from the request object, they expose methods such as:        public&#xA0;ICollection&lt;Policy&gt;&#xA0;GetPoliciesForCustomer(string&#xA0;maybeId);                        Don&#x27;t bother with the designer.            Consider using the AjaxToolkit where appropriate, but be aware that it is not mature yet. If it gives you the least bit of trouble, drop it and go to Google.            Watin is really cool.            Would you write the tests already?    It is not comprehensive list by any mean, but this is just a few things that were brought up.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">From Steve Freeman:There&#x27;s an interesting exchange going on in the .Net world (actually, in the Israeli .Net TDD with Mocks world, which I imagine is about as small as a community gets).    I just love this sentence :-) And I really like this discussion. Eli has responded to me and Roy&#x27;s posts. Let us see if I can make an articulate response.    In my previous post, I showed a case where a testing seam was useful for enabling change down the road (you can see the code itself below). Eli was quick to point YAGNI. I can see his point of view. The difference is that I feel that if I need to change the design to make it more testable, I am adding value, not substracting it.    It is Test Driven Design, and the purpose is to have low coupled design, not just to test the code. TypeMock is a powerful framework, but I think that using it to enable brute force testing is harming the design process. You get regression tests via TDD, sure, but that isn&#x27;t the point. Otherwise the next big feature for xUnit would be integration to the bug tracking on test failures.    The point is that you end up with flexible, working code.&#xA0;Eli finishes he post with this question:            Quiz: Which is easier to maintain:                 File.WriteAllText(filename, text);                 or                 using(TextWriter&#xA0;writer&#xA0;=&#xA0;IoC.Resolve&lt;IFileWriterFactory&gt;().Create(filename))        &#xA0;&#xA0;writer.Write(text);         I am probably not the target audiance, I recently had to explain why I needed four levels of abstraction just to get user input. But for myself, the second snippet is easier to maintain. IFileWriteFactory has well defined roles with regards to transactability and&#xA0;relaiability. A class that contains the first snippet is doing more than it should, in my opinion. The moment that is starts doing too much, I lose the ability to track it. I look at the snippets above and consider them in the context of the entire application, and it makes sense. I wouldn&#x27;t use the IoC one for a toy app, but I can&#x27;t think of a situation where I would just use File.WriteAllText() except in the depth of the util library, where I can absolutely control it.    I think that the difference in opinion between Eli and me is rooted in whatever YAGNI is applicable to testing hooks. In my opinion it does not, since I cosider the decoupled design that is often the result of the TDD as a major benefit by itself, regardless of anything else. I am one of those that approach code with a finger already positioned over the delete key, but I care about extensability in a big way.I was working with a team member today and I selected a bunch of code to make a point, which elicited the immediate response:&quot;Don&#x27;t delete that!&quot;    I probably have very different ideas about what extensible software is than most people, I would admit, but I have found that this approach means that I can respond to change more easily this way. I have seen black box systems, but I have yet to see a well design black box system. Such is possible (I may create one, just fo kicks), but it is very rarely the case.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have a way too long commute, and I usually spend it by listening to podcasts.

I couldn&#x27;t find the download link, and I looked for two whole minutes before I finally saw this:        It was sitting right in front of me, but it looked like an ad, so I didn&#x27;t see it. Right now I have exactly two reactions to advertising. If it possible, ignore it. If it is not, avoid it. There is a reason I almost never watch TV or listen to the radio anymore. Too much annoying ads. Even going to the movies is getting pretty annoying, there is a limit to how much I can take.    I like listening to TWiT, and Leo used to go at length about how much he would appriciate if the listener would buy a Dell. I didn&#x27;t mind that at all, because it wasn&#x27;t an commercial, it was just sponsorship. On the other hand, I tried to listen to carnky geek podcast, and around minute eight, there was a commercial. For a minute I thought that I was listening to the radio, but then I just moved to another podcast, I don&#x27;t need the irritation (and that is on a device that I can just forward through the ads with).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Mahor reason: Latency.    On a local network, it takes more than 0.2 second (the human noticable delay) to checkout a file. This means that I can open a file, start editting it, and for a split second, not get a response from the editor. Annoying as hell.    Jeffrey Palermo posted about a refactoring he had made that touched 200 files. Using the Team System Model, that is nearly a minute when the IDE is basically unusable. I tend to do this kind of refactoring fairly often, and it feels like I am back using the VS Refacoring support.    Minor reasons: poor support fo disconnected scenarios, read-only files, the cmd line tools will throw up a GUI interface, no lightweight client support.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There are some interesting points of views about testable design that I somehow missed catching in real time.    Roy Osherove:...in many ways, pure object oriented design does not go well hand in hand with the notion of testable design.    He then goes on to show what happens when you addTestability concerns to the some of the usual OOD principals.    Eli Lupian:Roy and I are on the opposite sides of this methodology. I personally hate to change my production code just for the tests.As Roy says &#x201C;pure object oriented design does not go well hand in hand with the notion of testable design.&#x201D; After creating a good design (without taking testability into account), there is no real business value of implementing hooks to change internal private members and to expose properties that should remain private by design! Unless you want to clutter your code with load of Totally Irrelevant Code Please, Stop Designing for testability!!     He then shows how you can keep traditional OOP approach and still test your code using TypeMock.    I am firmly in Roy&#x27;s camp when it comes for designing code to be testable. Before I goes on to explain further, I want to take issue with a couple of points in Eli&#x27;s post:Have you ever tried to browse a code with loads of interfaces, it take ages because you have to keep finding the concrete implementation, and the place where the instance was created.    Ctrl&#x2B;Alt&#x2B;B in Resharper will take me directly to the implementation. grep *.cs -S &quot;interface\s&#x2B;INameOfInterface&quot; will do the same if I don&#x27;t have Resharper. Not an issue.Think about this&#xA0;code smell: When you find that an interface and implementation have exactly the&#xA0;same public methods, it is a sign that the interface is not exposing a trait of the object but the Object itself    No a code smell at all, in my opinion, just good seperation of the interface and its implementation. I may want to supply alternate implementation, which would be much harder if I had to a concrete class to work with.    Let me share a story. A&#xA0;while ago I was working on a system that needed to write to a file. The simplest code that I could write was:File.WriteAllText(filename,&#xA0;text);    That is not testable without using an invasive approach like TypeMock, so I choose this way:using(TextWriter&#xA0;writer&#xA0;=&#xA0;IoC.Resolve&lt;IFileWriterFactory&gt;().Create(filename))    &#xA0;&#xA0;writer.Write(text);    I added two level of abstractions to the code, just to make it testable. Following Eli&#x27;s approach, I had decreased the readability of the code and made it harder to understand and maintain. The problem is that I don&#x27;t think that Eli considered the value of the seams that are created by writing testable code. (Take a look at the stats here, it was a bit more involved).    A seam is a core concept in Working Effectively With Legacy Code. A seam is a place where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place. They are crucial for being able to test your code. (Just to note, TypeMock create seams all over the place by simply being able to intercept any call under .Net).    Seams makes the code testable, but it also makes it a lot more flexible. Couple of weeks after I introduced the IFileWriterFactory, I had&#xA0;learned that the files that I was creating were to be consumed by a stupid batch process, which would copy them over to a mainframe system. If I happened to be in the middle of creating the file when the process start running, the mainframe would get a partial file, and chaos would enuse.    The standard way of handling this is to actually output two files, one with the real content, the second with an agreed upon extension, which basically tells the process &quot;if you see a file with extension foo.csv.done, I have finished writing the file foo.csv&quot;. I had couple hundreds places in the application that I was writing files.    If I was following the traditional approach, I had to find all the places that I was writing to a file, and change the to:File.WriteAllText(filename,&#xA0;text);    File.WriteAllText(filename&#x2B;&quot;.done&quot;, &quot;&quot;);    As I mentioned, there were quite a few place that did it. Because I had a seam in place, I could simple change the returned implementation of the TextWriter that FileWriterFactory implemented, which would generate the &quot;.done&quot; file when the writer was disposed. You can bet that this was a valuable thing to be able to do.    In general, I find that testable design if far more flexible, because it means that you can inject different behaviors into the code. This means that you get more extensible code that you can later leverage to produce more business value. The simple abstraction that I have shown above is something that saved me two days of mindlessly going through the code and making the same stupid change all over the place.Theoretically, I could probably use some black magic and intercepted the call to FileSteam.Close() and do the same. I do not feel that it would be a maintainable or discoverable solution at all.    So no, I do not believe that testability is not a first class concern, and I feel that it produce much better code in the end. Having more places where you can change the behavior without changing the code is a good thing, and it would end up saving you quite a bit of time. I can see it in Rhino Mocks all over the place, the fact that it is as decoupled as that means that I can take it in different directions (and offer extensability points for users) very easily.     The other side is apperant in many recent Microsoft releases, where internal and sealed are slapped on just about anything, and extensability points for something that they didn&#x27;t explicitly planned are simply non-existant. This in turn greatly reduce the ability to work with the code.</p>
