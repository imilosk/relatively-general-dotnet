            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, so I need to check if a username/password are valid on a given Active Directory domain (which is not the one that I am runing on). Here is the options that I came up with:            public bool IsValidLogin(string username, string password)                                {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; IntPtr userId = IntPtr.Zero;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; if (LogonUser(username, domain, password, LOGON32_LOGON_INTERACTIVE,                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; LOGON32_PROVIDER_DEFAULT,                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; ref userId))                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; CloseHandle(userId);                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; return true;                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; }                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; return false;                                }                I am not sure that the above code works for remote domains, and I am not sure that it works in all cases. LOGIN32_LOGIN_INTERACTIVE seems to be something that you shouldn&#x27;t do on servers, but it doesn&#x27;t work unles I run it with it.    Here is what MSDN seems to recommend:            public bool IsAuthenticated(string domain, string username, string pwd)                                {                                &#xA0; string domainAndUsername = domain &#x2B; @&quot;\&quot; &#x2B; username;                                &#xA0; DirectoryEntry entry = new DirectoryEntry( _path,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; domainAndUsername,                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; pwd);                                                                &#xA0; try                        &#xA0; {                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; // Bind to the native AdsObject to force authentication.                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Object obj = entry.NativeObject;                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; DirectorySearcher search = new DirectorySearcher(entry);                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; search.Filter = &quot;(SAMAccountName=&quot; &#x2B; username &#x2B; &quot;)&quot;;                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; search.PropertiesToLoad.Add(&quot;cn&quot;);                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; SearchResult result = search.FindOne();                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; if(null == result)                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; return false;                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; }                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; // Update the new path to the user in the directory                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; _path = result.Path;                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; _filterAttribute = (String)result.Properties[&quot;cn&quot;][0];                                &#xA0; }                                &#xA0; catch (Exception ex)                                &#xA0; {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; throw new Exception(&quot;Error authenticating user. &quot; &#x2B; ex.Message);                                &#xA0; }                                &#xA0; return true;                                }        I have numerous style, guidelines, performance, and best practices issues with this code.     Any other ways you can recommend?    I should note that this is actually the first time that I am interfacing with AD, although my company is doing a lot of work in this area, I always was the database/business functionality guy so far.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This&#xA0;caught my eye, and I wanted to comment. This post is talking about my recent move and my use of BlogML, and it included this statement:like always there is no problem with BlogML and the main stage is the easiest one!    I am a developer, if BlogML wasn&#x27;t around, I would have read the XML and issues SQL commands, it is not much harder, after all. Considerring that I had to literally tweak the BlogML exporter for DasBlog to make it work, it may have been easier that route.    The main stage was actually not the transfer of data from one blog to the next. It was actually making the second blog accept it correctly. Such things as cleaning up some posts so SubText can accept them, or ensuring that it is in the correct order, etc. I accept that there isn&#x27;t much that can be done by BlogML here to make it work better.    However, one thing that I spend quite a bit of time on is the mapping of old URLs to new ones. That is a big issue for me, and anyone that change their blogging engine but keeping their blog in the same place (hm, that may be only me, actually...).</p>

It worked, but it wasn&#x27;t good. You maybe put a little TODO there, but deep in your hearth, you know that you are going to forget it. Let me introduce you to a new paradigm:    Hack bombing - the practice of where you leave a hack, you time bomb it so you would have to come back and fix it later.            try                {        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;//do&#xA0;stuff                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;return&#xA0;true;        }        catch&#xA0;//&#xA0;no&#xA0;idea&#xA0;how&#xA0;to&#xA0;prevent&#xA0;an&#xA0;exception&#xA0;here&#xA0;at&#xA0;the&#xA0;moment,&#xA0;this&#xA0;make&#xA0;it&#xA0;work&#xA0;for&#xA0;now...                {        &#xA0;&#xA0;if&#xA0;(DateTime.Today&#xA0;&gt;&#xA0;new&#xA0;DateTime(2007,&#xA0;2,&#xA0;7))        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;throw&#xA0;new&#xA0;InvalidOperationException(&quot;fix&#xA0;me&#xA0;already!!&#xA0;no&#xA0;catching&#xA0;exceptions&#xA0;like&#xA0;this!&quot;);        &#xA0;&#xA0;return&#xA0;false;        }                I wrote the above today. So it will work, for now... But in three days times KABOOM. My shameful secret will be revealed to the world, so I have to fix it before this happen.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got a comment from Jonathan Wanagel&#xA0;on my CodePlex WTF. I complained that I couldn&#x27;t get an access to source via Team System. I do not consider tarballs to be a good way of getting source for projects that I may be interested at. There is too much stuff that I cannot do that I should be able to (diff, reverts, easy update to new revision, patches, etc).    Here is the comment:Unfortunately TFS isn&#x27;t scalable enough to support all the anonymous users on CodePlex, so we restrict SCC access to project team members only.&#xA0;We&#x27;re investigating ways to get around this.    I am not quite sure what I am supposed to think about this. The cheeky answer is: Well, Subversion can.     Note: It is probably a lot easier to scale a Subversion farm than a TFS farm, because of the wildly different architecture choices made. TFS depends on SQL Server, which is complex to setup for thousands of concurrent users, Subversion is much simpler in this regard.    Let me run by that again, CodePlex is supposed to be an Open Source hosting site, but it doesn&#x27;t let me access the source&#xA0;in an acceptable way, it&#xA0;doesn&#x27;t let me create patches easily, it doesn&#x27;t work.    I have an OSS project on the side that I don&#x27;t even try to gather community around (Rhino Tools), so far I have gotten several dozens patches (99% of them accepted), because the source was there, it was easy to access, it was easy to modify and then send the patch to me to merge it in. I seriously fail to see the value that CodePlex can provide an Open Source project.    You may think that this is a minor matter, but I consider this a make-or-break point.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got several comments about my Can you learn to program better?&#xA0;post, mostly asking what I thought were the things that helps programmers makes the leap from average joe programer to the uber developer. Harry had posted in the comments a great explanation:... from observing people I consider &#x27;Greate&#x27; and &#x27;OK&#x27; programmers, I have my theory about why most programmers didn&#x27;t make the jump.        The most important fact is that for every improvement they are usually a &#x27;pattern&#x27; or &#x27;paradigm&#x27; shift, rather than single improvement. What I mean is, there are almost many skills and behaviors you have to learn first before you can be comfortable in the new level.        For instance, everyone knows TDD is good, but not everyone practices it. Some of us trying to do it in our code and found it difficult and don&#x27;t know whether those tests are useful or not. Only later when we learned more about DDD to make our object model solid, MVP/MVC to make our presentation level untangled, NHibernate to coquer the ORM chasm, we realized that everything kind of make sense to us. But before that, most programmers are just stop trying, claiming there is no difference between good and bad, or just move to management. ;=)        If my theory is true, here are some ways to get to the great level:        1. You can keep trying, and finally get there.    2. You can speed up your learning by invest a lot of money on books, trainings, ... etc to help you get there. (Training, Conference)    3. You can join a strong team, so you can focus on only learning small amound and feeling safe that your team will help on others. &#xA0;(Pair Programming)        In any ways, it&#x27;s hard if you don&#x27;t have help (company support, team support, ...). It will even slow your productivity.    I would have to say that I agree in full. There isn&#x27;t a single thing that you can do to significantly improve your abilities. My current tag line is &quot;Specialization is For Insects&quot;, and I believe that this is the case. Yes, development has grown huge and we are told that we must specialize. But before we can specialize we need to understand a lot of the general stuff.    A lot of this come from doing stuff. Not just routine stuff at work. I have a lot more respect for someone that dedicate from their time to build stuff for themselves. I am a great believer in OSS resume, as I have stated before.     Don&#x27;t stay in the same field, if you are a winforms programmer, go grab ASP.Net book and build a project. If you are a winforms guy, drop to the database and write some store procedure and tweak some indexes. Build your own Ajax framework and write a custom control for WPF. Spend some time making a database server dance to your tune, then turn your head toward a profiler.     Write at least one hard-core, low level utility that you can use on a frequent basis. Get a book about networking and build a network tracer, learn python and use it for a month for all those daily tasks. Get Ruby on Rails book and implement the excersizes, spend some time digging through the academic literature.&#xA0;Write a chapter for a fictional book about a subject that interest you. Go give a lecture in a user group.&#xA0;Write some COM interop code, and then implement A*Star.    Spend a day in notepad and compiling from the command line, build your own DSL toolkit. Create a program that dynamically compiles and run itself, prevent it from killing your computer. Dedicate an hour a day for a month to answer questions in a tech forum / newsgroup. Open a blog and post about your cat.&#xA0;Take a look at the sky and try to reduce the abstraction.    You are not expected to do any of the above, as a matter of fact. If I will ever meet someone who did it all, I would make sure to keep them far away from any caffeinated beverages.&#xA0;The easiest thing in the world is to remain in the part that you already know. You need to learn new stuff, and you need to do it all the time. Find a subject that you don&#x27;t know and learn a bit about it. Improve your learning skills to the point where you see new stuff as adventure, not a treat.    At any rate, what I am trying to say is that you need to act. Doesn&#x27;t matter what you do, you need to keep pushing your knowledge until extra knowledge is easy to absorb. Learn to be articulate, that one is important.    I can tell you right now that I know of a lot of subjects that I really would like to know more, which range from compiler theory to 3d math, to knowing right from left. I think that the most important thing that I have is the belief that I am able to do it when I need to. Do not be afraid if you don&#x27;t get it in the first few times, often enough you need extra knowledge that will come by, and when you will return to it, it will be much clearer.    I am beginning to sound like a self help book, I am afraid, so I will stop. Go get the Pragmatic Programmer book, though, that will help.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Hm, how about this for nose butting? I am going to talk about Java, the language I write an applet with, and iBatis, the ORM I never used. At any rate, this post&#xA0;was forwarded to me, and I found it interesting enough that I think that it deserve a comment.    First, let me run through some things that I do not believe to be correct, and then I will touch the subject in a more general fashion.With Hibernate, each time you run a new HQL query, Hibernate will reload all objects in the session cache into memory.    That is not the case. Or at least, that sentence is not worded correctly. All the objects that are loaded from the query will be put in the session cache, but there is not reloading done. The session cache is always in memory. This sentence and several others down the road seems to indicate a problem with Hibernate&#x27;s usage, getting SELECT N&#x2B;1 or maybe Overly Eager Fetch.In an RCP application, however, this behavior can kill you. If the entire object graph that a single client knows about is a half a gigabyte, then as the user interacts with the application, eventually that entire object graph will wind up in the session cache. The result is that every time your application runs an HQL query, before Hibernate can even translate the query into SQL and optimize it, it must reload 512 megabytes of objects into its session cache.    That is not even remotedly close to the way Hibernate works, I must maintain. I do not understand the meaning of reload objects into its session cache, though, reload from where? From the database?&#xA0;Without further information, I can only assume that the mapping for Hibernate were setup incorrectly, and that caused a lot of unneccesary reads.     What does happen before a query is run is that the items are checked for changes, and if there are changes, and if Hibernate detects that they can affect the result of the query, it will persist those changes (assuming you are in AutoFlush mode).Moving from a mixture of HQL and SQL to all queries being in SQL has dramatically simplified query writing, debugging, and optimization.    There is a time and place for using SQL in Hibernate, but those are usually very rare edge cases. If you are constantly using SQL in Hibernate, you are doing something wrong. David also mentions that they were building queries using string concatation, which is consider as a big DO NOT DO, that is what the criteria API is for.    Now, for the real issue:    Working with Hibernate or NHibernate in a desktop envrionment can be a little more challanging than on the web. The issue is that you need to make sure that your session doesn&#x27;t live for the duration of the application. The reason is, of course, the session cache. Using a single session for the application would basically be a memory leak, since the objects would never be released.    Common ways to solve this problem is to use Session per Conversation (think about a wizard or a dialog), to reduce the amount of time that you are keeping items in memory. This is usually something that you need to pay attention to when you load large object graphs, and then you can use the Evict() method to remove it from the session cache.    Personally, I find that it is easier to simply manage the session and not the entities. I would also usually combine this with a file based second level cache, NHibernate has the Prevelance cache that can be used, and I am sure that Hibernate has similar cache implementations.     The book Java Persistence with Hibernate have some information about it, including a sample application that I really ought to port to .Net one day.     I had the pleasure of building several desktop applications that used NHibernate, and I really liked the options that it gave me there (no need to worry about loading too much objects, second level cache that is persistant, etc). In short, you can safely use Hibernate or NHibernate in a desktop application, there are several things that you should be aware of, like the session lifetime, and that you need to close the session at the end of a conversation, but those are simply things to implement, and the benefits are really great.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">On my Castle.Igloo post, Jonathan Allen&#xA0;asks in a comment:                    I&#xA0;don&#x27;t understand why you think you have a problem. Consider these passaged from the original definition of the MVC pattern:                &quot;Communication between a view and its associated controller is straightforward because View and Controller are specifically designed to work together. Models, on the other hand, communicate in a more subtle manner.&quot;                &quot;Unlike the model, which may be loosely connected to multiple MVC triads, Each view is associated with a unique controller and vice versa. Instance variables in each maintain this tight coupling.&quot;                -- Applications Programming in Smalltalk-80(TM): How to use Model-View-Controller (MVC)                 http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/smarch/st-docs/mvc.html                        Notice how it explicitly says that there will be a tight coupling between the view and controller.                While your view of MVC is shared by many, I have a hard time reconciling it with the original definition. They are not just variants; they are on literally opposite positions in regards to coupling.                I would like to hear your position on exactly what the MVC pattern is. And if it does in fact differ from the original definition, the reasons why you think the &#x27;new&#x27; definition is better.        I think that it boils down to the fact that I have at least some MonoRail experiance, and I tend to think about stuff a little differently about those things now. I mainly focus on seperating the controller from its views, this is done because in WebForms, the other way is not really possible (at least not with a lot more magic, at which point you are with MR but with WebFroms, in which case it is better to use MR in the first place). Seperating the controller from the view helps when you want to unit test it, for instance, or reuse it in a different context.    &#xA0;As for a concrete example for why I would want this speration, here is a simple example:    I have PostsController, which should display a list of posts for the user. This means that I have ViewPosts.aspx page, and because I am using Atlas, there is also a web service over JSON that is used by the page to page between the pages dynamically. Doing this in the traditional way would force me to create two controllers, PagePostsController and WebServicePostsController. But I don&#x27;t see much point in splitting the responsability. Using Igloo, I can reuse the PostsController in both views, since there is no dependency on a view.    Evne if I assume that I had used an interface to seperate things, I would still get issues, because the Page and the WebService has distinctly different charactaristics.&#xA0;In tests, I could test the controller fully, without needing to mock the view, which makes my job much easier.    The reverse option may be a page that needs to list several things, so it may want to use several controllers (PostsController, CommentsController). I am not sure if this is a good idea yet, but that is possible with Igloo, and I think that it make sense, at least on the surface.</p>
