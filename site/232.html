            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Sometimes you see the impossible. In one of our scenarios, we saw a cluster that had such a bad case of split brain that it came near to fracturing the very boundaries of space &amp; time. In a three node cluster, we have one node that looked to be fine. It connected to all the other nodes and was the cluster leader. The other two nodes, however, were not in the cluster and in fact, they were showing signs that they never were in the cluster.What was really strange was that we took the other two machines down and the first node was still showing a successful cluster. We looked deeper and realized that it wasn&#x2019;t actually a healthy situation, in fact, this node was very rapidly switching between leader and follower mode. It took a bit of time to figure out what was going on, but the root cause was DNS. We had the three nodes on separate DNS (a.oren.development.run, b.oren.development.run, c.oren.development.run) and they were setup to point to the three machines. However, we have previously used the same domain names to run a cluster on the first machine only. Because of the way DNS updates, whenever the machine at a.oren.development.run would try to connect to b.oren.development.run it would actually connect to itself. At this point, A would tell B that it is the leader. But A is B, so A would respond by becoming a follower (because it was told it should, by itself). Because it became a follower, it disconnected from itself. After a timeout, it would become leader again, and the cycle would continue. Every time that the server would get up, it would whip itself down again. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a leader&#x201D;, &#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m a leader&#x201D;, etc.This is a fun thing to discover. We had to trace pretty deep to figure out that the problem was in the DNS cache (since the DNS itself was properly updated).We fixed things so we now recognize if we are talking to ourselves and error properly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This blog post was a very interesting read. It talks about the ipify service and how it grew. It is an interesting post, but what really caught my eye was the performance details. In particular, this talks about exceeding 30 billions of requests per month. The initial implementation used Node, and couldn&#x2019;t get more than 30 req/second or so and the current version seems to be in Go and can handle about 2,000 requests a second.I&#x2019;m interested in performance so I decided to see why my results would be. I very quickly wrote the simplest possible implementation using Kestrel and threw that on a t2.nano in AWS. I&#x2019;m pretty sure that this is the equivalent for the dyno that he is using. I then spun another t2.small instance and used that to bench the performance of the system. All I did was just run the code with release mode on the t2.nano, and here are the results:&quot;So we get 25,000 requests a second and some pretty awesome latencies under very high load on a 1 CPU / 512 MB machine. For that matter, here are the top results from midway through on the t2.nano machine:I should say that the code I wrote was quick and dirty in terms of performance. It allocates several objects per request and likely can be improved several times over, but even so, these are nice numbers. Primarily because there is actually so little that needs to be done here. To be fair, a t2.nano machine is meant for burst traffic and is not likely to be able to sustain such load over time, but even when throttled by an order of magnitude, it will still be faster than the Go implementation .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rowhammer is a type of attack on the way DRAM is built. A specific write pattern to a specific memory cell can cause &#x201C;leakage&#x201D; to nearby memory cells, causing bit flips. The issue we were facing in production ended up being very similar. The initial concern was that a database on disk size was very large. Enough that we started a serious investigating into what exactly is taking all this space. Our internal reporting said, nothing. And that was very strange. Looking at the actual file usage, we had a lot of transaction journals taking a lot of space there. By a lot I mean that the size of the data file in question was 32 MB and the journals were taking a total of over 15GB. To be fair, some of them were kept around to be reused, but that was bad.It took a while to figure out what was going on. This particular Voron instance was used for a map/reduce index on a database that had high write throughput. Because if that, the indexing was always active. So far, so good, we have several other such instances, and they don&#x2019;t exhibit this behavior. What was different about this index is that due to the shape of the index and the nature of the data, what ended up happening is that we&#x2019;ll always modify the same (small) set of the data. This index sums up a number of events and aggregate them based on when they happened. This particular system handle about a hundred updates a second on average, and can peak to about five to seven times that. The index gives us things such as &#x201C;how many events of each type happened today&#x201D; and things like that. This means that there is a lot of locality in the updates. And that was the key. Even though this index (and the Voron storage that backed it) was experienced a lot of writes, these writes almost always happened to the same set of data (basically updating the counters). That means that there wasn&#x2019;t actually just a very small set of pages in the data that were modified. And that set off a chain of behaviors that results in a lot of disk space being used. A lot of data is modified, meaning that we need to write a lot to the journal on each transaction.Because the same data is constant modified, the total amount of modified bytes is smaller than a certain threshold.Writes are constants.Flushing the data to disk is expensive, so we try to avoid it.We can only delete journals after we flushed the data.Because we try to avoid flushing to disk if we can, we only do that when there is enough idle time or when enough data has been modified. In this case, there was no idle time, and the amount of data that was modified was too small to hit the limit.The system would actually balance itself out eventually (which is why it stopped at around ~15GB or so of journals). At some point we would either hit an idle spot or the buffer will hit the limit and we&#x2019;ll flush to disk, which allow us to free the journals, but that happened only after we had quite a few. The fix was to add a limit to how long we&#x2019;ll delay flushing to disk in such a case and was quite trivial once we figure out what exactly all the different parts were doing.</p>
