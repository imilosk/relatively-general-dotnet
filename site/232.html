            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The whole point of having a prison is ensuring that the inmates are staying in. As such, the process of actually getting an inmate out of the prison is quite involved. I&#x2019;m using the release workflow as an obvious example, but there are many such workflows inside the prison that are similar. The inmate&#x2019;s intake workflow, or disciplinary workflows or even just inmate&#x2019;s transfers which can be quite complex (and typically also happen in big batches).In the previous post in this series, I talked briefly about the idea of workflows as an event publication with multiple signatories to the workflow operation. If this make no sense, let me try to explain. The trigger for starting an inmate&#x2019;s release can be the acceptance of a warrant for immediate release, the expiration of the warrant to hold the inmate. There are several other variants (transfer to another facility, death of inmate, escape of inmate, etc) that are related but are not too relevant for the discussion, so I&#x2019;ll just talk about the immediate release and the warrant expiration.For warrant expiration, the workflow starts from the Registration Office publishing the list of inmates that are supposed to be released today. In technical terms, they create a series of workflow documents that are in the Open state and this gets disseminated to the rest of the system. Immediate release warrant is usually served to the Registration Office, but may also be served directly to the block&#x2019;s sergeant. If the Registration Office got the immediate release warrant, things are identical as the usual scheduled release (except that this might be served at any time). However, if this is served to the block&#x2019;s sergeant, things are more interesting. At this point, it is the block that will initiate the workflow, but the overall responsibility for verifying the warrant and ensuring the actual release is still on the Registration Office. As an aside, the notion of &quot;who owns this&#x201D; is quite important in the prison. Mostly because if you mess up, there might be consequences. This can be holding an inmate past the due date (bad, can result in damages paid to the inmate and career consequences to the person who messed up) to releasing an inmate that wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be released (really bad, sometimes it is not possible / feasible to hold them again, requires court approval, may end up in jail time for the person who messed up and also result in possible dangerous inmate being released). So the idea is that at any time, there is an owner for this process and a clear finger pointing at that person, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re to blame&#x201D;. Because of this, there are typically multiple steps in the release process. Consider the simple scenario of a scheduled release, we have:Registering the inmate on the &#x201C;to be released&#x201D; list.Notifying external and internal parties about this inmate&#x2019;s pending release. For example, an inmate might have to go through a parole officer before actual release. This is done by sending the &#x201C;to be released&#x201D; list several days in advanced and getting at least an implicit agreement (by not vetoing / modifying the process) by external parties.Verification that there are no explicit holds on the inmate. In the case of an inmate that is supposed to be deported, the inmate&#x2019;s file will have an explicit &#x201C;deport on release&#x201D; which typically require coordinating with the border police to handle that. So the inmate can&#x2019;t just be shoved out the door but handed off to someone. Identification of the inmate at the block level. This is typically done on the sergeant&#x2019;s level and then by an officer (preferably from the same block) that are familiar with the inmate and can validate that this is indeed the one to be released.Checking out the inmate from the block level to the prison&#x2019;s level. This explicitly remove the inmate from the block&#x2019;s responsibility once the inmate has been handled off to the release queue.Identification of the inmate by the Registration Office&#x2019;s officer. This is a second verification that is done to ensure that there hasn&#x2019;t been a mix up again.Verification of the warrant to release the inmate and that there are no newer warrants that are in effect.Returning of personal affects and getting the inmate&#x2019;s signature that everything was properly returned.Checking the inmate out of the prison, this step explicitly ends the period in which the now ex-inmate is held in prison.Actually getting the newly released ex-inmate out of the prison. This can be to a family member at the gate or to a bus to the nearest city, etc.I&#x2019;m probably forgetting a few details in the middle, and there are branches for each and every one of these steps. In terms of the technical details of how this works. The workflow document is being distributed throughout the system, and then various parties are now in charge of actually completing the various tasks in the workflow. For example, this may mean checking out the inmate&#x2019;s personal affects from the safe in the morning, preparing for the release. So the steps aren&#x2019;t necessarily in sequence or ordered. The important thing is that the workflow document is published, and is now tracked. Typically, the release process is tracked by the Registration Office and the Command &amp; Control Center. The Command &amp; Control Center will typically be involved early in the process if an inmate isn&#x2019;t released by the typical time, and the close of day process for the Registration Office includes verification that there aren&#x2019;t any still pending inmate releases. At any given point, we can track the process of the workflow from any point in the system (remember, changes are made locally and then distributed to the rest of the system). In there is a communication issue between different parts of the prison, that will typically show up as an alert that a particular workflow hasn&#x2019;t been properly completed in the allotted time. At this point, external channel (walking &amp; talking, usually) is used to verify the status of this particular inmate release.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The design of Macto (that is this prison management application I&#x2019;m discussing) so far seems pretty strange. Some of the constraints are common, the desire for resiliency and being able to have each independent portion of the system work in isolation. However, the way we go about handling this is strange.I looked up the definition of a micro services architecture and I got to Martin Fowler, saying:..the microservice architectural style [1] is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.This wouldn&#x2019;t work for our prison system, because we are required to continue normal operations when we can&#x2019;t communicate with the other parts of the system. A prison block may not be able to talk to the Registration Office, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that it can error. Operations must continue normally.So RPC over HTTPS is out, but what about messaging? We can use a queue to dispatch commands / events to the other parties in the system, no? The answer is that we can do that, but let&#x2019;s consider how that will work. For events, that would work quite nicely, and have roughly the same model that we have now. In fact, with the RavenDB ETL process and the dissemination protocol in place, that is pretty much what we have. Changes to my local state are pushed via ETL to a shared known location and then distributed to the rest of the system.But what about commands? A command in the system can be things like &#x201C;we got a warrant for releasing an inmate&#x201D;. That is something that must proceed successfully. If there is a communication breakdown, generating an error message is not acceptable, in this case, someone will hand deliver the warrant to the block and get this inmate out of the prison. In other words, we have the notion of commands flowing in the system, but the same command can also come from the Registration Office or from a phone call or from a lawyer physically showing up at the block and shoving a bunch of papers at the sergeant on duty demanding an immediate release. All of this leads me to create an data architecture that is based on local data interaction with a backbone to share it, while relying on external channels to route around issues between parts of the system. Let&#x2019;s consider the case of a releasing an inmate. The normal way it works is that the Registration Office prepare a list of inmates that needs to be released today. Here is one such document, which is created on the Registration Office server.This then flow via ETL to the rest of the prison. Each block will get the list of inmates that they need to process for release and the Command &amp; Control Center is in charge that they are processed and released properly. I&#x2019;ll have a separate post to talk about such workflows, because they are interesting, but the key here is that we don&#x2019;t actually have a command being sent.Instead, we create a document starting the workflow for release. This is exactly the same as an event being published and it will be received by the other parties in the prison. At this point, each party is going to do their own thing. For example, the Command &amp; Control Center will verify that the bus to the nearest town is ordered and each block&#x2019;s sergeant is in charge of getting the inmates processed out of the block and into the hand of the Registration Office, which will handle things such as returning personal effects, second verification that the right inmate is released, etc.Unlike a command, which typically have a success / error code, we use this notion as well as timed alerts to verify that things happen. In other words, the Command &amp; Control Center will be alerted if the inmate isn&#x2019;t out of the prison by 10:00 AM and will take steps to check why that has happened. The Registration Office will also do its own checks at the close of the day, to ensure that no inmates are still in the prison when they shouldn&#x2019;t. Note that this involves multiple parties cooperating with each other, but none of them explicitly rely on request / response style of communication. This is message passing, and also event publication, but I find that this is a much more passive manner in which you&#x2019;ll work. Instead of explicitly interacting with the outside world, you are always operating on your own data, and additional work and tasks to do shows up as it is replicated from the other parts of the system.Another benefit of this approach is that it also ensures that there are multiple and independent verification steps for most processes, which is a good way to avoid making mistakes with people&#x2019;s freedom.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I talked about the flow of data in the system and introduced the notion of sharing data via explicit ETL processes. The ETL process is an explicit contract of each part of the system that shares some of the data to the outside world. By the way, in the context of the prison system, the outside world is a bit misleading, it might be more accurate to say that we share the data with the other parties inside the prison. Nothing here is actually available outside the prison itself (integration with other systems, such as the Department of Justice, other prisons, etc is an even more complex topic that I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;ll be covering. For now, assume that the method of integration if a Fax machine). Here is the simplest topology that we can build using this approach. The Registration Office has an ETL process that outputs the data it wants to share with a dedicated database, specially for this purpose. From this public database, we setup replication to dedicated database instances on each of the blocks. In other words, when the application inside the block wants to access some shared data, it isn&#x2019;t going to reach over the network and hit the public registration database but use a local instance that the public registration database is replicating to. Why do we have this behavior? Because we don&#x2019;t trust the network and must always rely on our own local resources. When the network is available, we&#x2019;ll get continuous updates via replication, and when it isn&#x2019;t available, we&#x2019;ll have the latest information that we possibly could and can still act on that (I&#x2019;ll have a separate post talking about workflow processes that mitigate eventual consistency and concurrency handling in such a system).This means that the application can always continue running, regardless of the state of the outside world.Another option, which is somewhat simpler, is to not have a public registration database, but a database that is there to share the data explicitly between all the different parties, this will look like this:In this case, each party&#x2019;s setup includes both the internal data that is required to running the block / office / department in question and a shared database that is used to hold all the data that is shared by all the parties in the prison.Note that the topology of the shared data is a full mesh. In other words, data that is sent to the shared database from the Registration Office using RavenDB ETL will be sent to all the other parties, this is the same as we had before. However, because we now have a shared database, if the Registration Office cannot talk to Block B, that block will still get all the updates from Block A, including the updates that originated from the Registration Office. This is because RavenDB replication uses the gossip model and can bridge such gaps in network without issue.This might be a simpler model, because the process of each party publishing information for the consumption of the rest of the prison is simplified, we simply define an ETL process to the shared database and the data will be distributed far and wide, made available to anyone that wants it.This has the advantage that most of the details of managing services can be deferred to RavenDB. You need to make sure that your ETL processes are contractual, that is, they don&#x2019;t change the shape or meaning of the data, and that is about it. All data access from the application is made to the local database and there is little need to worry about integration between the various parties, error handling of remote calls, etc.</p>
