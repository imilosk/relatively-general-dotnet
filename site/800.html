            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My post about entities and services seem to have hit a nerve, because it is probably my most popular post ever. I got some really good feedback on it. This post is mostly to ask questions, not neccesarily give answers. To make the discussion a bit more focused, here are the scenarios that I am talking about, in the context of a web-based application:            Display a list of customer&#x27;s orders.            Calculate total order cost            Display all the items in an order            Create new order            Add new item to order            Print full reciept for the order    Quite a few people didn&#x27;t like the fact that the service is tightly coupled to the implementation of Order.CalculateCost().&#xA0;Stephen suggested that I would use this type of code:money = orderService.GetOrder(orderId).CalculateCost()    If that is the case, there isn&#x27;t any difference between the service and a repository. The problem that I am trying to solve is actually performance, I want to load all the OrderLines assoicated with the order so I could make calculations over them. The code above would either cause lazy load, which is inefficent, or would always load everything, which is also inefficent.    Udi&#xA0;suggested building a set of interfaces for the actions that the class can take, and assoicate fetching strategies with each action, this way we decouple the service from the details of the CalculateCost() implementation. I like the idea, but I am not sure if this isn&#x27;t too much overhead for the scenario. Decoupling the fetching strategy is good, but I think that it is more appropriate for more complex problems.    Paul&#xA0;suggest going even further with the DDD route. I am pretty sure that I don&#x27;t understand what he means, so I would like it if someone could educate me. He had this code sample:            public&#xA0;T&#xA0;FindOne(IFetchSpecification&#xA0;fSpec)        {        &#xA0;fSpec.AddSpan(&quot;OrderLines&quot;);        &#xA0;return&#xA0;(T)context.Find(fSpec);        }        Which I don&#x27;t think is appropriate, once again, I don&#x27;t always want the order lines, I want them for specific scenarios only. And I am not sure how I can get the above code to behave in both scenarios.    (Currently) the last comment on the previous post belongs to Stephen, he suggests having an abstract type Order, and two decendants: DoesntHaveOrderLines&#xA0;and CalculatedOrder (which does have them). This solve the problem of knowing when to bring the data, but I really don&#x27;t think that splitting the entities according to performance concerns is a good way to go.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeremy Millier really hit the nail on the head with this one:I really think the .Net community needs to reexamine and debate the merits and appropriateness of the Visual RAD approach.&#xA0; A lot of what makes&#xA0;ASP.Net WebForms&#xA0;hard to test is the extra complexity that&#x27;s there to support design time controls, specifically the&#xA0;page&#xA0;event cycle.&#xA0; RAD is doing more damage than good because the negative impact on maintainability/testability overwhelms the &quot;write once&quot; advantages of RAD.</p>

You can check it here, took me a few seconds to figure it out, but Wow, this is a nice way of working with the code.    The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that there isn&#x27;t enough of generic type inferencing.    Update: more good stuff from the same guy here.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A book about ANTLR&#xA0;is something that I have long lusted after. It is something that I keep planning to learn, but the learning curve is too high to do this informally. Looks like I am getting my wish, The Definitive ANTLR Reference&#xA0;is in beta book now.    ANTLR is a compiler compiler, which makes it a great tool to write languages (Boo&#x27;s parser is written in ANTLR, for instance). And although I would generally use Boo for DSL, it is important to me to understand the parser as well.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Following my recent post about how to keep up with technology, I was asked how do I find the model of an application. By the model of an application I mean that core principals that guided the developers when they built it. For NHibernate, it is Unit of Work and Identity Map, when you know the two of those, the rest is mostly implementation details.    I don&#x27;t have a single answer for this. If you can get a hold of the developers, it is best, but it isn&#x27;t an approach that scales. A good way would be to look at unit tests, and see what the expected behavior is. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest a book in general, because a book will usually focus on the How to do stuff, not How is is done.    Take WPF for instnace, most books focus on the XAML and what you need to do in order to work with that, but XAML actually have very little with the WPF model. Dependecies properties and event bubbling are far more important concepts to understand.     Non-demo blog posts are good as well, but perhaps the best resource is to remove all the fluff from the technology and code without any abstractions between you and the technology. Go over the samples to get a feeling about what you should do, and then walk the stack and remove everything that hides something. Port existing code to the new technology, existing is important, because it would force you to map the concepts that you are not familiar with to the new technology concepts.    Reading the best practices sheet and the Dont Ever Do That column are also recommended, but don&#x27;t just memorize them, understand why they exists, this will usually tell you a lot about how it works from the inside.</p>

On the other hand, the label &#x201C;Microsoft&#x201D; on some random technology almost guarantees it is somewhat decent.    And that makes a lot of sense.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">But they still want cutting edge results...&#xA;    Adi had posted about my recent series of posts about getting the best tools for the job.&#xA;Since I don&#x27;t have the details I can only guess, but supposing Oren offered to use tools such as MonoRail, Castle and NHibernate (I&#x27;m just throwing buzzwords around) and the people from that company preferred custom code, does that make them stupid?&#xA;    Guilty as charged about the suggested. I argued that that we can get better productivity and higher quality, at the cost of having to train developers that we pick off the street. Adi think that I am overlooking the cost here:&#xA;I&#x27;m not so sure about that. Oren may be able to learn new technologies quickly when he needs them, but no every developer is the same, so training may become a huge drain on the project.&#xA;    I would like to refer to this post&#xA0;for backup. There is a tremendous amount of effort already invested in the tools. This means that I wouldn&#x27;t have to build it myself in order to get the functionality that I need. Hell, something as simple* as MonoRail&#x27;s [DataBind] can drastically reduce the amount of code that you need to write and maintain.&#xA;    At the end, the job has to be done, and insisting on trying to do it via custom code is simply NIH. There are cases where I say that whatever exists out there is not going to work for this scenario, and I roll everything from scratch, but to get to the point where the official policy is &quot;either Microsoft or hand-written stuff, nothing else&quot; - which was an actual statement made by a client to me is a long shot.&#xA;    About training, I do not think that it is too much to invest three days to a week in giving a new guy a chance to learn all the stuff that you are using. I had to bring in three new developers into my projects, none of them had any previous encounters with any of the technologies that we are using. All became productive in a very short time, one of them is exteremely annoying in managing to find the wierdest corner cases in NHibernate. They are all good developers, but I never even thought to ask them about whatever they knew about any of the stuff that we were using.&#xA;    As an aside, I keep talking about the first steps of interviews, because I stop so many interviews there, but one of the things that I do in an interview is find out what the candidate doesn&#x27;t know, and have them write something trivial with that technology. For instance, one candidate didn&#x27;t know GDI, so I asked him to draw a line on the screen.&#xA;    One of the worst candidates that I interviewed was someone that actually had NHibernate experiance, he was one of those that could not reverse a string...&#xA;    * Simple is defined in terms of usage, not implementation, the data binder is certainly not simple.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Background: I was pairing with another dev to do Watin tests for a page, we have code similar to this:            [Test]                                public void CanAddNoteToPolicy()                                {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; ie.Link(&quot;AddNote&quot;).Click();                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; ie.TextField(&quot;NoteText&quot;).TypeText(&quot;This is the comment text&quot;);                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; ie.Button(&quot;SaveNewNote&quot;).Click();                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Thread.Sleep(500);//wait for the ajax call to return                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; AssertPageContainsText(&quot;This is the comment text&quot;);                                }        The test failed, and when we investigated why, we found that it was because the call took ~1.3 seconds to complete. This is on a local machine, so I was naturally worried about it. I increased the time and the test passed, but it was still worrying that it took so long. It basically was filling an entity from the user input and saving it to the database.    I went over the code, and couldn&#x27;t really find something wrong with it, but it consistently took way more time than it should. I was about to open up a profiler when I remembered...            /// &lt;summary&gt;                        /// Notify the web service that we created a new note                        /// If completes, the web service accepted the new note and will                        /// process it in due time.                        /// If failed, the web service didn&#x27;t accept the note, probably need                        /// to fail the transaction in this case.                        /// &lt;/summary&gt;                        public virtual void BeginNoteInsertion(Note note)                                {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; //Oren: we don&#x27;t have the web service yet, so we just simulate the                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; //duration of avg call at the moment                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Thread.Sleep(1000);&#xA0;                                 }        That was some mighty head smack, I tell you that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There is an interesting debate going on in Dare&#x27;s Blog&#xA0;about the next generation of rich internet applications.    Now, Flash has some interesting capabilities, and it is probably much easier to work with than Ajax. I am thinking specifically about not having to spend 2 hours moving a div three fixels to the right in IE. The problem of Flash is that it isn&#x27;t a really good technology for doing stuff like... forms.    You know, simple stuff like accepting input from the user. It doesn&#x27;t support (OOTB) stuff like tabbing between elements, multiply languages, right to left, accessability, etc. You can do all of the above, but it takes a non trivial effort.</p>
