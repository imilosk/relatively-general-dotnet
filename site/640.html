            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was asked to comment on the use of DB schemas, so here it is. The first thing that we need to do is decide what a schema is. A schema is an organization unit inside the database. You can think about it as a folder structure with an allowed depth of 1. (Yes, just like MS-DOS 1.0). Like folders in the real file system, you can associate security attributes to the schema, and you can put items in the schema. There is the notion of the current schema, and that about it.  Well, so this is what it is. But what are we going to use if for? People are putting schemas to a lot of usages, from application segregation to versioning. In general, I think that each application should have its own database, and that versioning shouldn&#x27;t be a concern, because when you upgrade the application, you upgrade the database, and no one else has access to your database. What we are left with is security and organization. In many applications, the model layout naturally fall out into fairly well define sections. A good example is the user&#x27;s data (Users, Preferences, Tracking, etc). It is nice to be able to treat those as a cohesive unit for security purposes (imagine wanting to limit table access to the Accounting schema). It is nice, but it is not really something that I would tend to do, mostly because, again, it is only the applications that is accessing the database.  Defense in depth might cause me to have some sort of permission scheme for the database users, but that tends to be rare, and only happen when you have relatively different operation modes. What I would use schemas for is simply organization. Take a look at Rhino Security as a good example, but default, it will tack its tables into their own schema, to avoid cluttering the default schema with them. In short, I use schemas mostly for namespacing, and like namespaces elsewhere, they can be used for other things, but I find them most useful for simply adding order.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I decided to take a look at what I would take to implement static proxies (via Post Sharp) in NHibernate. The following is my implementation log.  09:30 PM - Started to work on post sharp interceptors for NHibernate 09:35 PM - Needs to learn how I can implement additional interfaces with PostSharp. 10:00 PM - Implemented ICollection&lt;T&gt; wrapping for entities 10:35 PM - Proxy Factory Factory can now control proxy validation 11:15 PM - Modified NHibernate to accept static proxies 11:28 PM - Saving Works 11:35 PM - Deleting Works 11:50 PM - Rethought the whole approach and implemented this using method interception instead of field interception 11:58 PM - Access ID without loading from DB implemented 12:01 AM - Checking IsInitialized works 12:13 AM - After midnight and I am debugging interceptions issues. 12:15 AM - It is considered bad to kill the constructor, I feel. 12:16 AM - No one needs a constructor anyway 12:30 AM - Realized that I can&#x27;t spell my own name 12:34 AM - Resorting to Console.Write debugging 12:40 AM - Wrote my own lazy initializer 12:42 AM - Realized that we can&#x27;t handle lazy loading without forwarding to a second instance, need to see how we can capture references to the this parameter using PostSharp.  12;45 AM - I think I realized what went wrong 12:55 AM - Lazy loading for non virtual property references works! 12:57 AM - Constructors are back 12:59 AM - Lazy loading for calling non virtual methods works! The first thing that I have to say is wow Post Sharp rocks! And I mean that as someone who is doing AOP for a long while, and has implemented some not insignificant parts of Castle.DynamicProxy. Leaving aside the amount of power that it gives you, PostSharp simplicity is simply amazing, wow! The second is that while things are working, it is not even an alpha release. What we have right now is, literally, one evening&#x27;s hacking. What we have now is:  Removed the requirement for virtual methods Removed the requirement for set to be an instance of Iesi.Collections.ISet&lt;T&gt;, now you can use ICollection&lt;T&gt; and HashSet&lt;T&gt;. Probably broken a lot of things Consider this a proof of concept, as you can see, it takes time to implements those things, and currently I am doing it at the expense of time better spent sleeping. I started this because I wanted to get relax up from a 12 hours coding day. If you have interest in this, please contribute to this by testing the code and seeing what breaks it. There are a bunch of TODO there that I would appreciate a second pair of eyes looking over.  You can get the code here: https://nhibernate.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/nhibernate/branches/static-proxies Note that you need to reset the project post build action to where you have PostSharp installed. Oh, and I left a joke there, see if you can find it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">PostSharp is an AOP framework that works using byte code weaving. That is, it re-writes your IL to add behaviors to it. From my point of view, it is like having the cake (interception, byte code weaving) and eating it (I haven&#x27;t even looked at the PostSharp source code, just used the binary release). My initial spike with it went very well. Here it is: [Serializable]&#xA;public class Logger : OnFieldAccessAspect&#xA;{&#xA;    public override void OnGetValue(FieldAccessEventArgs eventArgs)&#xA;    {&#xA;        Console.WriteLine(eventArgs.InstanceTag);&#xA;        Console.WriteLine(&quot;get value&quot;);&#xA;        base.OnGetValue(eventArgs);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public override InstanceTagRequest GetInstanceTagRequest()&#xA;    {&#xA;        return new InstanceTagRequest(&quot;logger&quot;, new Guid(&quot;4f8a4963-82bf-4d32-8775-42cc3cd119bd&quot;), false);&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public override void OnSetValue(FieldAccessEventArgs eventArgs)&#xA;    {&#xA;        int i = (int?)eventArgs.InstanceTag ?? 0;&#xA;        eventArgs.InstanceTag = i &#x2B; 1;&#xA;        Console.WriteLine(&quot;set value&quot;);&#xA;        base.OnSetValue(eventArgs);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;This is an aspect that run on each field access. It is not really useful, but it helps to show how things works. A couple of things that are I think are insanely useful:&#xA;&#xA;Aspects are instantiated at compile time, allowed time to set themselves up, then serialized to an resource in the assembly. At runtime, they are de-serialized and ready to run. The possibilities this give you are amazing.&#xA;InstanceTag is a way to keep additional data per aspect.&#xA;Now, let us assume that I want to add the aspect to this code:&#xA;[Logger]&#xA;public class Customer&#xA;{&#xA;    public string Name { get; set; }&#xA;}&#xA;Note, there is no field. (Well, there is, it is generated by the compiler). Now we compile and run the PostSharp post compile step. With that, we can now investigate what is going on.&#xA; &#xA;As you can see, we are deserializing the attribute and storing it in a field that we can now access. Let us check the Customer implementation now:&#xA; &#xA;We have the logger field, which is used for something, but we also have the ~get~&lt;Name&gt;k__Backingfield and ~set~&lt;Name&gt;k__BackingField. &lt;Name&gt;k__BackingField (and I would love to hear the story behind that) is the compiler generated field that was created for us. The ~get~... and ~set~ are generated by PostSharp. Before we look at them, we will look at the implementation of Name.&#xA; &#xA;Where it used to call the field directly, now it is doing this via a method call. And now we can look at those method calls.&#xA; &#xA;There is a lot going on here. We create a new field access event arg, call the aspect method, and return the value. Note that the state (instance tag) is stored in the object as well, for each field access.&#xA;It looks very well done.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post is derived from the Rhino Mocks 3.5 documentation. Setting expectations for property set was always very simple, and slightly confusing with Rhino Mocks. Here is how you do it: view.Username = &quot;the user name&quot;;&#x9;&#xA;The problem is that it is hard to see that there is an expectation created here. So, with the generous help of Sebastian Jancke, we have a new syntax:&#xA;Expect.Call(view.Username).SetPropertyWithArguments(&quot;the user name&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;This is much more explicit and easier to understand. We can also set expectation on the property set, without expecting a certain value using this syntax:&#xA;&#xA; Expect.Call(view.Username).SetPropertyAndIgnoreArguments();</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am currently working (well, sort of, more playing around) on the NHibernate Profiler. I thought that this would be a good time to describe how I approach most development tasks.   I don&#x27;t actually have the time/strength to start serious development effort, but I have the time to do a lot of spikes, and to think about architecture. If I decide to spend the time making this happen, I&#x27;ll post more about how it works.  I started with a spike about extracting the actual data from NHibernate. My target goal is being able to profile NHibernate 2.0 without having to modify NHibernate to support this. I actually run into some issues with that, more specifically, I run into technical issues with my chosen approach. Instead of spending time on troubling shooting that, I chose another path. That may not be the way it will end, but I am not interested in the technicalities at the moment, I am interested in the feasibility of the project. Suffice to say that I was successful (and learned a bit about named pipes :-) ). Next, SQL formatting is a pain, but it is something that is mandatory for a profiler, a least if you want to let the users a fighting chance in understanding what is going on. I found a solution for that as well, which I am extremely pleased with. Next is not the actual application architecture, but the user interface. That helps nailing down what the application is going to do, and cement what it is going to do. I am also a great believer of building from the top down, and the architecture that I have in mind make it very simple to split back end processing from the front end.  This is an example of what I have in mind. This is concept UI. It is not meant to be the final thing, it is here merely to give me an idea about what I am going to build. This UI was generated with the assistance of power point and paint, the disclaimer is what I usually put whenever I create a UI.  &#xA0; What you can&#x27;t see, and the purpose of the UI building exercise, is the mental model that it helped me create (the main concepts in the application are sessions, statements and warnings/suggestions). There is a streaming rule set that process those, and a whole set of functionality that just sits there in my head. The next step, at this point, is getting from a UI sketch to a working UI draft. What do I mean by that? It means building the UI (which will intentionally look ugly) and hooking it to a dummy back end. The reasoning here is quite simple. I don&#x27;t care for the look and feel at the moment, that is utterly uninteresting to me at this point, because I have seen what real UI developers can do, and I am not in their league so I am not going to even try. What I do care about in this stage is the actual operation of the UI. I can hand it over for the professionals to handle the beautification process after that part work. Of course, I feel bad about not knowing more about this, so I may spend more time there than I should, but I am going to try. After the presentation layer is done, we can start focusing on the actual back end. That is going to composed of event processing pipeline with a set of rules that I can use to provide warnings and suggestions about what to do. Still debating the interaction between the back end and the front end. Most likely this is going to be a simple ThreadSafeQueue&lt;T&gt; and that&#x27;s it. Oh, and here is the total sum of code written so far:   And if you think that this is interesting that I am not showing code, you are right, what is see is what is :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A question to my dear readers, do you find this series valuable? Do you consider it interesting? It is a significant departure from my usual set of topics.&#xA;In my recent post I wondered about the concept of summary streams, and how they related to the way CouchDB works. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what they were doing. As it turn out, there is a good documentation for them in this post. There were two things that mislead me. The first was the notion of summary. I think that this is a misnomer, because this is the only place in CouchDB where that term is used. It is not a summary, it is the actual document. As a matter of fact, I think that it is a term that was carried over from Notes.&#xA;The second misleading clue was stream. I am used to think about streams in the classic sense, as a way to access a stream of bytes. The CouchDB notion of stream is quite different. It is a way to optimize disk access, it seems. I wondered about that, because the nature of CouchDB append only file seems certain to cause a lot of issues with regards to internal fragmentation in the file (which would require a lot of seeks, which are slow).&#xA;Let me see if I can deconstruct what is going on in couch_stream, first, we have the structure declaration:&#xA;&#xA;This seems to be pretty reasonable. The write_stream is defining a reserved space in the file, note the next_alloc field. It looks like we are allocating memory (or disk space). Should be interesting. The stream structure just hold the process and the file description, and isn&#x27;t really interesting.&#xA;The initialization of a stream is interesting in itself:&#xA;&#xA;Here we just create a new write stream and copy the initialization values to the state. There seems to be a 1 to 1 mapping between a stream and an erlang process. Let us examine how we write the data. First, we have the stop condition of running out of data to write:&#xA;&#xA;You can learn a lot about the a function in erlang just from its declaration. In this case, &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; means a binary with no items in it, hence, we run out of things to write.&#xA;And now we come to the function clause that deals with the issue of running out of room to write it.&#xA;&#xA;The first part of the function is using variable binding to extract the values out of the stream. It goes against the grain, I know, to see CurrentPos being &quot;set&quot; when it is on the right side of the assignment, but that how it works. (Well, actually it isn&#x27;t being set, it is being matched, or bound, but that is another issue).&#xA;Next we find what is the next size that we have to allocate, and ask the file to expand. I don&#x27;t think that I have seen this before, let us take a look:&#xA;&#xA;We first get a the end of the file, and then we write a single byte at the end of the file plus the expansion value. In other words, we increase the length of the file by however big Num is. For .NET, this is the equivalent of the SetLength call, and it is important to create continuos files, with as little fragmentation as possible.&#xA;Going back to write_data, we have this line:&#xA;&#xA;The syntax isn&#x27;t really nice, in my opinion, but what we have here is basically: Write to the file Fd at position CurrentPos the value of NewPos (with pack to FILE_POINTER_BITS and then the value of NewSize (packed to STREAM_OFFSET_BITS).&#xA;It is important to note where this is written. Go and take a look at the case statement in which this expression is. First, we setup enough size for the data we want to write and for the next allocation. When we come to the end of the current chunk, we create a new one (by expanding the file) and then write the address of the new chunk into the end of the chunk, following that by a move to the new chunk.&#xA;The last part of write_data is very simple:&#xA;&#xA;We start by figuring out how many bytes we have to write, and then split the binary data by that. We write what we can to the file, and then recursively call ourself (which will either exit (nothing to write) or create a new chunk of the file and continue writing it.&#xA;Elegant, short and to the point. It take more time to describe how it works than it is to write the code. The code for reading is just as sweet:&#xA;&#xA;The stop condition is when we have no more data to read. The second clause is when we have run out of data to read in the current stream, and we need to read about the next one. Again, erlang&#x27;s pattern matching is useful here, because it allow to easily unpack the values from the file to in memory representation.&#xA;The last clause is where things are actually happening. We select the number of bytes to read, offset is a really misleading term here, it is not the offset from the beginning of the chunk (like most of us would think), it is the amount of bytes remaining in the current chunk.&#xA;We read the data to memory, update the Sp (stream position?) and then call the function that we were passed, to find out if we should read more or stop.&#xA;Now, how are those streams used?&#xA;From reading the code, it looks like there are two streams used in CouchDB. The first is the document stream (called the summary_stream). And the second (actually, the seconds) is a stream for all the binary attachments for a document (a stream per a set of document attachments).&#xA;And with this, we conclude the reading of CouchDB persistence architecture. Next topic, views, and how they are used.</p>
