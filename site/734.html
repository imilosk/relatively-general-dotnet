        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, I am not going to give the implementation here, but here are some notes for the implementation. What you basically need is actually quite simple.  Start with a partial query, as shown here. Instead of returning the object, return a proxy to the object, that is aware of which properties were loaded. When a property is accessed that is not in the loaded properties list, do the following:  Load the real object using NHibernate. Copy the existing values from the current object to the newly loaded one. (Preserving state) Redirect all calls to the newly loaded object. The whole thing is quite simple, once you think about it from the right angle. Then again, here talks the guy who spent two hours debugging why calling the wrong machine would fail.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Aaron still wants partial object queries, so I set up to build them using NHibernate. Here is the implementation, notice that this query will result in a list of Blog instances, but the select will only include their titles &amp; subtitles. using (ISession session = sessionFactory.OpenSession())&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;TupleToPropertyResultTransformer transformer = &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;new TupleToPropertyResultTransformer(typeof(Blog),&quot;Title&quot;, &quot;Subtitle&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;IList list = session.CreateQuery(&quot;select b.Title, b.Subtitle from Blog b&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;.SetResultTransformer(transformer)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;.List();&#xA;&#x9;foreach (Blog b in list)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Blog: {0} - {1}&quot;, b.Title, b.Subtitle);&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;But where does TupleToPropertyResultTransformer comes from, well, that is where the magic comes in, here is my implementation for it:&#xA;public class TupleToPropertyResultTransformer : IResultTransformer&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;private Type result;&#xA;&#x9;private PropertyInfo[] properties;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public TupleToPropertyResultTransformer(Type result, params string[] names)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;this.result = result;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;List&lt;PropertyInfo&gt; props = new List&lt;PropertyInfo&gt;();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;foreach (string name in names)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;props.Add(result.GetProperty(name));&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;properties = props.ToArray();&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public object TransformTuple(object[] tuple, string[] aliases)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;object instance = Activator.CreateInstance(result);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;for (int i = 0; i &lt; tuple.Length; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;properties[i].SetValue(instance, tuple[i], null);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return instance;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public IList TransformList(IList collection)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return collection;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;This isn&#x27;t the most optimized version that you can think of, but it does the job.&#xA;I want to make it clear, however, that I feel that doing stuff like this is not something that I would consider to be a best practice. Quite the opposite, frankly. What we have here is an object in a state that it was never intended to be, with only part of its fields filled, and certainly not based on any logic. I would much rather see a DTO class take its place, because that has a clear responsibility in the application, reusing your entities as dumb data container is not something that I would recommend.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, it looks like I have once again managed to put myself in a tricky spot. I have the following scenario:  Domains: A1 &amp; A2 - no trust or any association between the two. A user access a Website on A1, using windows authentication, which makes a web service call to a machine on domain A2 (anonymous security, at the moment). As a result of the web service call, the machine on A2 needs to make another web service call to A1, and it needs to do it with windows authentication, with the credentials of the original user. Now, I have control on the machine in A1 (.Net 1.1 ASMX WebServices) and I can do whatever I want to the machine in A2 (WCF). No trust between the domains, as I said, so I don&#x27;t think that I can make Windows Authentication works between the two. Frankly, I don&#x27;t care about authenticating users, I just need their credentials when I am going back to the machine in A1. Any suggestions?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Aaron (Eleutian) is talking about some issues that he has with optimizing with NHibernate.  So in short, I feel NHibernate (and any ORM for that matter) needs the following features to really be optimization friendly:  Lazy field initialization  Querying for partial objects: select u(Username, Email) from User u Read-only queries that do not get flushed.  Join qualifiers (on in T-SQL) Let me try to take this in order. Lazy Field Initialization: On the surface, it looks very good, because you can do something like:   Customer customer = session.Load&lt;Customer&gt;(15);Console.Write(customer.Name); And the OR/M would generate this SQL:  SELECT Name FROM Customers where Id = @p0; @p0 = 15; That sounds fine, until you realize that the database roundtrip is far more expensive than loading a single row, even if you load all its columns (leaving BLOB aside for now). This means that it is usually much more efficient to load the entire row at a single go, rather than piecemeal. I tried to toy a bit with the way you would do that, and I can&#x27;t really think of a good way to handle it without causing major management issues for the OR/M user. That said, it is a feature that can be very valuable if you make it optional, per field basis. That way, you can have a customer object that contains a Photo BLOB column, and have it accessible only when needed, yet keep the natural programming model. Partial object queries Well, NHibernate has that:  select new UserSummaryDetails(u.Username, u.Email) from User u It will return a list of UserSummaryDetails that you can use. As an aside, they are also not tracked by NHibernate. Real Only Queries Those are actually fairly simple to implement, you just need something like:  ISession tempSession = factory.OpenSession( currentSession.Connection );tempSession.FlushMode = FlushMode.Never;results = tempSession.CreateCriteria(typeof(Customer)).List();tempSession.Dispose(); Abstract that to a helper function and you are set. Another option is to use SetResultTranformer to inject an modifier that will evict the instance from the session (which has its own issues). Join Qualifiers From a few experiments that I have done, there is not difference on the query plan if you are using ANSI joins or where clause joins. This is one solution to the problem. Another issue would be what syntax to choose. NHibernate would need to map that to all the relevant databases, which may not always support ANSI joins. Not simple answer there, but the HQL Parser that we are building should make it more accessible to developers to go in and change it.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Scott McMaster&#xA0;equates HTML to assembly. I find it amusing because one of the design goals of HTML is to be accessible to anyone, and I do believe that it has served that job in a very good manner. Scott suggests that higher level abstractions such as control toolkits will take the place of HTML in the future. I do not agree, mainly because I have seen how painful such approaches can be when you want to simply generate HTML. Remember, for an abstraction to be useful, it has to give me a significant advantage over the existing approach, and it shouldn&#x27;t limit me overmuch. HTML is dead simple, so I don&#x27;t see much value with that, and since no control toolkit can give me what I want, and since when I need to add additional stuff, I want it to be simple, I don&#x27;t really see much value in going in that direction. What is possible is that technologies such as Flash / Silverlight would become much more pervasive and allow us to move from HTML documents to more elaborate methods of communicating with the user.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Mats Helander is in love with WebForms, and he explains why. I think that I have already explained why I don&#x27;t agree with that, but allow me to go over his points. One important thing to notice is that Mats ignore the problem of &quot;WebForms tries to be WinForms&quot;, because, as he says, that is usually an issue raised to explain the root cause WebForms problems.  I think that this is a mistake, because the rest of the problems in WebForms are non as critical as the issue of trying to be WinForms. And the main problem there is state. The web is stateless, windows is stateful. Once you break that basic concept, you already in a world of hurt.  I am much more in love with the WebForms model, which in my opinion is beautiful, efficient, powerful, flexible, scalable, portable, un-obtrusive, perfect for spitting out html, has a really well designed page lifecycle and it jives very nicely with MVC thank-you-very-much  I was going to try to formulate an answer to that myself, but I think that I will let Mats&#x27; own word handle that:  The WebForms page lifecycle model is too complex to wrap your head around Well, ok, it is. But it is also really, really good. I freely admit that whenever I need to do something more complex than implement Page_Load and the event handlers of controls, I get totally lost. But when I eventually get it to work &#x2013; by luck, swearing and occult sacrifice &#x2013; I must admit I am impressed with the results. And after saying that, you still think that you can call it good?! That is my definition of Hell. Building software should be predictable, maintainable and obvious. I don&#x27;t have an issue with learning complex stuff, but needing occult sacrifice (which I have felt the need as well) to get it to work is out of the question. To quote Paul Graham:  It&#x27;s pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting: those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have to solve a lot of nasty little ones. One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that&#x27;s full of bugs. Another is when you have to customize something for an individual client&#x27;s complex and ill-defined needs. To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand cuts. Sorry, just that is enough to keep me away from WebForms. Mats then talks about using the DOM that WebForms provides:  Say that you were asked to implement the following method: &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; public string SerializeToXml(Employee employee); There are two obvious ways to do this: StringBuilder Using a StringBuilder object (or a plain string) you simply build up the xml as a string, doing things like stringBuilder.Append(&#x201C;[name]&#x201D; &#x2B; employee.Name &#x2B; &#x201C;[/name]&#x201D;); XmlDocument Using an XmlDocument object you build up your xml as a Document Object Model (DOM), doing things like xmlNodeEmployee.ChildNodes.Append(xmlNodeName); When asked to implement the following method, you have the same basic choice: &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; public string SerializeToHtml(Employee employee); You can either use a StringBuilder and just build up the html as a string, or you can build up a DOM representation of your html. Mu! I can also do the smart thing and use a templating language. Using XmlDocument to generate XML is tedious in the extreme, because the DOM is built to the document model, not to ease the way we build XML. There is a reason why Orcas has a whole new set of ways to work with XML, because going the DOM approach is just too awkward. As anyone who has ever worked with AST / DOM can tell you, just because it is the way the computer thinks that way, it does not means that this is the best way to generate it. If I wanted to generate XML, I would much prefer to use something like BooML&#xA0;than XmlDocument. Take a look at the differences:  [XmlLiteral()]&#xA;def GetBooksXml(books):&#xA;    books:&#xA;        for book as Book in books:&#xA;            book:&#xA;                @id = book.Id&#xA;                title book.Title&#xA;                author book.Author&#xA;The same goes for generating HTML. The DOM is a very awkward way to handle it.&#xA;&#xA0;Mats then raise several cases where having a DOM is useful. Multiply outputs and wanting to delete an existing node after the fact are two of the issues he raises, he then says:&#xA;&#xA;The problem, in my view, with going with a platform that doesn&#x2019;t offer the flexibility of a DOM is that you don&#x2019;t have the option the day it would become useful.&#xA;I would say YAGNI to that, while adding that if you want it, it is already there. In MonoRail it is DSL Support for Brail, in Ruby on Rails it is Haml. Here is how it looks like:&lt;?brail&#xA;dsl Html:&#xA;&#x9;body:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;component SmartGridComponent, {&quot;source&quot; : names}&#xA;&#x9;end&#xA;end&#xA;?&gt;&#xA;Right now it does direct calls&#xA0;to HTML, but it is trivially possible to add HtmlDOM implementation, and handle that. &#xA;Mats has this to say on the page lifecycle complexity issue:&#xA;&#xA;So my response to this accusation is to say that the complexity is usually hidden from the application developer.&#xA;Really? Take a repeater and put a button in the ItemTemplate, with an OnClick handler to a method. Now DataBind it, send it to the client, and press on one of those buttons. A postback occurs, but the event is not raised. Why?&#xA;This is just one of several hundreds of examples that I have where, as an application developer, I need to intimately understand the page lifecycle model and how it affects me. I don&#x27;t really think that you can say that that an app dev is free from having to always deal with that on all but the simplest page.&#xA;Here is another telling statement:&#xA;&#xA;Since it is too complex for me to understand, I really couldn&#x2019;t make a judgment&#xA;Mats wrote an OR/M&#xA0; implementation, which is one complex piece of software. I have a lot of personal respect for that, since I know what is involved in making such an effort. If he can&#x27;t grasp the page lifecycle, what is the chance that most developers would be able to?&#xA;&#xA0;WebForms and MVC&#xA;I have talked about the issues that WebForms MVC has extensively here, but I can surmise it simply as: There is no way for the controller to know that a user has pressed a button without the view being involved, or to build a Controller that doesn&#x27;t need to be modified to fit the page lifecycle.&#xA;You can see how I think about the flow of a request using an MVC platform in the image. Notice that the view is the last thing that is involved, since it is not an important player until the very very end.&#xA;One thing that come up as a result of that is that a lot of the DOM manipulation games that Mats talks so much about are simply not necessary when you are using an MVC architecture, it is not needed because you know, in advance of building the view, exactly what you need to do.&#xA;I have done extensive work in this area, and my conclusion is that it is simply not possible to get separation from the view layer in WebForms, it is built into the platform, and cannot be changed.&#xA;Conclusion, while Mats may have intended to support the WebForm model, but I think that he had managed to bring up the points where using WebForms hurts.&#xA;And, as the joke says, stop doing that.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When J2EE came around, the notion of a container and managed objects / entities&#xA0;came into the fray, but those had such a high cost associated with them, that the Java community rebelled and now mainly advocates the Plain Old Java Objects. The .NET community has taken the same approach recently, with POCO or PONO being the term used. This post is driven by my experiences with several of Microsoft&#x27;s tools that tend to focus on &quot;No Code Required&quot;. WebForms&#x27; 2.0 had a huge marketing focus on that, and MS CRM is being sold with the premise that you can extend it with just a GUI, so does many others tools from Microsoft (SSIS comes to mind). I outlined the problems that I see with this model here, so I will not repeat it here, but I want to focus on code vs. GUI right now. I am aware of only a single such tool that provide a really good service, and that is the WinForms designer, and even that fails occasionally. But what really gets me is the CRM&#x27;s style of designers, where the customization is locked tight somewhere, where I cannot access it in any meaningful way. Given the chance, I would define customization with code, probably a DSL, and probably something like this:  entity MyCustomerCustomer:&#xA;&#x9;CustomerNumber as int&#xA;&#x9;[Length(255)]&#xA;&#x9;Name as string&#xA;&#x9;Email as Email&#xA;&#xA;screen MainView, for: MyCustomerCustomer:&#xA;&#x9;tab &quot;Customer Properties&quot;:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Display Name&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Display Email&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Display CustomerNumber, readonly&#xA;Hm, I seem to getting back to DSL no matter which way I go recently.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Like many people who work with computers a lot, I suffer from wrist pain. I recently switched to using a Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000, and it reduced those issues very quickly. The main benefit of the keyboard, aside from the ergonomic, split, design, is that it is&#xA0; raised, which mean that my wrists doesn&#x27;t have to bend in order to use the keyboard. I have found that this to be a great product, with the single complaint that the wrist rest hand doesn&#x27;t stretch enough to the left, so I have no easy way to access the left most keys column of the keyboard. I literally need an extra inch or two and it would be perfect. Now I am looking for a mouse that I can use that will not reduce the effort even more. I would like to be able to go totally mouse free, and while I can do it, the problem is that this is simply not possible in many applications. In Windows Live Writer, for instance, I don&#x27;t have any way to access the right option bar without the mouse (at least non that I could find), and that is the case in many applications / sites. Selecting categories or setting publish date requires the use of the mouse as well. I have tried using a trackball for a while, and that didn&#x27;t reduce any wrist pain, if anything, it simply moved them from one place to another.  Any recommendation on a good mouse to use? I have heard about data-hands, and I am interesting in taking them for a spin, but the cost is really prohibitive, and I am not going to even try that without seeing clear benefits out of this.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This strip&#xA0;had me LOL, because it is such a true description of the way most customers want to think. I am dealing with this issue by telling the customer that if they don&#x27;t give me a priority scale that I can work with, I am going to implement the system using my own prioritization method, which is based on the technical fun factor of a particular feature, and that I don&#x27;t consider UI to be fun, ever. That tends to get me a list of features for the next week or two :-) More seriously, though, I am posting this mostly as a way to remember to send this to the next customer that tries to take this approach. My last customer was a pleasure to work with, because he was the rare combination of a technical guy with a good sense of the business, so we could discuss anything from implementation strategy to feature prioritization based on internal dependencies and the business need. I think I need the non PHB award.</p>
