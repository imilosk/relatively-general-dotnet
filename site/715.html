        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After reading about Erlang, I got very excited about doing hot code swapping, and always on applications. I decided that this is something that would be cool to do on the CLR. So I did, it was very easy. The screen cast is a short one, less than 25 minutes, but it covers all the concepts, and we have dynamically updated code in the end. :-) As usual, the sound quality is suspicious, and I am probably speaking to fast.

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We are discussing the ideal IDE on the Alt.Net mailing list, I thought that it would be interesting to gather all the requirements in one place.  I made some minimal attempt to reduce duplication, and to put the interesting parts, but check the discussion, it is still going on. This is not a list of &quot;what is wrong with VS&quot;, it is a list of things that we want to see in an IDE (or not see in an IDE :-) ). IDE is defined as the place where I write code / debug /test.  Good quotes:  I want to be a train speeding full steam and have this IDE laying track just in front of me until such time as I tell it I want to go a different direction.  I just want a lightening fast intelligent editor that will let me choose to add on the features I care about. I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with lag time.  Give me something like TextMate for .NET. Build it on managed code. Make the AST model/API sensible and self-evident. Provide a user-centricity driven plugin model - no abstracterbation for programmers with technology fetishes. Plain, simple, self-evident. Extensibility and usability for the merest of mere mortals.  So, do you really need Snippet Compiler with ReSharper editing features and debugger?  And now to the real stuff that was mentioned:  Coding:  Syntax highlighting  Intellisense (I may think I am a jedi but true zen is to talk to the machine and have it put forth the words before you)  Code Browsing  Refactoring  Treat Warnings as Errors as not negotiable (always enabled).  i want it to be geared towards the keyboard developer.  Text manipulation:  Regex manipulation of the text.  Debugger, good one.   Edit and continue Testing integration Setting up all the required stuff, what is compiled, embedded, etc.   Preferably it should read my build script and work on top of that.  i want the build system to be pluggable  i want a light project structure. If anything is going to be stored in a file it needs to be in a readable form and would preferable have a lightweight API that ships with it.  Source control integration - nice, but not really a must have, I use tortoise for that.   Some opinions said that SCM should not be in the IDE. Extensible  Should be able to add a new language easily.  Should offer me the AST of the code when I build a plugin.  Make it have a light version, where you can unplug stuff you find unnecessary. ??  So as far as an IDE is concerned I want to do everything from inside it like deployments  Smarts:  Error highlighting (errors, warnings, test failures, bad practices, ...)  A Code Smell detection system (users could extend it with CQL)  i want it to give me visual cues to interesting code constructs  All existing R# features  IDE support for effect analysis (Chapter 11 of Working Effectively with Lagacy Code).  automatically correct these issues: flase &gt; false, reslut = result, retrun = return  User interface:  Full screen ability  Background compilation as you type (I hate waiting for VS to compile my solutions all the time).  Code searching:  A very fast way to get from the current function you are in to any caller or to any function the function is calling (and class definitions, ...)  Ability to instantly search for a specific artifact (kind of like google / windows live search). As I type it in, I see the filtered results. This is NOT the find feature. Misc:  The ability to have 2 people working in separate window panes on the same file (one person typing on the local keyboard/mouse, the other in a remote desktop); both visible in the same environment.  IDE installation &lt; 100Mb  Shell integration would be nice. and available from the keyboard (think launchy)  For windows PowerShell integration would be nice too.  How about an IDE that doesn&#x2019;t lock up when the source control is unavailable ;)  better multiple monitor support.  Configuration screens that don&#x2019;t give me a headache Responsive:  I am willing to pay for a quad core computer with 16 GB RAM, and use that for only programming. But it _must_ be responsive. (I used VS.Net on such a system, it crawled!)  FAST FAST FAST  Designers:  i don&#x27;t want any of the overhead of a designer.  Designers that don&#x2019;t break or no designers at all Built in (no separate window) reflector   I should be able to CTRL&#x2B;B from the method to the code or to the disassembled code. Release cycle:  I want an IDE which is released early and often. And I want an IDE built by a team which is responsive to community feedback. The rest is just details.  Multiple Releases a year, constant improvement.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Udi has an interesting presentation&#xA0;that I recommend that you go through. He is going to present it at Tech Ed (Thu Nov 8 13:30 - 14:45 Room 117). Most of the ideas are familiar to me because I have spoken to him about them before, but it represent new concepts to most people. I would preface his suggestion with the usual warning about designing for performance. Udi&#x27;s points are about big systems, so consider if they are appropriate to your scenario first. A pal of mine once told me that he designs systems for an order of magnitude increase in the requirements. So a system that works for a hundred users should also scale to a thousand users (additional hardware, maybe, but the architecture should hold), but going beyond that will require more than just throwing hardware at the issue. This sounds like a good rule of the thumb.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Adam&#xA0;has an interesting discussion here about handling common actions in MonoRail. This has sparked some discussion&#xA0;in the MonoRail mailing list. I wanted to take the chance to discuss the idea in more detail here. Basically, he is talking about doing this:  public class IndexAction : SmartDispatcherAction&#xA;{&#xA;   private ISearchableRepository repos;&#xA;   private string indexView;&#xA;&#xA;   public IndexAction(&#xA;      ISearchableRepository repos,&#xA;      string indexView)&#xA;   {&#xA;      this.repos = repos;&#xA;      this.indexView = indexView;&#xA;   }&#xA;&#xA;   public void Execute(string name)&#xA;   {&#xA;      ISearchable item = repos.FindByName(name);&#xA;      if(item == null)&#xA;      {&#xA;         PropertyBag[&quot;UnknownSearchTerm&quot;] = name;&#xA;         RenderView(&quot;common/unknown_quick_search&quot;);&#xA;      }&#xA;&#xA;      PropertyBag[&quot;Item&quot;] = item;&#xA;      RenderView(indexView);&#xA;   }&#xA;}&#xA;And then registering it with the routing engine like this:&#xA;new Route(&quot;/products/&lt;name&gt;&quot;,&#xA;    new IndexAction(new ProductRepository(), &quot;display_product&quot;));&#xA;new Route(&quot;/categories/&lt;name&gt;&quot;,&#xA;    new IndexAction(new CategoryRepository(), &quot;display_category&quot;));&#xA;Now, accessing &quot;/categories/cars&quot; will give you all the items in the cars category.&#xA;On the face of it, it seems like a degenerated controller, no? Why do we need it? We can certainly map more than a single URL to a controller, so can&#x27;t we solve that problem that way?&#xA;Let us stop for a moment and think about the MVC model. Where did it come from? From Smalltalk, when GUI was something brand new &amp; sparkling. It is a design pattern for a connected system. In that case, the concept of a controller made a lot of sense.&#xA;But when we are talking about the web? The web is a disconnected world. What is the sense in having a controller there? An Action, or a Command, pattern seems much more logical here, no?&#xA;  But then we have things that just doesn&#x27;t fit this model. Consider the example of CRUD on orders. We can have a controller, which will handle all of the logic for this use case in a single location, or we can have four separate classes, each taking care of a single aspect of the use case.&#xA;Personally, I would rather have the controller to do the work in this scenario, because this way I have all the information in a single place, and I don&#x27;t need to hunt multiply classes in order to find it.&#xA;But, there are a lot of cases where we do want to have just this single action to happen, or maybe we want to add some common operations to the controller, without having to get in to crazy inheritance schemes.&#xA;For this, MonoRail supports the idea of Dynamic Actions, which supports seamless attachment of actions to a controller.&#xA;Hammett describe them best:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;DynamicActions offers a way to have an action that is not a method in the controller. This way you can &#x201C;reuse an action&#x201D; in several controllers, even among projects, without the need to create a complex controller class hierarchy.&#xA;The really interesting part in this is that we have both IDynamicAction and IDynamicActionProvider. This means that we get mixin-like capabilities.&#xA;Dynamic Actions didn&#x27;t get all the love they probably deserve, we don&#x27;t have the SmartDispatcherAction (yet), so if we want to use them, we will need to handle with the raw request data, rather than with the usual niceties that MonoRail provides.&#xA;Nevertheless, on a solid base it is easy enough to add.&#xA;Now all we need to solve is the ability to route the requests to the correct action, right? This is notepad code, so it is ugly and not something that I would really use, but it does the job:&#xA;public class ActionRoutingController : Controller&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public delegate IDynamicAction CreateDynamicAction();&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;public static IDictionary&lt;string, CreateDynamicAction&gt; Routing &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;= new Dictionary&lt;string, CreateDynamicAction&gt;();&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;protected override void InternalSend(string action, IDictionary actionArgs)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;if(Routing.ContainsKey(action) == )&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;throw new NoActionFoundException(action);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Routing[action]().Execute(this);&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;What this means is that you can now do this:&#xA;public void AddRoutedActions()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;AddRoutedAction(&quot;categories&quot;, &quot;/categories/&lt;name:string&gt;&quot;, delegate {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return  new IndexAction(new CategoryRepository(), &quot;display_category&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;});&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;AddRoutedAction(&quot;products&quot;, &quot;/products/&lt;name:string&gt;&quot;, delegate {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return new IndexAction(new ProductRepository(), &quot;display_product&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;});&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public void AddRoutedAction(string action, string url, CreateDynamicAction actionFactory)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;RoutingModuleEx.Engine.Add(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;PatternRule.Build(action, url, typeof(ActionRoutingController), action));&#xA;    &#xA;    ActionRoutingController.Routing.Add(action, actionFactory);&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;}&#xA;And get basically the same result.&#xA;Again, all of this is notepad code, just doodling away, but it is nice to see that all the building blocks are there.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Rob Conery has just announced&#xA0;that he is going to work for Microsoft. That is&#xA0;interesting, but not really surprising or shocking. Microsoft does seems to hire a lot of the&#xA0;bloggers in the .Net space. What is surprising is the role that he is expected to fill in Microsoft. He is going to work full time on SubSonic, an Open Source project. Why is this surprising? Because to date, I haven&#x27;t heard of any other cases where Microsoft have paid for developers to work full time on OSS that didn&#x27;t came directly from Microsoft. This is a fairly common model in the OSS world, but this is the first time that Microsoft has made such a move. Very welcome move from Microsoft, and congratulations to Rob.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Sharing common functionality across controllers is something that I have run into several times in the past. It is basically needing to offer the same functionality across different elements in the application. Let us take for a moment a search page. In my current application, a search page has to offer rich search functionality for the user, the ability to do pattern matching, so given a certain entity, match all the relevant related entities that can fit this entity. Match all openings for a candidate. Match all candidates for an opening. That is unique, mostly, but then we have a lot of boiler plate functionality, which moves from printing, paging, security, saving the query and saving the results, changing the results, exporting to XML, loading saved queries and saved results, etc, etc etc. Those requirements are shared among several  On the right you can see one solution for this problem, the Template Controller pattern. Basically, we concentrated all the common functionality into the Base Specification Controller. What you can&#x27;t see is that the declaration of the controller also have the following generic constraints: public class BaseSpecificationController&lt;TSpecification, TEntity&gt; : BaseController&#xA;&#x9;where TSpecification : BaseSpecification&lt;TEntity&gt;, new()&#xA;&#x9;where TEntity : IIdentifable&#xA;This means that the base controller can perform most of its actions on the base classes, without needing to specialize just because of the different types.&#xA;Yes, dynamic language would makes things much easier, I know.&#xA;Note that while I am talking about sharing the controller logic here, between several controllers, we can also do the same for the views using shared views. Or not. That is useful if we want to use different UI for the search.&#xA;In fact, given that we need to show a search screen, it is not surprising that we would need a different UI, and some different behavior for each search controller, to get the data required to specify a search.&#xA;Now that we have the background all set up, let us see what we can do with the concrete search controllers, shall we.&#xA;You can see the structure of them on the right. The search candidates is doing much more than the search orders, but a lot of the functionality between the two is shared. And more importantly, easily shared.&#xA;Well, if you define the generics syntax above as easy, at least.&#xA;The main advantage of this approach is that I can literally develop a feature on the candidates controller, and then generalize it to support all the other searches in the application.&#xA;In this scenario, we started with searching for candidates, and after getting the basic structure done, I moved to start working on the search orders.&#xA;At the same time, another guy was implementing all the extra functionality (excel export, sending SMS and emails, etc).&#xA;After we I finished the search order page, we merged and refactored up most of the functionality that we needed in both places.&#xA;This is a good approach if you can utilize inheritance in your favor. But there is a kink, if you want to aggregate functionality from several sources, then you are going to go back to delegation or duplication.&#xA;Adam has interesting discussion about this issue, and an interesting proposition. But that will be another post.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Occasionally I get to try something that sounds really good, but it falls on the execution because of the small details. Let us take FireFox Prism&#xA0;as an example. The idea is good, I get a separate fire fox window just for gmail, or other always on apps. Note that I am using it as an example only, because I just run into it. Prism is still in beta, so it is just an example. This means that if the browser crash I don&#x27;t lose my unsaved email, and more importantly, I can close FireFox (and thus release the memory) without closing my mail. Here is why I wouldn&#x27;t be using it for now: &#xA0;   Can you spot the difference between the two images?  The Prism one is on the left, FireFox is on the right. The Gmail on Prism doesn&#x27;t display a caret symbol in Gmail&#x27;s rich edit box. That is a deal breaker for me, because I can&#x27;t really type without it.  I. Can&#x27;t. Type. Without. The. Caret. Period. The point that I am trying to make is that you need to consider the deal breakers for the user. And even something as small as the caret is a deal breaker. In my last project, the first release was completely useless to some of the users, because a select list didn&#x27;t contains all the old values, and we couldn&#x27;t bring those values, because their presence depended on so many other things. Those users had to wait for the second release to use the application. Deal breakers are the other side of the killer features, and are just as important when you analyze a solution. Examples of deal breakers in typical software include:  Not supporting the old application&#x27;s keyboard shortcuts  Web application replacing local app - latency  Different fonts (True story!&#xA0; Priority 0 bug!)  Compatibilities</p>
