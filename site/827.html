        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I hope that this post will reach more than the usual readers of this blog, so let me introduce my open source resume:I am an active&#xA0;member (committer) of two big open source projects, NHibernate and Castle, own an open source project, Rhino Mocks&#xA0;(which is a part of Rhino Tools, a bigger OSS effort), and a&#xA0;semi-active member of an open source lagnauge on .Net, Boo. I am a heavy user of open source tools (Subversion, trac, log4net, nunit, nant,&#xA0;cuyahoga, dasblog, to mention just a few).&#xA0; I have been actively involved in the open source community in the .Net world for over three&#xA0;years.    I am not a zealot , you will not find me waving the GPL flag and stroming Microsoft HQ to liberate the captive code there. I do believe in open source software, and in the value of a community around the basic blocks of software.    The open source community in .Net is big, but it is only a fraction of the size of the open source community in other environments (Java, for instnace), compared to the number of users. This issue has been raised several times, it is certainly not a new one. Enough time has passed since .Net 1.0 was released to make the old excuses about &quot;.Net is new&quot;, or &quot;the Java guys has a lot more time to experiment with stuff&quot; to lose any strength.    This disparity can be explained by looking at the basic facts of the .Net community. .Net has a central vendor (Mono is marginal at best), Microsoft. This puts Microsoft in a position where they have the ear of every .Net developer, team lead and architect (to say nothing about PHBs). And Microsoft isn&#x27;t doing anything to foster a healthy OSS community around .Net.    What do I mean by not doing anything to help build an OSS community? Let us look at the Java land, and take a couple of OSS projects there, shall we? JUnit and Ant are two good examples, both of those are examples of projects built by the community, to solve problems that their developers were facing. What is the current status of those projects in the Java land? Well, they have excellent tool support by all the major IDEs, they are accepted as the way you do things in Java. This is a common theme in the Java world, actually. Hibernate and EJB 3.0 are another example, and I am pretty sure that I can carry on for quite a while.    Due to the distributed nature of Java (no single source, even though Sun can dictate stuff), the libraries and tools are competing on merit, and usually the best tools (best may also mean the first, btw) are accepted as the basis from which further work is done.    In .Net, however, the situation is far different. Let us take the same example&#xA0; in .Net, we have both NUnit and NAnt in the .Net world. In 2005, Microsoft came with Visual Studio 2005, which included similar technologies to both NUnit and NAnt.     The answer to NAnt was MsBuild, which is based on the same principals of NAnt (xml based, declarative, extendable, etc). Now, to be fair to Microsoft, NAnt is GPL&#x27;ed, so technically they can&#x27;t use it for Visual Studio. I am sure that they could have work something with the developers.    The answer to NUnit was MS Test, which has the same model as NUnit (attributes based, etc). It has incompatible syntax with NUnit (or any other .Net Unit Testing framework), and is severly limited&#xA0;compared to NUnit. In this case, NUnit has a commercial friendly license, so Microsoft could certainly have used it.    Now, a developer on the .Net platform has to choose between NUnit vs. MS Test, NAnt vs. MsBuild, etc. Microsoft&#x27;s tools tend to come with a lot more tools, including fancy UI, wizards, etc. The problem is that when you need to make a change in those tools, you have a lot of wieght to move. Take for example the Abstract Test Case which MS Test doesn&#x27;t support. At the core, it is an issue of removing BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly from the code that selects the test methods to execute. The problem is that Microsoft can&#x27;t do that, they need to change the UI, the wizards, etc to be able to support this.&#xA0;Suddenly a very easy change turns into a big undertaking, with implications that can cost quite a bit of money and time.     You can see this pattern repeated over and over if you just take a look at the OSS tools that Microsoft is trying to replace with its own. Some quick examples from the top of my head:            NDoc and Sandcastle (again, NDoc is GPL&#x27;ed, again, I am pretty sure that they could have talked with the developer to change the license).                 Log4net and the Logging Application Block.                 Castle Windsor/Spring.Net and Object Builder.         I get the sense that a lot of time, a functionality that already exists in the open (often with license that allows commercial use) is being passed on because it is not from Microsoft. The only OSS Project that I know of that is going to be integrated into the toolset is the WIX installer, which is a Microsoft project.    What I would have liked to see is Microsoft working with the OSS community to provide better tools for developers based on the best-of-breed tools that already exists. There is nothing more annoying than having to learn (again) how to write a build script to automate the deployment of a project, but in MsBuild instead of NAnt. Or remembering to put [TestClass] instead of [TestFixture].    I do not want new products from Microsoft that does the same thing as existing OSS products. They don&#x27;t have the same level of maturity as an OSS project that is several years old, and I hate the answer &quot;Well, it may not do [critical feature that I need] like [oss does], but this is Microsoft, and it will definately do it in the next version.&quot; (which I got for several times, for several different products, from Microsoft people / consultants).     I think that saying this is tantamount to saying: &quot;We built an inferior product, missing critical features that you need. We inversted in [better UI / integration with Office / etc] and didn&#x27;t get to this. We are Microsoft, so you will use our stuff anyway, and maybe we will fix it next version&quot;. I want to see official Microsoft people recommending the use of OSS products like NHibernate, instead of saying &quot;do it manually, or wait a year and do it in LINQ&quot;. There are a good number of projects that sprung up in the .Net ecosystem to fill in voids in what Microsoft is offerring. Duplicating this functionality is a waste of energy. Both for Microsoft and the community.    Microsoft should leverage the successful open source projects to make life easier for developers. The Java model is a very compelling one. Let us take leave of ours senses for a moment and assume that Microsoft has decided that it wants to add support for NHibernate in Visual Studio. What would happen? Better documentations, a lot more samples, probably better, easier tools. The core functionality would remain, and a whole new fucntionality would be added. Everyone would benefit (well, maybe except the DLinq team :-) ).    Returning to the real world,&#xA0;the OSS community in .Net biggest weakness is that the OSS community doesn&#x27;t include Microsoft itself. And no, CodePlex doesn&#x27;t really count. CodePlex doesn&#x27;t bring Microsoft and OSS togetherer in the sense that it is not a place from which things go into the CLR or into the standard tool set. To take a simple example, the Mvp.Xml project. It contains functionality that is essential to heavy users of XML on .Net (of which I am not, btw). Was there any code migrated from Mvp.Xml to System.Xml? Would there be any such code?    As it stands today, I don&#x27;t think that this is likely. I would like to change this attidute from Microsoft.    Some interesting links on this subject are from a discussion a few months back about whatever microsoft should financially support OSS projects (link 1, link 2, link 3).</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I do a lot of communicating about technical stuff, sometimes with our own developer teams, sometimes with clients, and sometimes with just random dev groups that I get to meet (user groups, email, IM, etc).     Almost invariably, whenever I talk to them about the way they built their projects (I hate the word architecture), I got through the following stages:            This isn&#x27;t how I would do this...            Oh, My God!            Why are you doing this??            Oh, I see.            Hm...            Just let me think about it a moment            So, what you are doing is actually XYZ beause of ABC.            Nice...    The best part of talking tech is that I keep learning so many new approachs to solve the same problems under different constraints.    Of course, there is another variant for the above scenario, Legacy code:            Bloody Hell! (someone please show me the exit, now).            I want the home address of the guy who wrote this file, oh, and a pair of thumb screws...            There goes the week/month/year...</p>

They had a lot of resistance to use something that is not Microsoft, and is open source to boot*. That email contained a fix for NH-736, which I closed some time ago, thinking it was fixed (it was, for queries, but not for entities).&#xA0; I haven&#x27;t got them to the point that they are making patches yet, but this looks like a very good step in the right direction.    * Yes, I know, I don&#x27;t understand this approach either.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As I mentioned, there is not a very interesting discussion on the Castle Developer mailing list.    One of the topics that just came up is evangelizing Castle to the community. I think that the main problem of Castle is that it help solves the problems that you have after you finished 30% of the project. That is when you start discoverring the limits of the stuff that MS is preaching. It takes prior experiance with this pain to make the trade off visible. I know that in the past I have talked about the seperation of UI / business logic that is inherent to MonoRail, and I got responses like: &quot;Well, that is why we have code-behind files in ASP.Net&quot;.    I wasn&#x27;t sure quite how to deal with that argument then. Every now and then I see people who are fortunate enough to build applications where the UI is truly just the ASPX and maybe a single line or two of databinding in the code behind. But my experiance is that I often need to do complex stuff in the UI. For instnace, show certain rows in a grid with a certain color, Ajax, etc. All of which are intimately tied to the UI, and are not possible to do in the ASPX. This means that they go to the code behind file, and there goes the Seperation of Concerns out the window. I have seen a date picker control that is over 2,500 lines of code. And even in this simple control, there was some business logic involved (mostly around what valid dates are, and how to handle ranges of them.    Anyway, this discussion coincides with a request from a friend to send some information about how to sell Active Record to their team lead / architects. I uploaded the presentation to my Presentations page, so feel free to start pitching Active Record (which is the easiest thing to get into a project, I have found) and then expand your Castle use later on.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There is an interesting debate in the Castle deveoper list at the moment. It is interesting because I think that all sides agree on just about all the points under discussion. :-)    Anyway, it got to the point where the subject of 3rd party controls and Mono Rail came up. Mono Rail has support for Web Forms view engine, which means that you can use all the usual ASP.Net controls (the in-the-box ones, Infragistics, Component Art, Telerik, etc). As readers of the blog already know, I am... not fond of the Web Forms idea. At best, this is a leaky abstraction.     Hammett qouted someone telling him this:&quot;try saying to a CTO that they wont be able to leverage on third party controls&quot;     Here is my (somewhat edited) reply that statement. Keep in mind that I recognize the difficulity in trying to sell something like this to a company. The ability to reuse their invesement     About a year ago I posted why I don&#x27;t like the ASP.Net Web Forms model, my option hasn&#x27;t changed drasitcally in the meantime.&#xA0;My response to the third party components issues is to direct to this post.&#xA0;And tell a tale from a far off land called the Here&amp;Now:             I am working on a project now (over a year in development alone, several teams, complex domain, complex requirements) where the downstream team has evaluated and purchased both Infragistics and Component Art. (This included a&#xA0;source license for Infragistics, and maybe Component Art as well).    They were drawn to the big benefits of being able to utilize 3rd party controls, speed up their dev time, etc.&#xA0;    Overall, I think that they spend quite a few man months trying to get those controls exactly the shape that they wanted. Eventually they abandoned most of them (there are remains here are there), and are using controls built in-house&#xA0; (mostly based on the default MS ones) to do all their presentations. The adventure with 3rd party controls cost them tens of thousands of dollars. And their codebase has four sets of controls, Component Art, Infragistics, Microsoft, Inhouse, all of them doing roughly the same thing, all of them subtly different.             Granted, in many cases, you could do quite a bit with 3rd party controls, but I find that the minute that I need to do something extra, and I always need to do something extra, it is taking me more time to get it right than it would have taken me to write it from scratch.         This is why my part of the project has 5 calendar controls, each written for a specific page (need to do a lot of coloring of the data, different colors, algorithms and data per page), instead of a super complex single calendar.             In most cases, I find that I don&#x27;t need all that extensability / features in a control, I usually need a very small subset (which you probably couldn&#x27;t sell alone, so it gets a lot of extra functionality, to fit a lot of cases). Writing that functionality by myself wouldn&#x27;t take much longer than learning a new control and figuring out how to get it to where I want.</p>
