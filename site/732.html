            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Colin Jack has brought up the question of generic entities, which is something that I consider fairly odd use case. Generics are very useful, but not in the final entity layer (they are very useful as layer super type, though). First, let us understand what I am are talking about when I am thinking about generic entities:   The generic entity that you see is ContactInformation&lt;TContactInfoType&gt;, and we want to use several specialized versions of that in our application. In this case, we have contact that can be either a string or a user. Here is an interesting tidbit, NHibernate supports this, here it the required configuration: &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;&#xA;&lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns=&quot;urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   assembly=&quot;Blog&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;   namespace=&quot;MyBlog&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;class name=&quot;ContactInformation`1[System.String]&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   table=&quot;ContactInformation_String&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/id&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;property name=&quot;Contact&quot; type=&quot;System.String&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;/class&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;class name=&quot;ContactInformation`1[MyBlog.User]&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9; table=&quot;ContactInformation_User&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot;&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/id&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;many-to-one name=&quot;Contact&quot; class=&quot;MyBlog.User, Blog&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;/class&gt;&#xA;&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;&#xA;We can even do different associations to different classes, simple column for string, FK for user. &#xA;What we can&#x27;t do is to map ContactInformation&lt;TContactInfoType&gt;, for the very simple reason that we have no way of doing it. Consider the example above, in one case, we are using a FK, in the other, a simple column. NHibernate has no way of guessing, and since I can&#x27;t really think of a good reason to want to start mapping random values to my database, I think that NHibernate is doing a good thing by insisting that you tell it about how you want this mapped.&#xA;There may be a problem with querying this with HQL, but I think this can be gotten around to with importing the class name to an alias.&#xA;Now, let us get back to the diagram below, by show of hand (well, comments), how many of you think that this is a good way to design your entities?&#xA;An entity is not a list, to which you shove random data. It has a meaning in the domain, and it has a table in which you put the data, and you want to query it, etc. It would take some pretty peculiar use case to convince me that there isn&#x27;t a really simplifying factor here by simply introducing SimpleContactInformation and UserContactInformation classes, which would simple derived from the generic class with the appropriate parameters. The ability to use generics is nice to cut duplicate code, but it also obstruct the clarity of the code, so I see this as significant added value.&#xA;In short, it is possible, but don&#x27;t do it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Names should be in ASCII and are limited to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Anything else, is a heretic attempt to cause me, personally, problems.So speaks the guy who had to convince a company that building a platform on Hebrew# is not a good idea. In addition to that, those names should be in English, consistently spelled and have a uniform coding style. I don&#x27;t care what, just that it is consistent and uniform. Nevertheless, Hungarian notation should be left to those who dreams of the coup of the pwsz and its friend, cbSize. Transcripting variables names is also a sin, and it punishable by crucifixion at your social reform site of choice.  Using names (subject to the above mentioned char limits) from latin-script based languages is allowed, assuming that the work is completely local. Sorry, but I rarely can help with code that looks like:  ILympho loco = new Alieniloquium(); If the developer speaks more than one language, though, a single language should be used across the entire code base. To do otherwise is to court disaster. Again, I can&#x27;t really understand code that goes like this:  Employee divka = Employees.GetByMispar(15); Those are the things that I have found useful.&#xA0; The above applies to types, members, variables, parameters, tables, columns and file names.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, I haven&#x27;t wrote anything about that in a while, and I am scanning the change log right now, and it looks like a lot have been going on. Fabio Maulo has been going at it with gusto, and has ported several very big features, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for that. Karl Chu has been doing some really nice things as well, and deserve thanks as well. Awesome work, both of you. Me, I am sitting in the corner with slack jaw and watching the feature pile on top of each other. This is a partial list only, mind you, I am going over the log, but it contains over three hundred commits, and I am not that patient. I also put things here that I consider significant, which may means that I am missing some things that are important to others. New &amp; Exciting features:  CriteriaTransformer - allows to clone and transform ICriteria and DetachedCriteria. Criteria inspection - improved the ability to see what it going on there, previously was write only. Multi Criteria - the companion to Multi Query &lt;join&gt; tables - allowing to compose a single&#xA0;entity from several tables. Events, Actions and Listeners - this is a very big feature, and it extends the way you can work with NHibernate in very deep ways. Think of it like the interceptor&#x2B;&#x2B;. Persistence Context - this is important for the internal NHibernate structure, it makes it much close to the Hibernate one, which in turn make it easier to share features. list-index - adding the ability to specify the base index of a list, instead of always going from 0 property-ref - allow to have an association that is not based on the primary key on an entity Stateless Session - easier way to work with bulk data, without needing the first level cache Cache Mode - better control on how the session will work with the second level cache. Statistics feature - useful for tests, and to see exactly what NHibernate is doing. Query plan - NHibernate will parse named queries&#xA0;in advance, which allows to do nice things, like provide tool support for them, beyond the perf implications Update IInterceptor - now supports H3.2 methods and capabilities &lt;union-subclass&gt; - like &lt;join-subclass&gt;, but with union instead of joins Other changes:  Bug fixes Using more .Net 2.0 features, generic collections throughout, etc. CLS Compliant refactoring Changing the internal processing of the XML processing to use a more easy to use serialized classes Single consistent configuration schema, for both app.config and hibernate.cfg.xml Updated NHibernate&#x27;s proxies to use Castle&#x27;s RC3 Again, this is partial list only, and I am covering the last 4 months only, but I am very pleased with what we have even so far...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Scott Bellware is talking about Gloryhounds:   Gloryhounds are often already visible members of the community.&#xA0; Upon achieving a certain level of authority in their particular specialization, and a sufficient level of visibility, they rally to an impending new technology release, and work with the benefactor to bring a semblance of impartial evangelism to the community while the benefactor provides the Gloryhound with opportunities that bolster his status through promotional engagements supporting the new technology. Scott has a decidedly... un-commercial streak, which I can both appreciate and disagree with. I appreciate it because I have been flat out lied to by people that had commercial interest in technological decisions, and I disagree because I don&#x27;t think in advance that anything commercial is suspect by default. Ben Scheirman&#xA0;then asks:  Is it wrong that I&#x27;m excited about ASP.NET MVC? &#xA0;Should people not listen to me &quot;preach&quot; it because I didn&#x27;t invent Rails, MonoRail, Django &amp; others? No, it is not, period. However, getting excited about it without ever going out and learning about the rest is a bad idea in many ways. Deciding that this is the true path, so decreed by [vendor] is almost always a bad decision. Making the decision that this product or approach is the best out there because you have tried a significant portion of them is almost always a good decision. Some people thinks that NHibernate is problematic, because it doesn&#x27;t comes with VS integration and drag &amp; drop. I disagree, and I see a lot more value in the flexibility that I get from the approach that NH has chosen.&#xA0;That means that if you want to argue OR/M with me you should have experience in building applications that relies on OR/Ms.&#xA0; If one would want to argue, &quot;I just saw an EF demo, and the designer is great, so it is the best thing out there&quot; I am going to label that guy as uninformed. No, demo applications are not good enough. You need a real project or two to get things rolling, you need to bang your head against a technology. You need to code in anger and swear eternal vengeance against&#xA0;the authors&#x27; ancestors&#xA0;&#xA0;nine generations backs and three forward.  In other words, if your use of the tool has never cracked it around the edges, you haven&#x27;t done enough to really tell how it is going to be. After you have done that, you should also look at the other tools, not to the same level, but to a degree where you are familiar with them enough to discuss their pros and cons from a knowledgeable position.  Then, I think that you are capable of being a &quot;recognized leader in the problem space&quot;, as Scott so eloquently puts it For myself, I read Java, Rails and Erlang books occasionally, just to make sure that I don&#x27;t walk with blinders on. I keep an eye on what is going on around in both the .NET land and in other frameworks and platforms. This is also not something that I believe that you can just sit still and let past&#xA0;results indicate future performance.  And, I think, the key point to take from Scott&#x27;s post and Ben&#x27;s question is that there is a distinct difference between saying: &quot;oh look, it can do back flips while singing the top 50, cool!&quot; vs. &quot;as a recognized leader...&quot;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Just saw my application startup shoot through the roof. It got from the merely annoying to the absolutely ridicilous. At first I cast blame around, but after a while I tried the first method of investigating, which was to attach to the process and hit pause, then inspect what it is currently doing. The stack trace pointed out to the ConfigureAndWatch method on XmlConfigurator, which was stuck on SqlConnection.Open, which lead me to figure out that my connection string was pointing at the wrong place, which led to a slow startup...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned before that we built most of the batch processes without ever considerring how we would actually run them. We put a tiny bit of thought into what we would need, and built declerative attributes that specified what we wanted. We also expressed that in terms that are not tied to a particular scheduling platform, but in terms that made sense to us. For instance, we have tasks that are scheduled for &quot;Morning&quot;, and that specifies that they should not run in holidays. Since it became clear that we now really need to suppose some way of scheduling those for real (you know, we are going to production, and I understand that admins are getting pissed if they have to run debuggers in 2:32AM sharp in order to get things to work). So, I looked at four options:  Castle.Components.Scheduling Quartz.NET Rhino Scheduling Task Manager Both Castle.Component.Scheduling and Quartz.NET are very rich scheduling platform, with a lot of options and hooks and some really nice code under the seams. Quartz.NET seems to be the more mature, and it has a lot more options. If I wanted to build a system where scheduled tasks and batch processes were the main thing, I would likely take one of those, and most probably Quartz.NET.  The problem with both of them is that they have no easy way for an administrator to manage those, and while it is probably very easy to built, that is not what I consider a good investement of my time. At least not in comparision to the several dozens tasks that I have to manage. Rhino Scheduling has the sever problem of not existing, and while I built task scheduling application in the past, just looking at what the previous two have done was enough to make me feel inadeque. I was certainly not going to go off and implement a misfire feature, that was for sure. That left Task Scheduler. I had dealt with it only manually in the past, so I was very skeptic. It is COM based thingie, and I don&#x27;t like COM based thingies. They like to throw HRESULT around and puke INVALID_WRPC errors all over the place. Nevertheless, it looked like my manager has already had a managed library to deal with it, and using that, it was extremely easy to start exploring what Task Scheduler had to offer. I have to say, I came away impressed. It has a very rich set of scheduling semantics. Not nearly as full featured as the first two on the list, but fairly comprehensive. Certainly enough for my needs. I particularily liked te OnIdle and the MonthlyDOW (although I am pissed about not being able to schedule to the first and last Sundays of March on the same trigger). The major advantage is that we can rely on the existing infrastructure, and the admin should probably know it and be able to deal with it easily. For my part, I don&#x27;t touch the UI, it is API very similar to Quartz.NET, you register a task and a trigger, and set it loose. The major difference is that Task Scheduler does it by shelling out a new process, while most of the others use a command pattern to do it in process. For my purposes, creating a new process is just fine, and the builtin UI is a significant benefit.</p>
