            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So far in this series of posts I looked into how we write posts. The media goes to S3 compatible API and the posts themselves will go to&#xA0; a key/value store. Reading them back, on the other hand, isn&#x2019;t that simple. For the media, I&#x201D;m going to assume that the S3 is connected to CDN and that is handled, but I want to focus on the manner in which we deal with reading posts. In particular, I&#x2019;m not talking here about how we can display the timeline for a user. That is going to be the subject on another post, right now, I&#x2019;m assuming that this is handled and talking about the next step. We have a list of post ids that we want to get and we need to manage that.&#xA;The endpoint in question would look like this:&#xA;&#xA;GET /api/v1/read?post=1352410889870336005&amp;post=1351081958063951875&#xA;&#xA;The result of this API is a JSON object with the keys as the posts ids and the values as the content of the post.&#xA;This simple API is about as simple as you can imagine, but even from this simple scenario you can see a few interesting details:&#xA;&#xA;The API is using GET, which means that there is a natural limit to the size of the URL. This is good and by design. We will likely limit this to a maximum of 128 items as a time anyway.&#xA;The API is inherently about dealing with batches of information.&#xA;The media is handled separately (generated directly from the client) so we can return far less information.&#xA;&#xA;In many cases, this is going to be a unique set of posts, for example, when you view your timeline, it is likely that you&#x2019;ll see a unique set of posts. However, in many other cases, you&#x2019;ll send a request that is similar or identical to what others will use.&#xA;When you are looking at a popular thread, for example, you&#x2019;ll be asking the same posts ids as everyone else, which means that there is a good chance to easily add caching for this via CDN or the like and benefit greatly as a result.&#xA;Internally, the implementation of this API is probably just going to issue direct reads by ids to the key/value store and just return the result. There should be a minimal amount of processing involved, usually, except for one factor, authorization.&#xA;Assuming that the key/value interface has a get(id) method, the backend code for this API critical API should be something like the code below. Note that this is&#xA0;server side code, I&#x27;m not showing any client side code in this series of posts. This is the backend code to handle address the reading of a batch of ids from the client.&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

That isn&#x2019;t always the case, but I&#x2019;ll assume that. We issue N async promises to the key/value and wait to get them all back. This assumes that the latency from the API node to the key/value servers is minimal and let us batch a lot of remote calls into near calls.&#xA;The vast majority of the function is dedicated to the auth behavior. A post can be marked as public or protected, and if it is the later, we need to ensure that only people that the author of the post follow will be able to see this. You&#x2019;ll note that I&#x2019;m doing a lot of stuff in an async manner here. For example, we&#x2019;ll only issue a single check per post author and we can safely assume that most posts are public anyway. I&#x2019;m including the &#x201C;full&#x201D; code here to give you an indication about the level of complexity that I would expect to see in the API.&#xA;You should also note that we indicate whatever we allow to cache the results or not. In the case of a request that include a protected post, we don&#x2019;t allow it. But for the most part, we can expect to see high percentage of posts that would be only public and can benefit from that.&#xA;Because we are running in a distributed system, we also have to take into account all sort of interesting race conditions. For example, you may be trying to read a post that has been removed. We explicitly clear all such null items from the results. Another way to handle that is to replace the content of the post and set a marker flag, but we&#x2019;ll touch that on another post.&#xA;Finally, the code above doesn&#x2019;t handle caching or distribution. That is going to be handled both above and below this code. I&#x2019;ll have a dedicated post around that tomorrow.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This design deal with creating what is effectively a Twitter clone, seeing how we can do that efficiently. A really nice feature of Twitter is that it has just one type of interaction a tweet. The actual tweet may be a share, a reply, a mention or any number of other things, but those are properties on the post, not a different model entirely. Contrast that with Facebook, on the other hand, where you have Posts and Replies as very distinct items. As it turns out, that can be utilized quite effectively to build the core foundation of the system with great efficiency. There are two separate sides for a social network, the write and read portions. And the read side is massively bigger than the write side. Twitter currently has about 6,000 tweets a second, for example, but it has 186 million daily users. We are going to base the architecture on a few assumptions:We are going to favor reads over writes.Reads&#x2019; speed should be a priority at all times.It is fine to take some (finite, small) amount of time to show a post to followers.Favor the users&#x2019; experience over actual guarantees. What this means is that when we write a new post, the process is going to be roughly so:Post the new message to a queue and send confirmation to the client.Add the new post to the user&#x2019;s timeline on the client side directly. Done.Really important detail here. The process of placing an item on the queue is simple, trivial to scale on an infinite basis and can easily handle huge spikes in load.On the other hand, the fact that the client&#x2019;s code will show the user that the message in their timeline is usually sufficient for good user experience. There is the need to process that and send it to followers ASAP, but that is as soon as possible in people&#x2019;s terms. In other words, if it takes 30 seconds or two minutes, it isn&#x2019;t a big deal.With just those details, we are pretty much done with the write side. We accepted the post, we pretend to the user that we are done processing it, but that is roughly about it. All the rest of the work that we need to do now is to see how we can most easily generate the read portion of things.There are some other considerations to take into account. We need to deal not just with text but also images and videos. A pretty core part of the infrastructure is going to be an object storage with S3 compatible API. The S3 API has became an industry standard and is pretty widely supported. That help us reduce the dependency issue. If needed, we can MinIO, run on Backblaze, etc.When a user send a new post, any media elements of the post are stored directly in the S3 storage and then the post itself is written to a queue. Workers will fetch items from the queue and process them. Such processing may entail things like:Stripping EXIF data from images.Re-encoding videos.Analyzing content for language / issues. For example, we never want to have posts about Broccoli, so we can remove / reject them at this stage. This is where a lot of the business logic will reside, mind. During the write portion, we have time. This is an asynchronous process that we can afford to take some time. Scaling workers to read from a queue is cheap, simple an easy technique, after all. That means that we can afford to shift most of the work required to this part of the process.For example, maybe a user posted a reply to a message that only allow replies from users mentioned on the post? That sort of thing.Once processed, we end up with the following architecture:The keys for each post are numeric (this will be important later). We can generate them using the Snowflake method:In other words, we use 40 bits with 16 millisecond precision for the time, 10 bits (1,024) as the machine id and 14 bits (16,384) as the sequence number. The 16 ms precision is already the granularity that you can expect from most computer clocks, so we aren&#x2019;t actually losing much by giving it up. It does means that we don&#x2019;t really have to think about it. A single instance can generate 16K ids each 16 ms, or about a million ids per second. More than enough for our needs.The key about those ids is that they are going to be roughly sorted. That will be very nice to use later on.&#xA0; When accepting a post, we&#x2019;ll generate an id for that, and then place that in the key/value store using that id. All other work from that point of is about working with those ids, but we&#x2019;ll discuss that with more details when we talk about timelines.For now, I think that this post gives a good (and intentionally partial) view of how I expect to handle a new write:Upload any media to S3 compatible API.Generate a new ID for the post.Run whatever processing you need for the post and the media.Write the post to the key/value store under the relevant id. This include also the appropriate references for the parent post, any associated media, etc.Publish to the appropriate timelines. (I&#x2019;ll discuss this in a future post)I&#x2019;m using the term key/value store here generically, because we&#x2019;ll do a lookup per id and find the relevant JSON for the post. Such systems can scale pretty much linearly with very little work. Given the fact that we use roughly time based ids and the time base nature of most social interactions, we can usually move most posts to archive mode in a very natural way. But that would be a separate optimization step that I don&#x2019;t think that would actually be relevant at this point. It is good to have such options, though.And that is pretty much it for writes. There are probably pieces here that I&#x2019;m missing, but I expect that they are related to the business processing that you&#x2019;ll want to do on the posts, not the actual infrastructure. On my next post, I&#x2019;ll deal with the other side. How do we actually read a post? Given the difference in scale, I think that this is a much more interesting scenario.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Following the discussion a few days ago, I thought that I would share my high level architecture for building a social media platform in a way that would make sense. In other words, building software that is performant, efficient and not waste multiples of your yearly budget on unnecessary hardware.&#xA;It turns out that 12 years ago, I wrote a post that discusses how I would re-architect twitter. At the time, the Fail Whale would make repeated appearances several times a week and Twitter couldn&#x2019;t really handle its load. I think that a lot of the things that I wrote then are still applicable and would probably allow you to scale your system without breaking the bank. That said, I would like to think that I learned a lot since that time, so it is worth re-visiting the topic.&#xA;Let&#x2019;s outline the scenario, in terms of features, we are talking about basically cloning the key parts of Twitter. Core features include:&#xA;&#xA;Tweets&#xA;Replies&#xA;Mentions&#xA;Tags&#xA;&#xA;Such an application does quite a lot a the frontend, which I&#x2019;m not going to touch. I&#x2019;m focusing solely on the backend processing here. There are also a lot of other things that we&#x2019;ll likely need to deal with (metrics, analytics, etc), which are separate and not that interesting. They can be handled via existing analytics platforms and don&#x2019;t require specialized behavior.&#xA;One of the best parts of a social media platform is that by its very nature, it is eventually consistent. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if I post a tweet and you see it now or in 5 seconds. That gives us a huge amount of flexibility in how we can implement this system efficiently.&#xA;Let&#x2019;s talk about numbers I can easily find:&#xA;&#xA;Twitter has 340 million users.&#xA;Twitter has 42% of the population active.&#xA;Twitter has 6,000 / second. &#x2013; 15.7 billion tweets a month.&#xA;80% of the content is generated by 10% of the users.&#xA;In Twitter, out of 1.3 billion accounts, only 550 million ever sent a tweet.&#xA;A very small percentage have large followers counts. The latest numbers I can get are from early the previous decade, then Twitter has 0.06% of accounts with more than 20,000 followers. and 2.12% has more than 1,000 followers.&#xA;Common twitter usage is 2 tweets a month (common) to 138 a month (prolific).&#xA;&#xA;There are problem with those stats, however. A lot of them are old, some of them are very old, nearly a decade!&#xA;Given that I&#x2019;m writing this blog to myself (and you, my dear reader), I&#x2019;m going to make some assumptions so we can move forward:&#xA;&#xA;50 million users, but we&#x2019;ll assume that they are more engaged than the usual group.&#xA;Out of which 50% (25,000,000) would post on a given month.&#xA;80% of the users post &lt; 5 posts a month. That means 20 million users that post very rarely.&#xA;20% of the users 5 million or so, post more frequently, with a maximum of around 300 posts a month.&#xA;1% of the active users 50,000) posts even more frequently, to the tune of a couple of hundred posts a day.&#xA;&#xA;Checking my math, that means that:&#xA;&#xA;50,000 high active users with 150 posts a day for a total of 225 million posts.&#xA;5 million active users with 300 posts a month for another 1.5 billion posts.&#xA;20 million other users with 5 posts a month, given us another 100 million posts.&#xA;&#xA;Total month posts in this case, would be:&#xA;&#xA;1.745 billion posts a month.&#xA;2.4 million posts an hour.&#xA;670 posts a second.&#xA;&#xA;That assume that there is&#xA0; a constant load on the system, which is probably not correct. For example, the 2016 Super Bowl saw a record of 152,000 tweets per minute with close to 17 million tweets posted during the duration of the game.&#xA;What this means is that the load is highly variable.&#xA0; We may have low hundreds of posts per second to thousands. Note that 152,000 posts per minute are &#x201C;just&#x201D; 2,533 posts per second, which is a lot less scary, even if it means the same.&#xA;We&#x2019;ll start by stating that we want to process 2,500 posts per second as the current maximum acceptable target.&#xA;One very important factor that we have to understand is what exactly do we mean by &#x201C;processing&#x201D; a post. That means recording the act of the post and doing that within an acceptable time frame, we&#x2019;ll call that 200 ms latency for the 99.99%.&#xA;I&#x2019;m going to focus on text only mode, because for binaries (pictures and movies) the solution is to throw the data on a CDN and link to it, nothing more really needs to be done. Most CDNs will already handle things like re-encoding, formatting, etc, so that isn&#x2019;t something that you need to worry about to start with.&#xA;Now that I have laid the ground works, we can start thinking about how we can actually process this. That is going to be handled in a few separate pieces. First, how do we accept the post and process it and then how do we distribute it to all the followers. I&#x2019;ll start dissecting those issues in my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into the following twitter, which list some of Parler&#x2019;s requirements (using the upper limits specified):&#xA;&#xA;Scylla cluster &#x2013; 40 nodes with 64 cores, 512GB RAM, 14TB NVME drives for each node. For a total of 2,560 cores and 20TB RAM, 560 TB of disks.&#xA;PostgreSQL cluster &#x2013; 100 nodes with 96 cores, 768 GB RAM and 4 TB NVME. For a total of 9,600 cores, 75 TB RAM and 400 TB of disks.&#xA;400 application instances &#x2013; 16 cores &amp; 64 GB RAM.&#xA;&#xA;Their internal traffic is about 6.6 GB / sec and their external traffic is about 2 GB / sec. There is a lot of interesting discussion on the twitter feed on these numbers, but I thought that it would be interesting to see how much it would cost to build that.&#xA;The 64 Cores &amp; 512 GB RAM can be handled via Gigabyte R282-Z90, the given specs says that a single one would cost 27,000 USD. That means that the Scylla cluster alone would be about a million dollar, but I haven&#x2019;t even touched on the drives. I couldn&#x2019;t find a 14 TB NVMe drive in a cursory search, but a 15.36TB drive (Micron 9300 Pro 15.36TB NVMe) costs 2,500 USD per unit. That makes the cost of the hardware alone for the Scylla cluster at 1.15 million USD.&#xA;I would expect about twice that much for the PostgreSQL cluster, for what it&#x2019;s worth. For the application servers, that is a lot less, with about a 4,000 USD cost per instance. That comes to another 1.6 million USD.&#xA;Total cost is roughly 5 million USD, and we aren&#x2019;t talking about the other stuff (power, network, racks, etc). I&#x2019;m not a hardware guy, mind! I&#x2019;m probably missing a lot of stuff. At that size, you can likely get volume discounts, but I&#x2019;m missing that the stuff that I&#x2019;m missing would cost quite a lot as well. Call it a minimum of 7.5 million USD to setup a data center with those numbers. That does not include labor and licensing costs, I want to add.&#xA;Also, note that that kind of capacity is likely something that you can&#x2019;t just get from anyone but the big cloud providers with a quick turnaround basis. I&#x2019;ll estimate that this is a multiple months just to order the parts, to be honest.&#xA;In other words, they are going to be looking at a major financial commitment and some significant lead time.&#xA;Then again&#x2026; Given their location in Henderson, Nevada, the average developer salary is 77,000 USD per year. That means that the personal cost, which is typically significantly higher than any other expense, is actually not that big. As of Non 2020, they had about 30 people working for Parler, assuming all of them are developers paid 100,000 USD a year (significantly higher than the average salary in their location), the employment costs of the entire company would likely be under half of the cost of the hardware required.&#xA;All of that said&#x2026;. what we can really see here is a display of incompetency. At the time it was closed, Parler has roughly 15 &#x2013; 20 million users. A lot of them were recently registrations, of course, but Parler already experience several cases of high number of user registrations in the past. In June of 2020 it saw 500,000 users registering to its services within 3 days, for example.&#xA;Let&#x2019;s take the 20 million users as the number of users, and assume that all of them are in the states and have the same hours of activity. We&#x2019;ll further assume that we have high participation numbers and all of those users are actively viewing. Remember the 1% rule, only a small minority of users are actually generating content on most platforms. The vast majority are silent observers. That would give us roughly 200,000 users that generate content, but even then, not all content is made equal. We have posts and comments, basically, and treating them differently is a basic part of building efficient system.&#xA;On Twitter, Katy Perry has just under 110 million followers. Let&#x2019;s assume that the Parler ecosystem was highly interconnected and most of the high profile accounts would be followed by the majority of the users. That means that the top 20,000 users will be followed by all the other 20 millions. The rest of the 180,000 users that active post will likely do so in reaction, not independently, and have comparatively smaller audiences.&#xA;Now, we need to estimate how much these people will post. I looked at Dave Weigel&#x2019;s account (591.7K followers), covering politics for Washington Post. I&#x2019;m writing this on Jan 20, so the Biden inauguration takes place. I&#x2019;m assuming that this is a busy time for political correspondents.&#xA0; Looking at his twitter feed, he posted 3,220 tweets this month and Jan 6, which had a lot to report on, had 377 total tweets. Let&#x2019;s take 500 as the reasonable upper bound for the number of interactions of most of the top users in the system, shall we?&#xA;That means that we have:&#xA;&#xA;20,000 high profiler users.&#xA;Each posting to a max of 500 a day.&#xA;Let&#x2019;s assume that this all happens in 8 hours, instead of over the entire day.&#xA;That translates to roughly 1,250,000 posts an hour. If we express this in terms of posts per second, that comes to 348 posts per second.&#xA;&#xA;Go and look at the specs above. Using these metrics, you can dedicate a machine for each one of those posts. Given the number of cores requested for application instances (400 x 16 = 6400 cores), this is beyond ridiculous.&#xA;Just to give you some context, when we run benchmarks of RavenDB, we run it on a Raspberry Pi 3. That is a 25$ machine, with a shady power supply and heating issues. We were able to reach over 1,000 writes / second on a sustained basis. Now, that is for simple writes, sure, but again, that is a Raspberry Pi doing three times as much as we would need to handle Parler&#x2019;s expected load (which I think I was overestimating).&#xA;This post is getting a bit long, but I want to point out another social network Stack Exchange (Stack Overflow), with 1.3 billion page views per month (assuming perfect distribution, roughly 485 page views per second, each generating multiple requests).&#xA;&#xA;Their web servers handle 450 req/sec at peak across 9 web servers (Max of 4,050 req/sec) with peak CPU usage of 12%.&#xA;2 SQL Server clusters with 4 machines in total. Handling an aggregate of 23800 queries / sec with peak CPU usage of 15%.&#xA;Render time across the board of &lt; 20 ms.&#xA;&#xA;The hardware that is used for those servers:&#xA;&#xA;9 Web - 48 cores &#x2B; 64 GB RAM&#xA;4 DB &#x2013; 32 cores &#x2B; 768 GB RAM&#xA;&#xA;There are a few other type of servers there, and I recommend looking into the links, because there is a lot of interesting details there.&#xA;The key here is that they are running top 200 site in significantly less hardware, and are able to serve requests and provide great quality of service.&#xA;To be fair, Stack Overflow is a read heavy site, with under half a million questions and answers in a month. In other words, less than 0.04% of the views generate a write. That said, I&#x2019;m not certain that the numbers would be meaningfully different in other social media platforms.&#xA;In my next post, I&#x2019;m going to explore how you can build a social media platform without going bankrupt.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am really proud with the level of transparency and visibility that RavenDB gives out of the box to its users. The server dashboard gives you all the critical information about what a node is doing and can serve as a great mechanism to tell at a glance what is the health of a node.A repeated customer request is to take that up a notch. Not just showing a single server status, but showing the entire cluster state. This isn&#x2019;t a replacement for a full monitoring solution, but it is meant to provide you with a quick overview of exactly what is going on in your cluster.I want to present some early prototypes of how we are thinking about showing this information, and I wanted to get your feedback about those, as well as any other information that you think should be relevant for the cluster dashboard.Here is the resource utilization portion of the dashboard. We aren&#x2019;t settled yet on the graphs, but we&#x2019;ll likely have CPU usage and memory (including memory breakdowns). Some of this information may be hidden by default, and you can expand it:You can get more details about what the cluster is doing here:And finally, the overall view of task assignment in the cluster:You can also drill down to a particular server status:This is early stages yet, we pretty much have just the mockup, so this is the right time to ask for what you want to see there.</p>
