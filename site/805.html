            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I did some major modifications to the project two days ago, moving properties around, adding / removing them. It was based on additional input about the model that we just got. It also meant that I had broke just about everything in the application, from the injection support to the CRUD functionality.    We have tests (not nearly enough, in my opinion, but we are working on it), but they are mostly building the UI right now, so there is a lot of focus there at the moment. We started testing with Selenium, and later moved to WatiN, this means that a lot of the stuff that I had to do with Selenium (manual waits, for instance) are not applicable. We are using a lot of ajax stuff, which meant that scattered throught the tests there were plenty of Sleep() calls, to wait for the action to complete. This caused the tests to be really slow when running the whole bunch.     I spent most of the day fixing the application and refactoring the tests. I got to go home with all the tests running green, but it had taken a long time to do it. Next week I could start new development knowing that I have a solid foundation, but I still left work feeling that I didn&#x27;t do anything meaningful to the project for the last couple of days.    I did a lot of work with the data, and we are now much closer to the real domain than we were before, but it is not something that I could feel. Just to get back own good side, I implemented this:            [InjectEntity(Key=&quot;PolicyId&quot;)]        public&#xA0;Policy&#xA0;&#xA0;Policy&#xA0;{&#xA0;get&#xA0;{&#xA0;...&#xA0;}&#xA0;set&#xA0;{&#xA0;...&#xA0;}&#xA0;}        So I would get at least some magic back.    I did learn a lof of good stuff, and our WatiN tests are now much better (and running faster). I should point out that testing Ajax actions is basically testing multi threaded code, and that is hard. I&#x27;ll post shortly about the current tests, I think that I got it to a good state, but damn, it was long.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">But feel free to start using it now. Adi&#x27;s post&#xA0;is bringing back memories from conversion long gone:First of all, even if a new technology from MS is not &quot;decent&quot; at first, you can be sure they&#x27;ll keep bringing out new versions till it is, because that&#x27;s what MS does best.    I had practically this statement thrown at me about 8-10 months ago, talking about why the customer wanted to use DLinq instead of NHibernate.    Adi, my response to that is, &quot;So?&quot;     I can get a bottle of wine that will taste real good in 15 years, that doesn&#x27;t mean that I need to start drinking it now.&#xA0;Sour grapes indeed.Take C# for example. It had no killer advantage over existing languages when it came out, yet even Oren uses it today. I doubt another company could have made that happen.    Just to point out, another company did, Sun &amp; Java. As for why I am using C#, have you looked at the alternatives? Before I did C# I was a C&#x2B;&#x2B; programmer. Can you imagine the stuff that I did with templates? I jumped into C# the moment I realize that I don&#x27;t have to manage my own memory anymore. Hell, C# has one feature that is a killer. Stacktraces for exceptions. C&#x2B;&#x2B; has 0x324ABCD memory could not be &quot;read&quot;.    I am not sure why, but I never got around to doing the other stuff (Java, Python, etc)...    Oh, and what is it with the babe?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Bill is asking how he can improve the work process of his team. The worst thing in his tale (aside from 1,500 lines of code in a set accessor!) is that there isn&#x27;t somebody that is in charge for the team, at least not someone who is technical. Unless&#xA0;a person&#xA0;is&#xA0;in a position of authority (preferably well established, rather than ad-hoc one), making significant changes is difficult.    I get a lot of milage from giving the client a link to the continious integration machine. They check to see what progress we made routinely, and the most common request I hear from them is to make the CI build more stable. (The answer to that is to give me a staging machine, but that is another story).    Doing something like this can prove to the stake holders that&#xA0;it is possibl deliver something that they desire, therefor, they will back the requirements when demands are made. In this situations, hiring the boss can be an interesting approach, go look for someone that you really admire, and then convince them to come work as the team leader /architect. Other ways include bringing in a coach, or sending the team to training.     All of the above assume that&#xA0;there is some sort of backup from above. If this is not possible, then support from the team members is crucial. From Bill&#x27;s post, it doesn&#x27;t sound like the other members of the teams are interested, but this may be because it wasn&#x27;t presented in the right manner. It is very easy to give advice about people I never knew, but broadly:            Show Mort how he can be more productive using smarter tools                 Pair with Jade to get stuff done.                 Challange the Primadona to a duel at sunrise.    More seriously, since Jade is apperantly the most experiance guy in Bill&#x27;s shop, a good way to start would be to sit with him and try to work incremental improvements. &quot;For the next month, we are putting in continious integration system, month after that, we start working on our design debt, etc&quot;.&#xA0;Define&#xA0;a certain level of quality that you will not go beneath. When two developers are collaborating, it should be easier to guide Mort into the fold. To begin with, the Primadona can be ignored, but once stuff started to roll, and the Primadona breaks it, take his code out out. I have reverted changes that broke unit tests in the past, much to the angst of a developer who didn&#x27;t consider what would happen when I come in to a broken build with no idea what had happened.     Failing all of that, starting to carry a 5Kg hammer and speaking softly always worked for me.    Bill also mentions:I don&#x27;t want to stand up and spend 30 minutes giving a presentation on IoC and separation of concerns.&#xA0;    Bill, if&#xA0;you are really serious about that, get another job. To start with, you will need to educate the rest of the team about what is happening. They need to be able to go to your code and understand what is going on. If you aren&#x27;t talking at the same level, this is a problem. And you are the guy to fix it.</p>

I can definitely see this, I have suffered from this... but!        I don&#x27;t think the problem is with the tools, in any case the problem would be of the TDD community, Ruby on Rails is open source, why can&#x27;t we create asp.net on steroids?    seems like we know exactly what we want, the concept is there, the code is there, just needs to be implemented in .NET     &#xA0;One word: MonoRail</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My post about entities and services seem to have hit a nerve, because it is probably my most popular post ever. I got some really good feedback on it. This post is mostly to ask questions, not neccesarily give answers. To make the discussion a bit more focused, here are the scenarios that I am talking about, in the context of a web-based application:            Display a list of customer&#x27;s orders.            Calculate total order cost            Display all the items in an order            Create new order            Add new item to order            Print full reciept for the order    Quite a few people didn&#x27;t like the fact that the service is tightly coupled to the implementation of Order.CalculateCost().&#xA0;Stephen suggested that I would use this type of code:money = orderService.GetOrder(orderId).CalculateCost()    If that is the case, there isn&#x27;t any difference between the service and a repository. The problem that I am trying to solve is actually performance, I want to load all the OrderLines assoicated with the order so I could make calculations over them. The code above would either cause lazy load, which is inefficent, or would always load everything, which is also inefficent.    Udi&#xA0;suggested building a set of interfaces for the actions that the class can take, and assoicate fetching strategies with each action, this way we decouple the service from the details of the CalculateCost() implementation. I like the idea, but I am not sure if this isn&#x27;t too much overhead for the scenario. Decoupling the fetching strategy is good, but I think that it is more appropriate for more complex problems.    Paul&#xA0;suggest going even further with the DDD route. I am pretty sure that I don&#x27;t understand what he means, so I would like it if someone could educate me. He had this code sample:            public&#xA0;T&#xA0;FindOne(IFetchSpecification&#xA0;fSpec)        {        &#xA0;fSpec.AddSpan(&quot;OrderLines&quot;);        &#xA0;return&#xA0;(T)context.Find(fSpec);        }        Which I don&#x27;t think is appropriate, once again, I don&#x27;t always want the order lines, I want them for specific scenarios only. And I am not sure how I can get the above code to behave in both scenarios.    (Currently) the last comment on the previous post belongs to Stephen, he suggests having an abstract type Order, and two decendants: DoesntHaveOrderLines&#xA0;and CalculatedOrder (which does have them). This solve the problem of knowing when to bring the data, but I really don&#x27;t think that splitting the entities according to performance concerns is a good way to go.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeremy Millier really hit the nail on the head with this one:I really think the .Net community needs to reexamine and debate the merits and appropriateness of the Visual RAD approach.&#xA0; A lot of what makes&#xA0;ASP.Net WebForms&#xA0;hard to test is the extra complexity that&#x27;s there to support design time controls, specifically the&#xA0;page&#xA0;event cycle.&#xA0; RAD is doing more damage than good because the negative impact on maintainability/testability overwhelms the &quot;write once&quot; advantages of RAD.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A book about ANTLR&#xA0;is something that I have long lusted after. It is something that I keep planning to learn, but the learning curve is too high to do this informally. Looks like I am getting my wish, The Definitive ANTLR Reference&#xA0;is in beta book now.    ANTLR is a compiler compiler, which makes it a great tool to write languages (Boo&#x27;s parser is written in ANTLR, for instance). And although I would generally use Boo for DSL, it is important to me to understand the parser as well.</p>
