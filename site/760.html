            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">How many times have the documentation of a product told you that you really should use another product? Well, this is one such case. Rhino Igloo is an attempt to make an application that was mandated to Web Forms more palatable to work with. As such, it is heavily influenced by MonoRail and its ideas.  I speak as the creator of this framework, if at all possible, prefer (mandate!) the use of MonoRail, it will be far easier, all around. Model View Controller is a problematic subject in Web Forms, because of the importance placed on the view (ASPX page) in the Web Forms framework. When coming to build an MVC framework on top of Web Forms, we need to consider this limitation in our design. For that reason, Rhino Igloo is not a pure MVC framework, and it works under the limitations of the Web Forms framework. Along with the MVC framework, Rhino Igloo has tight integration to the Windsor IoC container, and make extensive use of it in its internal operations.  It is important to note that while we cover the main chain of events that occurs when using Rhino Igloo, we are not going into the implementation details here, just a broad usage overview.I took to liberty of flat out ignoring implementation details that are not necessary to understanding how things flow. The Views Overall, the Rhino Igloo4framework hooks into the Web Forms pipeline by utilizing a common set of base classes ( BasePage, BaseMaster, BaseScriptService, BaseHttpHandler ).&#xA0; This set of base classes provide transparent dependency injection capabilities to the views. As an example, to the right you can see the Login page. As you can see that the login page has a Controller property, of type LoginController. The controller property is a simple property, which the base page initializes with an instance of the LoginController. It is important to note that it is not the responsibility of the Login page to initialize the Controller property, but rather its parent, the BasePage. As an example, here is a valid page, which, when run, will have its Controller property set to an instance of a LoginController: public partial class Login : BasePage { &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; private LoginController controller; &#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; public LoginController Controller &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; { &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; get { return controller; } &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; set { controller = value; } &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; } &#xA0;} As a result of that, the view no longer needs to be aware of the dependencies that the LoginController itself has. Those are automatically supplied using Windsor itself. The controller is the one responsible for handling the logic of the particular use case that we need to handle. The view&#x27;s responsibilities are to call the controller when needed. Here is the full implementation of the above Login_Click method: public void Logon_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; if (!Controller.Authenticate(Username.Text, Password.Text)) &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; { &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0; lblError.Text = Scope.ErrorMessage; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; } } &#xA0; As you can see, the view calls to the controller, which can communicate back to the view using the scope.  The Scope The scope class is the main way controllers get their data, and a common way to pass results from the controller to the view. The scope class contains properties such as Input and Session, which allows an abstract access to the current request and the user&#x27;s session. This also allows replacing them when testing, so we can test the behavior of the controllers without resorting to loading the entire HTTP pipeline. Of particular interest are the following properties: &#xB7;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Scope.ErrorMessage &#xB7;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Scope.SuccessMessage &#xB7;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Scope.ErrorSummary These allow the controller to pass messages to the view, and in the last case, the entire validation failure package, as a whole. Communication between the controller and the view is intentionally limited, in order to ensure separation of concerns between the two. The controllers All controllers inherit from Base Controller, which serves as a common base class and a container for a set of utility methods as well. From the controller, we can access the current context, which is a nicer wrapper around the Http Context and operations exposed by it. While the controllers are POCO classes, which are easily instantiated and used outside the HTTP context, there are a few extra niceties that are supplied for the controllers. The first is the Initalize() method, which allows the controller to initialize itself before processing begins.  As an extension to this idea, and taking from MonoRail DataBind approach, there are other niceties:  [Inject] Inject is an attribute that can be used to decorate a property, at which point the Rhino Igloo framework will take a value from the request, convert it to the appropriate data type and set the property when the controller is first being created. Here is an example: [Inject] public virtual Guid CurrentGuid { &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Get { return currentGuid;&#xA0; } &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; set { currentGuid = value; } } The framework will search for a request parameter with the key &quot;CurrentGuid&quot;, convert the string value to a Guid, and set its value. [InjectEntity] InjectEntity performs the same operation as Inject does, but it takes the value and queries the database an entity with the specified key. [InjectEntity(Name = Constants.Id, EagerLoad = &quot;Customer&quot;)] public Order Order { &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; get { return order; } &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; set { order = value; } } This example shows how we can automatically load an order from the database based on the &quot;Id&quot; request parameter, and eager load the Customer property as well. The model Rhino Igloo has integration to Rhino Common&#x27;s Unit Of Work style, but overall, has no constraints on the way the model is built.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Udi has a post with a provocative title&#xA0;about estimation. I agree completely. Except:  Focusing on the individual developer, getting them the latest and greatest tools may be great for their morale, but it probably won&#x2019;t make a bit of difference to their actual productivity. That is not something that I would agree to. Latest&#xA0;&amp; greatest tools are not something that I am particularly interested in, but having effective tools means a world of difference in my productivity. I could mention ReSharper, but that is practically cheating, since I refuse to do any amount of real work without it. Effective tools are ones that cut down the time that I need to do something, they may be as old as GREP, or as new as the feature that I just put into NHibernate, or a methodology that depends on foot driven mouse to streamline the development experience. I don&#x27;t care what they are, they just have to be effective in making it easier to build software. Not to churn out code faster, that is meaningless, but to build software in more effective ways.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeremy Miller is talking about agile adoption, and he raised the issue of fixed bids in agile projects. Fixed money, fixed time, fixed scope projects are the ones that are easiest for the bean counters to work with. You pay X$ you wait Y months, you get Z features. If the other side fails to hold their end of the bargain, you start reducing X$. Easiest for bean counters doesn&#x27;t mean that it is easiest for the software project itself. The problem is that not RFP that I have seen is close to detailing all that the customer wants, and the behind the scene political struggles to get more &amp; more on the RFP by other departments (hi, it comes out of the ZYX department budget, it us get our critical feature U there) can produce direct contradiction in the underlying requirements. Here are a couple recollections from some recent projects:  In one memorable occasion, I was working on a project for 6 months before the customer discovered that there was a critical failure in the spec and that we need to do some heavy duty stuff modifications for all the entities in the system. (Where heavy duty means that code couldn&#x27;t compile for days on end, when we basically restructured the core entity model for the new requirements). In a more recent project, not only no one could explain a requirement, but no one could ever recall who requested this feature, and why. To summarize, the fixed time, scope &amp; money projects aren&#x27;t really working. A favorite question by agile speaker is &quot;who have been on a project whose requirements has not changed?&quot;. I was, but it was a two days one :-) So, since change is a given, how can you approach such a project, if you want to work in an agile fashion. As Udi points out, there is a tendency in the industry to bid at cost or at a loss, and generate revenue by change requests. Leaving aside the issue of the morality of this behavior, that behavior is also leading to another of the common questions by agile speakers: &quot;how many of you delivered a system according to what the customer asked, but not what he wanted?&quot; Since the customers has already got that this was the Operation Method de-jour, that has gotten problematic. The RFP is as broad as possible, and the spec is as narrow as possible, and the spec is not something that is meant to provide a guide for the developers, but rather a tool that is meant to be used when arguing whatever a particular request is within the project scope or not. So far, this has nothing to do with Agile or no Agile. The entire premise of waterfall methodology is capturing requirement in concrete so they wouldn&#x27;t change, except that never works. Now, I am purposefully avoiding this part of the business, so take this with a ton of salt. There are several options that can be used, where the best is complete acceptance of agile from the customer, so they pay you per iteration. A more reasonable alternative is to work at the fixed money / time frame, which is far easier for the customer to arrange in the corporate environment, but be flexible on the delivered features. This tend to push unnecessary features to the end of the project, where they are already seen as unnecessary. But, the question goes, how do you win such a project? Well, you need to estimate the work from the RFP as you would usually do, and submit a proposal based on that estimate. It is likely that you will have a higher proposal than the low-balling guys, and if the only thing on the table was money, that would be a problem. The key as far as I see it is to find, not the bean counter that is signing the check, and usually couldn&#x27;t care less about the project itself, but the real customer, the one that wants the actual work done. If you can get there, you can explain why your proposal is higher (quality, no back stabbing), why you would end up with a better result (early deliverables, immediate feedback, etc) and how it directly benefits the customer to go with this approach. Some people would rather not take a risk, which is sad, but understandable, but those who would want to get things done can usually get the point across. Then you do things as usual, letting the customer dictate what will get implemented and when. At the end of the project, it is the customer that decided what would be there or not, so not only are they in a better position to understand what is going on, they are directly responsible for that. From my experience, they usually get &quot;change request&quot; (features not on the RFP) for &quot;free&quot; (trading with unnecessary features, basically, and within reason, of course)&#xA0;during this time, since they get to decide what we will work upon. The bas part is that sometimes political issues can force you to do stupid things (implement something you know no one will use), but hey, that is what the customer wants. Assuming that in the end of a project, someone find a missing feature and demands it, the customer can explain why this feature was cut, and what the client got as a result of this. I find this much better than trying to explain to a client why authenticating against their mainframe is not a good idea, and authenticating against active directory is probably a better approach. The counter argument is what happen if you customer has a party on change request all the way to the end of the project, at which point they turn around and demands everything that they ignored so far. That is the point when you politely points out to the responsible party, and let it go. Producing a bill for those change requests is also an effective measure to stop that kind of an approach. But frankly, most people wouldn&#x27;t behave like that, and it is fairly clear what type of person you are dealing with fairly early in the project. Then you plan accordingly. Frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t want to work for a dishonest customer. We used this approach in my last project, to great success. This also has to do with a really good customer (I really want more of those), but the basic principle is sound. And we are going to use it more in future projects.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Alex is talking about Data Layer Componentization, as it works in Base4 and apparently in the Entity Framework as well.   A data-layer component simply allows for information to be shared between different applications.  By supporting re-use data layer componentization allows you to break the duplication habit. You can still have silos, but the natural tendency to duplicate data disappears. Each new silo will instead contain only new types of data and where old types are required, simply pointers, or cross silo foreign keys. We have two different things here, a shared schema and a shared database. As far as I understand the idea, Alex is talking about having the ability to access the shared database in the same way, from all the applications in the organization, and not having the same schema in all the DBs for all applications, I envision is as something like this:   Taking this approach to its logical conclusion, I may end up with an application that is dependant on many databases. There are known issues with this approach, from the top of my head:  Reliability issues - the application talks to more than a single DB, so now any of the DBs going down will break it.  Maintainability issue #1 - since you have other application dependant on your database, how are you going to handle upgrades and changes to it? When you take down a single database / application, you need to take down a significant number of applications with it. Maintainability issue #2 - changing a single database can have a ripple affect to all the applications in an organization. Maintainability issue #3 - the way the previous application stored its data may cause severe issues for you when you try to consume it. Perhaps you access pattern dictate that you need to get data from several disparate tables, making it more expensive to get the data. Maybe the data that you want requires extra calculation that you want to store in the DB, etc. Maintainability issue #4 - In any big organization, it is very likely that you will have several database products in place (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc). Those have different behaviors at time, and would require that you would remember to treat them differently. Duplication issues - Quite often, the data in the database is not readily consumable, and requires a bit a business logic to handle properly. For instance, the policy status that the user sees may depend on the policy type and the risk level of the customer. If you want to do the same on another application, you need to duplicate this logic again. This can be a real issue if this is a piece of business logic that often changes. Security implications - leaving aside the problem of letting multiply applications to access a database, there are security implications that are beyond what can be specified using SQL permissions. The salary of an employee is only visible to the HR person responsible for the employee and its manager (if&#xA0;he is above level 16). Now, please try to define that using SQL Permissions. You can&#x27;t, at least not without a lot of awkwardness. This means that you need application level security decisions. To say that those are complex is a big understatement. FK issue - traditionally, cross DB FK are a problem, especially when you consider cross server and cross database products FKs. My current projects pulls data from five different databases into its own database, and several other sources like XML files, flat text files, etc. It all goes to a single database, where it is stored in a way that make it really easy for the application to consume it, and a lot of the difficult stuff has been moved to the ETL process, which make it much easier to ignore the way we get the data when I consume it. My personal preference is to create a silo, define a known master for the data that I want, and simply use an ETL process in order to get fresh data at regular intervals. This makes things a lot simpler from all perspectives. All of that said, I still don&#x27;t think that I understand why Alex thinks that other OR/M doesn&#x27;t support it. I have used the componentization technique in the past, it looks something like this:   It takes a bit of configuration to handle, but basically when you are asking to get a type from the common entities, it goes to one DB, and when you want to get your own type, it goes to the application DB. A nice property of NHibernate&#x27;s parameterized user types means that you can have cross database reference with ease. Meaning that you can have policy.Customer rather than have policy.CustomerId. A fairly big issue here is performance, since cross database joins are rarely possible (linked servers are one way, but they are a PITA and comes with their own set of problem), so you would need to be aware of that, but this is just a side effect of the approach used.  Am I missing something here?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had plans for this weekend. I really did. But it is not 05:35AM and for the second day in a row, I am watching dawn raise and feeling very annoyed at myself. Yesterday I started to listen to the March Upcountry&#xA0;audio book. Just to give you an impression, it is a 17 hours audio book, and I have just now finished it. Yes, this does mean that I spent most of the last to days listening to it. Luckily I am able to do other tasks while listening (mechanical only, nothing that requires concentration or beyond-reflexes thinking). To say it is intense is like saying that water are wet. I really love the style, and the narration is excellent. The story itself is very good, extremely detailed and believable and I simply love the characters. I am really pissed that the book ended in a cliff hanger, and as I am in the process of downloading the second book in the series right now, I woudl be seriously considering&#xA0;starting to listen to it right now, if I didn&#x27;t have about an hour to wait for it to get down. As a side result of this, I am on an Email Strike, which means that I am only giving cursory look in my inbox, which has ~70 unread conversations.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Scott Bellware brings up one of the most annoying habits from Microsoft, duplicating existing OSS stuff instead of promoting the use of the existing tool. He ends up the post by asking how long it will take before Microsoft will have its own mocking framework. On the theoretical possibility that they would do such a thing, let me express my feeling about this in advance:  I would be extremely pleased if Microsoft came out with a mocking framework that completely and utterly kicked Rhino Mocks&#x27; butt. I would be very happy because it would mean that I would get mocking for free, instead of spending quite a bit of time to make it work. That would mean that it would not look like this one, by the way. Somehow, I have my doubts that Microsoft would turn out something of Rhino Mocks&#x27; elegance. And if I say so myself, Rhino Mocks is one of the finest pieces of code that I have written.  That said, if they want a mocking framework, Rhino Mocks is FLOSS (free libre open source software), so they certainly have the possibility to just bundle it in (and even rename it to Microsoft Mocking if they really want to). That is what I wish they would have done for NUnit, Cruise Control, etc. If integration is what they want to offer, it is certainly something that all those projects would accept gladly. I know that I would.</p>
