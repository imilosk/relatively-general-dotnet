            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am having quite a few interesting discussions at DevTeach, and one of those had to do with introducing projections and processes against opposition. For myself, I am a... bit forceful about such suggestions, especially in face of stupid opposition. One of the things that came up was simply to do it, the old &quot;it is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission&quot;. I am both supportive for that and not really comfortable with the idea. I support it because it is a way to actually get things done, but I got a really good example of why it is not always a smart idea. The story was using Rhino Mocks for mocking, with some team members starting to use it without proper introduction.  The resulting code created tests that passed, but had a strong coupling to the code under test (too many mocks, too much expectation).&#xA0;When the code change, the test broke, because it was specifying too much. For myself, I have&#xA0;seen similar issues that can result as slipping stuff under the radar, which is why I am not comfortable with that in most cases. It is not always the case, continuous integration is one such case in which there isn&#x27;t usually a problem in just setting it up. But if you are adding a dependency to the system, you need to make it clear to the team how it works. Doing otherwise introduce the bus factor, damage the ability of the team, and a host of other problems. By the way, this doesn&#x27;t mean that all your team members have to have a vote in any dependency, or any pattern, but it does mean that they all should be aware of them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Ivan&#xA0;also posted a response to Jeremy&#x27;s C# vNext features, and he said something that caught my eye:  5. Metaprogramming =&gt; no objection here although you can do it now with reflection emit  No, there is a big difference between reflection emit and byte code weaving. Reflection emit is done after compilation is completed, meta programming occurs during compilation. This matters because it means that your code cannot refer to the results of the change being made. A case in point, I am using IL Weaving to add the Dispose method&#xA0;to a class, but because I am doing it after compilation is completed, I cannot call the Dispose() method on the class, or put it in a using statement, in the same assembly, I would get a compiler error, because the method (and the interface) are not there yet. Using meta programming, the compiler will know that those now exist, and it can not start using it, because it happened during the compilation process. The implication of that are pretty significant, if you are talking about what you can and can&#x27;t do in terms of enriching the language.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Nikhil&#xA0;has a post about using MS Ajax with MS MVC*. What was particulary interesting to me was that it reminded me very strongly of posts that I wrote, exploring Ajax in MonoRail. The method used was the same, the only changes were exteremely minute details, such as different method names with the same intention, etc. * Can we please get better names for those?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Bill Wagner&#xA0;has a proposal about the usage of mixins. He is talking about having a marker interface with minimal methods (or no methods), and then extending that using extension methods. To a point, he is correct, this will give you some sense of&#xA0;what a mixin is. But it is not enough. &#xA0; It is not enough because of the following reasons:  It is not really a cohesive solution. There is no really good way to specify something like SnapshotMixin. You need interface and static class and inherit from the marker interface, etc. Those are... problematic. I want to just be able to say: &quot;also give me the functionality of this class&quot; A more important issue is one of state. The examples in Bill&#x27;s proposal are all stateless methods, but I want to have a stateful mixin. I can think of several hacks around that, but they are hacks, not a proper way to work.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeremy Miller asks what we want in C# vNext. I have only real one request, to have meta programming of sufficent power, after which will be able to add all the required semantics without having the compiler team to argue with. I am not holding my breath on that one, though. I can just imagine the arguments against it (let us start from the potentail for abuse, move to version and backward compatability hell, and then move forward).  I&#xA0; want to go over Jeremy&#x27;s list, and see what I can add there.  Mixin&#x27;s&#xA0;- Agree 102%. This is something that would so useful, I can&#x27;t realy understand how it is not already there. Make it a magic attribute, something like [Mixing(typeof(IFoo), typeof(FooImpl))], and you can get away with it with just compiler magic, no changes required to the CLR. Symbols - I am ambivelent on that one. Syntatic sugar is important, but I have other things that I would value more. Make hashes a language feature - I think that you can do it right now with this syntax:var hash = new Hash(&#xA;&#x9;Color =&gt; &quot;red&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;Width =&gt; 15&#xA;);&#xA;Automatic delegation ala Ruby or Objective C - Um, isn&#x27;t this just mixin?&#xA;Metaprogramming!&#xA0;- absolutely. This is something that I have gotten to consider as basic. I am getting tired of having to fight the compiler to get the code that I want to have. The code should express my meaning, I shouldn&#x27;t have to dance to the compiler&#x27;s tune.&#xA;Everything is virtual by default to make mocking easier - I certainly would like that, but I fear that this is not something that will be changed. AOP as a platorm concept, now that is something that I want to see.&#xA;My own request covers:&#xA;&#xA;memberinfo() - the CLR already has this concept, so we just need the syntax for it.&#xA;Method Interception - let us start with the easy stuff, I want to be able to intercept methods from any type. I can do it now if I want to mess with the profiler API, but that is not something that I can really make use of for production.&#xA;IDynamicObject - I want method missing, damn it! It is just the scratch of meta programming, but this is something that you could probably add to the compiler in a week.&#xA;Static interfaces. Since we already has generics to allow us to treat types as interchangable types, I want to extend this concept by just a bit, to get it to work in a more reasonable manner.&#xA;I have a few more, but they just called my flight.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I speak quite often about DSL and how to build them, but so far I did not do was explain why you need a DSL at all. After all, since you are reading this blog, you already know how to program. Can&#x2019;t we just use &#x201C;normal&#x201D; programming languages to do the same job? We can even do with a dash of fluent interfaces and Domain Driven Design to make the code easier to read. We need to inspect the different needs that lead the drive toward a DSL. A Technical DSL  A technical DSL is supposed to be consumed by someone that understands development. It is meant to express matters in a more concise form, but it is still very much a programming language at heart. The main difference is that it is a language focused on solving the specific problem at hand. As such, it has all the benefits (and drawbacks) of single purpose languages. Examples for technical DSL include Rake, Binsor, Rhino ETL, etc. The driving force around that is that you want to have richer expressiveness in specifying what you want to happen. Technical DSL are usually easier to write, because your target audience already understands programming. In fact, the use of programming features can make a DSL very sweet indeed. We have already seen a Rake sample, so let us see a Binsor sample: for type in Assembly.Load(&#x201C;MyApplication.Web&#x201D;).GetTypes():&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; continue unless type.IsAssignableFrom(Controller)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; component type.FullName, type So we take three lines to register all the controllers in the application. That is quite a bit of expressiveness. Of course, it assumes that you are familiar with the API and its usage, which is not always true, which leads nicely to business focused DSL A Business DSL A business DSL is focused on being (at least) readable&#xA0;to a businessperson with no background in programming.  This type of DSL is mainly expressive in the terms of the domain, and it has a lot less emphasis on the programming features that may still exists. It is also tend to be much more declarative than technical DSL in general and a lot more emphasis is placed on the nature of the DSL so those would not really be necessary.  I can&#x2019;t really think of a good example of a business DSL in the open. A good example of DSL that I have run into include a cellular company that had to have some way to handle all the myriad of different contracts and benefits that it had. It also needed to handle this with a fairly rapid time to market, since the company needed to respond quickly to market conditions.  The end result was a DSL in which you could specify the different conditions and their results. For instance, to specify that you get 300 minutes free if you speak over 300 minutes a month, you would write something similar to this: if CallMinutesForCurrentMonth &gt; 300 and HasBenefit &#x201C;300 Minutes Free!!!&#x201D;:&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; AddCallMinutes -300, &quot;300 Minutes Free!!!&quot; It was fairly simple to define a small language that could describe most of the types of benefits that the company wanted to express. The rest was a matter of naming conventions and dropping files in a specified folder, to be picked up and processed at regular intervals. The structure that surrounds a DSL is a subject that deserves quite a bit of attention on its own. A businessperson may not always be able to write actions using a business DSL (more on that later), but they should be able to read and understand it. After all, it is their business and their domain that you are trying to describe.  Now, why shouldn&#x2019;t a businessperson be able to write actions using a business DSL?  The main reason, as I see it, is of error handling. No, I don&#x2019;t mean in the actual running of the DSL action, I mean when writing it.  A DSL is supposed to be read like a language, but it is still a programming language, and those have little tolerance for such thing as bad casing for keywords, for instance. Certain types of users will simply be unable to go over the first hurdle in the road they face, because of this. It is important to know your audience, and it is even more important not to be contemptuous toward that mythical businessperson. You may not think that this person can understand programming, only to discover that there are quite a bit of automation going on in their life already, powered by VBScript and excel macros. If you can leverage this knowledge, you have a very powerful combination in your hand, because you can provide that businessperson the tools, and he can provide the knowledge and the required perspective. Automation DSL I am not quite sure about this classification, but it certainly has its place. Another name for this may be the IT DSL. This type of a DSL it often used to expose the internal of an application to the outside world.  Modern games are usually engines that are being configured using some sort of a DSL. In fact, I fondly remember building levels in Neverwinters Nights. More serious usage for this can certainly be found, such as a DSL that lets you go into the internals of an application and mange it. Think about the ability to run a script that will take re-route all traffic from a server, wait for all current work to complete, and then take the server down, update it and bring it up again.  Right now, it is possible to do this with shell scripts of various kinds, but most enterprise application can certainly have more visibility into them than already exist, and a DSL that will allow me to inspect and modify the internal state would be very welcome. I can certainly think of a few administrators who would be grateful to have more power in their hands. &#xA0; To conclude, can you think of other types of DSL in use?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Andrey Shchekin&#xA0;made a good point when he commented on my post about graphical DSL:  I do not use DSLs that are purely graphical. But talking about documentation, I think it is very useful to have a graphical _representation_ for some DSLs that is synchronized with (or generated from) the DSL itself.For example, any workflows or dataflows (think Rhino ETL) are much easier to see at a glance on visual surface. Editing them on visual surface is also an option, but not a requirement. I certainly am a believer that a DSL should be mostly declarative, and indeed, taking Rhino ETL as an example, it is something that can have a visual representation. The only remaining question is how? Long ago there was Lithium and Netron projects, which were good for building the kind of UI that a DSL is composed of. Those have gone commercial now, and while I can probably find the originals somewhere, that is not a very promising concept. There is always the Visual Studio DSL toolkit, but I have a strong suspicion that I&#xA0;would not like it (COM involved), and anyway, I want to do it externally to Visual Studio. Anyone familiar with useful libraries that can make it happen? Ideally, it would allow me to generate UI similar to the class designer. It should also be simple, but I am not sure how to really quantify that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Another form of DSL is the graphical&#xA0;domain specific language.&#xA0; What do I mean by that? I am talking a DSL that is not textual, but rather uses shapes and lines in order to express intent. A good example would be UML. That is a DSL for describing software systems. In fact, quite a lot of money and effort has been devoted to making UML the One True Model, from which you can generate the rest of the application. There has been also a lot of effort invested in making it possible to write your own graphical DSL. Microsoft has the Visual Studio DSL Tools, which is a framework that allows you to build tools similar to the class designer and generate code off of them. Existing examples of Graphical DSL that comes to mind are: &#xB7; UML &#xB7; BizTalk &#xB7; Sql Server Integration Services &#xB7; Workflow Foundation I don&#x2019;t like graphical DSL. To be rather more exact, I simply love graphical DSL for documentation, but I find that they make a rather poor job when it comes to actual development. I have some experience with all of the above, and I can say confidently that they all share common problems, and that those are inherit to the graphical DSL model.  For a start, any problem of any real complexity would be very hard to build using a graphical DSL. Just arranging all the shapes in a way that you can browse them easily takes significant bits of time, and then you get to the issue of actually understanding what this thing does.  The whole point of a graphical DSL is to hide information that you don&#x2019;t want to see, to let you see &#x201C;big picture&#x201D;. All of which means that you can&#x2019;t really see the whole at the same time, and this leads to a lot of time spent jumping between various elements on the DSL surface, trying to gather all the required data. And then there are UI issues that are important. How do I do a search &amp; replace operation in a graphical DSL? How can I just look for something? And, of course, there is a reason why mouse driven development is not a good idea, if only for your wrist. Beyond that, there are serious issues with how do you make a reasonable diff between two versions. No, reading XML files diff (assuming they are even diffable) don&#x2019;t work, you need some way to express diffs in a graphical way, and so far I haven&#x2019;t seen any good way to do that. From an implementation perspective, there are other issues that you need to consider. In a graphical DSL, the need to express things visually is pretty important, so we need to have some conventions about what shapes and connections we have. The actual what and how will depend on the actual language that you are trying to implement. If you haven&#x2019;t guessed so far, I am not a fan of graphical DSL. Not for programming, at least, it is a valuable tool for documentation and design, but quite a few people are pushing it too hard.</p>
