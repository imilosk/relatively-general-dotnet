            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB has been using the low level Esent as our storage engine from day 1. We toyed with building our own storage engine in Munin, but it was only in 2013 that we started pay serious attention to that. A large part of that was the realization that Esent is great, but it isn&#x2019;t without its own issues and bugs (it is relatively easy to get it into referencing invalid memory, for example, if you run multiple defrag operations), that we have to work around. But two major reasons were behind our decision to invest a lot of time and effort into building Voron. When a customer has an issue, they don&#x2019;t care that this is some separate component that is causing it, we need to be able to provide them with an answer, fast. And escalating to Microsoft works, but it is cumbersome and in many cases result in a game of telephone. This can be amusing when you see kids do it, but not so much fun when it is an irate customer with a serious problem on the phone. The second reason is that Esent was not designed for our workload. It has done great by us, but it isn&#x2019;t something that we can take and tweak and file away all the rough edges in our own usage. In order to provide the level of performance and flexibility we need, we have to own every critical piece in our stack, and Voron was the result of that. Voron was released as part of RavenDB 3.0, and we have some customers running the biggest databases on it, battle testing it in production for the past two&#x2B; years. With RavenDB 4.0, we have made Voron the only storage engine we support, and have extended it further. In particular, we added low level data structures that changed some operations from O(M * logN)&#xA0; to O(logN), push more functionality to the storage engine itself and simplified the concurrency model. In Voron 3.0, the only data structure that we had was the B&#x2B;Tree, we had multiple of those, and you could recurse them, but that was it. Data was stored in the following manner:  Documents tree (key: document id, value: document json) Etag tree (key: etag, value: document key) We had one B&#x2B;Tree as the primary, which contained the actual data, and a number of additional indexes, which allow us to search on additional fields, then find the relevant data by lookin up in the data tree.  This had two issues. The first was that our code needed to manually make sure that we were updating all the index trees whenever we updated/deleted/created any values. The second was that a scan over an index would result in the code first doing an O(logN) search over the index tree, then for each matching result it do another lookup to the actual data tree. In practice, this only showed up as a problem when you have over 200 million entries, in which case the performance cost was noticeable. But for that purpose, and for a bunch of other (which we&#x2019;ll discuss in the next post) we made the following changes to Voron.  We now have 4 data structures supported.  B&#x2B;Tree &#x2013; same as before, variable size key &amp; value. Fixed Sized B&#x2B;Tree &#x2013; int64 key, and fixed size (can be configured at creation time) size of value. Same as the one above, but let us take advantage of various optimization when we know what the total size is. Raw data section &#x2013; allow to store data, and give an opaque id to access the data later. Table &#x2013; combination of raw data sections with any number of indexes. The raw data section is interesting, because it allows us to just ask it to store a bunch of data, and get an id back (int64), and it has an O(1) cost for accessing those values using the id.  We then use this id as the value in the B&#x2B;Tree, which means that our structure now looks like this:  Raw data sections &#x2013; [document json, document json, etc] Documents tree (key: document id, value: raw data section id) Etags tree (key: etag, value: raw data section id) So now getting the results from the etags tree is an seek into the tree O(logN), and then just O(1) cost for each document that we need to get from there. Another very important aspect is the fact that Voron is based on memory mapped files, which allows some really interesting optimization opportunities. But that will be the subject of the next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most important features in RavenDB is replication, and the ability to use a replica node to get high availability and load balancing across all nodes. And yes, there are users who choose to run on a single instance, or want to have a hot backup, but not pay for an additional license because they don&#x2019;t need the high availability mode. Hence, RavenDB 3.5 will introduce the Hot Spare mode:  A hot spare is a RavenDB node that is available only as a replication target. It cannot be used for answering queries or talking with clients, but it will get all the data from your server and keep it safe. If there is a failure of the main node , an admin can light up the hot spare, which will turn the hot spare license into a normal license for a period of 96 hours. At that point, the RavenDB server will behave normally as a standard server, clients will be able to failover to it, etc. After the 96 hours are up, it will revert back to hot spare mode, but the administrator will not be able to activate it again without purchasing another hot spare license. The general idea is that this license is going to be significantly cheaper than a full RavenDB license, but provides a layer of protection for the application. We would still recommend that you&#x2019;ll get for a full cluster, but for users that just want the reassurance that they can hit the breaker and switch, without going into the full cluster investment, that is a good first step. We&#x2019;ll announce pricing for this when we release 3.5.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So the first thing to tackle is the over the wire protocol. RavenDB is a REST based system, working purely within HTTP. A lot of that was because at the time of conception, REST was pretty much the thing, so it was natural to go ahead with that. For many reasons, that has been the right decision.  The ability to easily debug the over the wire protocol with a widely available tool like Fiddler makes it very easy to support in production, script it using curl or wget and in general make it easier to understand what is going on.  On the other hand, there are a bunch of things that we messed up on. In particular, RavenDB is using the HTTP headers to pass the the document metadata. At the time, that seemed like an elegant decision, and something that is easily in line with how REST is supposed to work. In practice, this limited the kind of metadata that we can use to stuff that can pass through HTTP headers, and forced some constraints on us (case insensitivity, for example), and there have been several cases where proxies of various kind inserted their own metadata that ended up in RavenDB, sometimes resulting in bad things happening. When looking at RavenDB 4.0, we made the following decisions:  We are still going to use HTTP as the primary communication mechanism. Unless we have a good reason to avoid it, we are going to be human readable over the wire. So now instead of sending document metadata as HTTP headers, we send them inside the document, and use headers only to control HTTP itself. That said, we have taken the time to analyze our protocol, and we found multiple places where we can do much better. In particular, the existence of web sockets means that there are certain scenarios that just became tremendously simpler for us. RavenDB has several needs for bidirectional communications. Bulk inserts, Change API, subscriptions, etc. The fact that web sockets are now pretty much available across the board means that we have a much easier time dealing with those scenarios. In fact, the presence of web sockets in general is going to have a major impact on how we are doing replication, but that will be the topic of another post. Beyond the raw over the wire protocol, we also looked at a common source for bugs, issues and trouble: IIS. Hosting under IIS means that you are playing by IIS rules, which can be really hard to do if you aren&#x2019;t a classic web application. In particular, IIS has certain ideas about size of requests, their duration, the time you have to shut down or start up, etc. In certain configurations, IIS will just decide to puke on you (if you have a long URL, it will return 404, with no indication why, for example), resulting in escalated support calls.&#xA0; One particular support call happened because a database took too long to open (as a result of a rude shutdown by IIS), which resulted in IIS aborting the thread and hanging the entire server because of an abandoned mutex. Fun stuff like that. In RavenDB 4.0 we are going to be using Kestrel exclusively, which simplify our life considerably. You can still front it with IIS, of course (or ngnix, etc), for operational, logging, etc reasons. But this means that RavenDB will be running its own process, worry about its own initialization, shutdown, etc. It makes our life much easier. That is about it for the protocol bits, in the next post, I&#x2019;ll talk about the most important aspect of a database, how the data actually gets stored on disk.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that happens when you start using RavenDB is that you start using more of it, and more of its capabilities. The problem there is that often users end up with a common set of stuff that they use, and they need to apply it across multiple databases (and across multiple servers).  This is where the Global Configuration option comes into play. This allows you to define the behavior of the system once, and have it apply to all your databases, and using the RavenDB Cluster option, you can apply it across all you nodes in on go.  As you can see in the image, we are allowing to configure this globally, for the entire server (or multiple servers), instead of having to remember to configure it for each. The rest of the tabs are pretty much the same manner. You can configure global behavior (and override it on individual databases, of course). Aside from the fact that it is available cluster-wide, this isn&#x2019;t a major feature, or a complex one, but it is one that is going to make it easier for the operations team to work with RavenDB.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned in my previous post that one of the things that pushed the design of RavenDB 4.0 is retrospective analysis. In particular, , &quot;if we had to do it all over again, rewind the clock to 2008, and design RavenDB from the ground up with all the knowledge that we currently have, what would we do differently?&quot;. The problem with this approach is that we have shipping software, we have stuff that customers have been using for over six years, so it isn&#x2019;t like we can start from scratch, and as tempting a decision that would be, it is almost always the wrong decision. RavenDB 4.0 isn&#x2019;t a re-write, it is a major architectural change, driven by own experience in what is painful.&#xA;That is a good guideline, but what does this mean? We had a few rounds of thoughts around this, and we ended up with the following decisions.&#xA;As a major version release, we aren&#x2019;t bound by backward compatibility, and we are going to take full advantage of that. That means that a 4.0 server cannot be accessed by a 3.0 client, and a 3.0 server can&#x2019;t replicate to a 4.0 server. From the point of view of the wire protocol, we have taken the chance to fix some long standing issues, but I&#x2019;ll have another post about that. Internally, an upgrade from 3.0 to 4.0 will probably be done by a dedicated migration tool, unlike the previous &#x201C;in place&#x201D; upgrade procedure that we previously had. The reason for those decisions is that this gives us a lot of flexibility in fixing our implementation and change how we are doing things.&#xA;At the same time, from an external point of view, users of RavenDB should see as little change as we can get away with. Ideally, the process of upgrading a new piece of software to RavenDB 4.0 should be:&#xA;&#xA;Update the Nuget package&#xA;Recompile&#xA;&#xA;And that would be it. In practice, I&#x2019;m sure that we&#x2019;ll have edge cases and things that would require a bit more work from the user, but that is the goal, that as far as users are concerned, they don&#x2019;t have to do a lot of extra work to upgrade.&#xA;We&#x2019;ll probably have a lot of discussions around what exactly we can change, and what we must absolutely have. In some of the discussion we had with our customers we already learn that running on 32 bits is a hard requirement for some of them, which means that RavenDB 4.0 will support that, even if that makes our life quite a bit more complex.&#xA;As a reminder, we have the RavenDB Conference in Texas in a few months, which would be an excellent opportunity to learn about RavenDB 4.0 and the direction in which we are going.</p>
