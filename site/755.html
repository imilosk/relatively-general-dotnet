The main reason is that I was stupid and didn&#x27;t take into account how long it will take to get a visa, and I also forgot that right now there is a huge concentration of holidays, so the embassy is apparently swamped with requests, and taking longer to process them even than the usual. :-(</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I routinely get a lot of emails with questions about the various stuff that I do. That was wonderful while I could keep up with the flow, but it is not something that can really scale up. As a rule, I have started to refer all such questions to the appropriate channels for them.  For NHibernate: The NHibernate forums For Castle: Castle Forums or the Users Mailing List For Rhino Mocks: The Rhino Mocks Mailing List For Rhino Tools: The Rhino Tools Developers mailing list The reasoning behind this decision is very simple, I don&#x27;t have the time to help everyone, and in all those places, there are other people that are doing great job answering those questions.  This also means that over time, there is a wealth of knowledge gathered there, so make a search first, to see if the question has already been asked. As an exception to this, if you have a question about one of my posts, go ahead and send me an email about it. If you really want&#xA0;me to help you, contact me about commercial support.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post really annoys me, the author is talking about moving to Subversion from Bazar as the source control of the project, because people didn&#x27;t want to install Bazar, then he goes off and says this:  Unfortunately, this kind of laziness has become pervasive in the Free Software world, as compared to say 10 years ago. Back then it was all but expected that you&#x2019;d have to fix the build to get something working. But it was fine, because you would fix it and send a quick patch. Believe it or not, this actually felt pretty awesome. You were helping to keep the train on the tracks, and that meant getting your hands messy. I had to read it thrice to get it through.&#xA0;This guy is talking about Open Source software, and he seems to think that putting more road blocks in the way of participation in a project is a good thing. WTF?! I don&#x27;t know about that, but I know that as a member of several OSS projects, the teams usually try to minimize the amount of work that you need to either use and / or develop in the project. Not only does it make sense, but it means that other people can get started easily. To do otherwise is to make sure that people would not use the project. This may be some sort of an &quot;acceptance criteria&quot;, but it is a stupid one. You are not paying people to do it, you are asking them to give up valuable time in order to figure out your stuff. It is your duty to make it easier, not to complain about them not passing the hurdle that you put there. Then there is this, in the comments, which is more relevant to the post:  By the way, saying how you &#x201C;have to learn half a dozen different vcs tools&#x201D; would mean that you&#x2019;re working on half a dozen different projects, which is quite unlikely isn&#x2019;t it? Right now in my OSS folder there are 18 projects that I keep track of. And there are at least 10 others that I checkout and delete from time to time. They all use subversion. This means that the barrier to entry into a project is finding the project URL, checking out the trunk, and then waiting for it to complete. The barrier for entry in any other system is a lot higher. I need to install a new SCM, lean how to use it, how to generate a patch, diff, etc. This is a non trivial cost, and not something that I am willing to do unless you have a really good reason. If presses, I would probably use CVS, but I don&#x27;t really like it. Using anything else requires not only memorizing a new set of commands, but also grokking another SCM model entirely.  If you want to get contributors, you need to tempt, not to hunt.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Bret is talking about tracking an issue with Watir that appeared after the application was migrated from ASP.Net to Ruby on Rails (IE issue, apparently).   I think the reason we haven&#x2019;t seen this problem before is because our .Net apps have been a lot slower that Rails. Slow enough to keep this IE bug from showing up. That is certainly something that I have seen before. The main problem is not the runtime performance, it is the initial performance. If I make a change to a page, I have to wait ~30 seconds for it to load. Contrast that with making a change to a MonoRail view, where a change in the view appears instantly. The problem is that changing the controller requires re-compilation, which has the same performance penalties.  This is something that kept me annoyed, but it is getting more so lately, because I can feel the difference between changing the view (brail, instant) and the controller (C#, ~30 seconds), where before anything that changed caused the same long delay. As far as I can tell, this has to do with AppDomain load / unload, but I never really bothered to take a look. William&#xA0;was talking about this same problem a while ago. This may not affect the runtime production performance, but it plays hell with the developer&#x27;s performance.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time required for half of a sample to undergo radioactive decay. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halflife Scott Bellware&#xA0;is talking about the rate of decay of the maintainability of a project.   The rate of decay of maintainability is the measure of how fast your maintainable code looses it&#x27;s maintainability after your agile development guru or consultant moves on to another project. This is a subject of a particular concern of mine, since I was often accused of building software that only I could work with. I am currently teaching an MSPD course with the express purpose of grokking the way that the average developers go about their work. It has given me a lot of insight into why Microsoft does some things (and I still vehemently disagree with the decision).  I taught data access approach using With and anonymous delegates: With.Transaction(delegate(SqlCommand cmd)&#xA;{&#xA;   cmd.CommandText = &quot;SELECT COUNT(*) FORM Customers&quot;;&#xA;   return (int)cmd.ExecuteScalar();&#xA;});&#xA;This is for people who learned C# as part of the course. It works, and while this is not something that they are likely to build on their own, once you set up the infrastructure and explain how it works, there weren&#x27;t particular issues with this.&#xA;The crux of Scott&#x27;s post is this statement:&#xA;&#xA;The keystone of intentional maintainability, nestled in the slot at the apex of an arch of XP practices, is code that is instantly understandable by the folks who have to do the maintenance.&#xA;That is an argument that I have had with quite a few people, quite often. Because the problem is with the definition&#xA0;of &quot;the folks who have to do the maintenance&quot;. At one time, I had a... discussion with someone that thought that they can hire someone off the street (purposefully low level, to keep costs down) and have them start working on a big (10 months of continuous development) project from day 1.&#xA;That meant, as far as they were concerned, that we were to use only the &quot;standard&quot; approaches, so we wouldn&#x27;t break the wizards and make the application &quot;unmaintainable&quot;. That is not maintainable in my book, quite the opposite, frankly. &#xA;From my point of view, an application is maintainable if I can take someone of the street, give them the overall view of how things work, walk them through a use case or two, and then set them on the code on their own.&#xA;This method belongs to the LoginController, and I am going to assume that it is going to be instantly understandable my most people who can read code.&#xA0;But, and this is important, it is not maintainable unless you figure out what is going on all around it. &#xA;/// &lt;summary&gt;&#xA;/// Authenticates the specified user, will redirect to the destination page&#xA;/// if the login is successful.&#xA;/// &lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;/// &lt;remarks&gt;&#xA;/// If the login is not successful, additional information may be found on:&#xA;/// Scope.Flash[Constants.ErrorMessage]&#xA;/// &lt;/remarks&gt;&#xA;/// &lt;param name=&quot;user&quot;&gt;The user.&lt;/param&gt;&#xA;/// &lt;param name=&quot;password&quot;&gt;The password.&lt;/param&gt;&#xA;/// &lt;returns&gt;True if the user has authenticated successfully, false otherwise&lt;/returns&gt;&#xA;public virtual bool Authenticate(string user, string pass word)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;bool isValidLogin = authenticationService.IsValidLogin(user, password);&#xA;&#x9;if (isValidLogin)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Usage.SuccessfulLogin(user);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;string returnUrl = Scope.Input[Constants.ReturnUrl];&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Context.AuthenticateAndRedirect(returnUrl, user);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;else&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Context.AuthenticateAndRedirect(Settings.Default.HomePageUrl, user);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return true;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;Usage.FailedLogin(user);&#xA;&#x9;Context.SignOut();&#xA;&#x9;Scope.ErrorMessage = Resources.BadUserOrPassword;&#xA;&#x9;return false;&#xA;}&#xA;I think that I have done a moderately good job in making my recent projects maintainable without me, and I am trying to make sure that there won&#x27;t be many cases of &quot;This is Oren&#x27;s CodeTM, I can&#x27;t touch that&quot;. We aren&#x27;t there yet, but we are getting there. Another developer is going to take over a project that I have led, and I have confidence that after the initial panic, things would settle down.&#xA;My criteria for maintainability if that if you know X, Y and Z (usually technologies that I use in the project, mainly NHibernate), you should be able to get everything from the code.&#xA;Then again, my current project&#x27;s Guide to the New Developer does have two pages dedicated to dependencies and links to the documentation...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Dave Laribee&#xA0;is talking about measuring line counts and code quality. He mentions that in the Ruby&#x27;s community is is considered a value to express yourself in fewer lines of code. Recently I had to do some statistics over my project, and I was astonished to discover that it was closing rapidly to the 150,000 lines of code. That made me wonder what another project line count was, I was pretty sure that it would be closer to half a million lines of code, but I was floored when I discovered that it barely reached the 30,000 lines of code. There is no comparison between the ease of working with both projects. The bigger one is a pleasure to work with, and the smaller is just plain hard. I was the main developer of the small project, and I have learn a lot from it (what not to do :-) ). I don&#x27;t think that a lower line count is really meaningful, unless you also have the context of how it is used. Here is another example, Rhino Mocks is at about ~25,000 lines of code, most of those are tests, the core library is about 10,000 lines, but only 4,801 lines of code (vs. xml comments, etc). To compare to that, I just check the most complex use case in my application, which is composed out of the following:  Controller: 400  Controller Finders: 531  Code Behind: 479  ASPX: 1,261 (roughly 500 of those are javascript) So a bit over 2,600 lines of code (not including infrastructure), for a single use case.&#xA0;  It is also the Murphy Zone in the application, the one we would rather not touch (it is about five times as large as any of the other use cases), because it touches so many other things. (And naturally, we had to fix a bug there yesterday :-), not liking to touch and afraid to of touching are two different things). So, I don&#x27;t want to agree with lower LOC is a good thing, and I do want to be more expressive when I write the code. I am not sure where it puts me. But I do know that the end result is that we want to be able to get simple code at all costs. (Not stupid code, simple code.) This means that reducing line count should be accompanied with increase in the code clarity. At any rate, just a bit of my own experience in this debate.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Scott Bellware&#xA0;is talking about application embedded databases, an application that is the sole domain of the application that is using it. I don&#x27;t like the term, because embedded databases have another meaning, but I fully support the idea that the database should be an implementation detail of the applications. I had a project where we needed to use an existing database, and I want to cry when I think about the length and breath of of effort that we had to go through to get it to really work. In the last project, I have had at one time to change the DB password daily, to keep [Some Other Party] from trying to integrate with the application through the database. (In the end, we create a separate database, just for them, and they integrate through it). The problems with per application databases are silos and getting the data out to other applications. This bring us back to the data outlives the application, etc. I have a longer post in the pipeline that is going to talk about that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeremy Miller&#xA0;made the mistake of opening the DataSet.Designer.cs file&#xA0;and got:  You know the orange bars that ReSharper puts into the vertical scroll bar to denote warnings in the code?&#xA0; In the DataSet code it looked like a solid bar of orange sherbert.&#xA0; The discussion in the comments is about the quality of generated code, and it is fairly interesting. As someone who does quite a bit with code generation, I wanted to note two things:  The quality of the generated code is the result of the generator, with the qualification that the generated code may be used to off load nasty parts of the code base. The code generated by NHQG is doing some really crazy stuff with generics and operator overloading, and it is something that can get very hairy very fast. The other issue is that the use of CodeDOM means that you are often specifying redundant things. In this case, this this.myName and the fully qualified namespaces could go away, and this is something that ReSharper detects and warns against. public virtual Query_Post&lt;T1&gt; With() {&#xA;&#x9;Query_Post&lt;T1&gt; query = new Query_Post&lt;T1&gt;(this, this.myName, this.associationPath);&#xA;&#x9;query.joinType = NHibernate.SqlCommand.JoinType.InnerJoin;&#xA;&#x9;query.fetchMode = NHibernate.FetchMode.Default;&#xA;&#x9;return query;&#xA;}&#xA;It is not code generation in general that is problematic, in my view, it is the use of code generation to cover problems with the underlying platform that is usually what is causing the pain.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently had a chance to go through several legacy applications, bug spotting in one and evaluating the possibilities of code reuse in another. Stuff like &quot;a most applicable approach to the Fertilizer pattern&quot; began to run on my head as I read it, and at one point I had to go away to be able to curse in private (there were ladies present). Some of the things that I run into (across all the applications):  Goto inside a grid implementation, after a little fact finding, it was discovered that they lost the original source, and just copy / pasted the result of Reflector&#x27;s de-compilation and moved on. SQL Injection problems in stored procedures that were found by reading the documentation. Naming convention like bo_showinui, id_file, nm_folder, tx_folderpath We fixed the bug (which made me learn some stuff about double hop windows authentication and citrix, of all the things in the world, and we will not be reusing the code. In retrospect, I should have known, everyone else went to the far side of the room when I started reading the code...</p>
