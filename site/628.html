When I came back to the hotel, I was still pumped from what I was doing today, so I found myself at 22:30 PM writing code for the project that I am currently working on. I find myself writing code at odd hours often, but usually I am able to put down whatever I am working on without much trouble.&#xA;Right now it is 5:30AM, and I am up again, and with the benefit of alarm clock. Got several hours to kill before I got to work. Time to work on NH Prof.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The concept of reducing the cost of change is a one of the core values of agile practitioners. In essence, it boils down to being able to make changes when we want them. Practices such as TDD and Iterations enable us to actually make changes without attaching a high price point for them. Some tools make change much easier than others. Using NHibernate, I can evolve my data model (and notice that I am explicitly talking about data models, not domain models. This is using NHibernate just for DTO mapping) much more rapidly than if I am using SP or code gen. If I have a real domain model, then that is even easier, in most cases. But it is neither the tools not the practices that actually enable change. They are not even significantly responsible for reducing the cost of change. Beyond anything else, it is the will of the team to accept the pain of making the change and actually doing this. I recently had a meeting in which I presented a demo of my current project. During the meeting, we hashed together what the application is doing, and in what way it is supposed to work. By that afternoon, I was able to get it to work using the new model. It involved breaking the entire application to pieces and restructuring it from the fragments. That wasn&#x27;t pleasant, and it took me half a day of just trying, but it was done. When I demoed it to the client in the same afternoon, he was quite pleased. I am not sure that I managed to covey the actual reason that I was able to affect such a change in the application. It doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with technology, it has to do with a mindset. I would have been able to do the same if the application was written using ASP Classic with Stored Procedures, not as easily, maybe, but within roughly the same time frame. That mindset, at least for me, starts from the first line of code. I treat each piece of the project as utterly disposable. Since I don&#x27;t really care how each individual piece works, I am able to roughly sketch a fair amount of the application very rapidly, and then focus on each of the items in isolation, and replace that with a much better implementation. I think that I stated before that I tend to rewrite most of my application core at least two or three times before I am happy with them. When you have disposable pieces, it is no big deal if you mess up and need to start over, because the whole project is structured in a way that allows you to do so. Going back to using my current project as an example, the algorithm used for the core part of the system is crap. I thought it up while being on a coffee break, and it is enough to demonstrate what the software is supposed to be doing. I don&#x27;t really care, because the moment that I do need the real algorithm, I can drop it in (need to change the implementation of a single method). But it is not just preparing ahead. It is also just plain willingness to do the work. About a year or two ago we (Castle Team) wanted to be make document all the public API for Castle Active Record. If I recall correctly, I did it by asking the compiler to break the build if we didn&#x27;t have an appropriate XML comment for all out public types and members. There were some 800 build errors. And the only way to fix them was to go and document all of them. It took several days, but then it was done. I don&#x27;t think it was pleasant by any stretch of the word, but by trying we were able to make it happen. So, to conclude, the best way I know to reduce the cost of change is to actually accept change. After that, the reduction will happen on its own.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am currently in the process of retiring the IRepository&lt;T&gt; from Rhino.Commons. I am moving it to its own set of projects, and I am not going to give it much attention in the future.   Note: Backward comparability is maintained, as long as you reference the new DLLs. But why am I doing that? If there is anything that I have been thought in the last couple of years is that there is a sharp and clear distinction between technological infrastructure (web frameworks, IoC containers, OR/M) and application infrastructure (layer super type, base services, conventions). The first can and should be made common, but trying to make the application infrastructure shared between multiple projects that aren&#x27;t closely matched is likely to cause a lot of issues. To take the IRepository&lt;T&gt; example, it currently have over 50 methods. If that isn&#x27;t a violation of SRP, I don&#x27;t know what is. Hell, you can even execute a stored procedure using the IRepository&lt;T&gt; infrastructure. That is too much. What will I use instead? A project focused infrastructure. A repository interface reflect the application that is using it, and it changes from project to project and even in the same project as our understanding of how the project is built improve. I am still considering what to do with the other tidbits that I have there, such as the EntitiesToRepositories implementation. Ideally, I want to keep Rhino Commons focused on only session management, and nothing else beside.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As you probably know by now, I have been working on an ASP.Net MVC project for the last two weeks. Based on that, I think that I can base a pretty good opinion about it.&#xA;Are you ready for it?&#xA;[insert significant pause here]&#xA;I like it.&#xA;Now, just to be clear. I like it not only in comparison to WebForms. I like it on its own. In other words, I don&#x27;t consider the ASP.Net MVC to be a default choice if all you have is that or WebForms.&#xA;The pros of using an MVC framework are well known by now, so I wouldn&#x27;t go blathering about that. ASP.Net MVC certainly hits a lot of those points. Another benefit that wasn&#x27;t obvious to me was the default view engine, which uses the same WebForms editor. This means that we get intellisense. That was surprisingly nice to have.&#xA;Unfortunately, the WebForms view engine is also useless for any intermediate to advance scenarios, because it only allows you to render directly to the response, and doesn&#x27;t allow you to capture the output of views and partials and process them further.&#xA;Another problem that I encountered with the framework is that, to someone who has been doing MVC for years, is it extremely non obvious at times. My default mode of learning is to dive into the code, and in general, this has been a successful way of doing things across many projects that I learned. I don&#x27;t really like it that I run into brick walls along the way with ASP.Net MVC, but I should point out that my thinking about how things should work is based on my work with MonoRail, and it is likely affecting my expectation about the way the ASP.Net MVC behaves. Even so, there are several design decisions made there that I strongly disagree with.&#xA;The most problematic issue that I run into with the ASP.Net MVC during the last too weeks, and the reason that I don&#x27;t consider the ASP.Net MVC vs. MonoRail to be a coin toss, is that a lot of the code is internal.&#xA;Now, I didn&#x27;t actually went over the ASP.Net MVC source code. But I did tried to do things with it and was blocked several times because some of the things that I wanted to do are internal (IBuildManager comes to mind as a repeated example). The obsession with internal, and the resulting limitations of what I can do with the framework, is a huge problem for me in just about any Microsoft product. In this project, I explicitly didn&#x27;t set out to create any complex site. I built a very trivial data driven CMS. Nevertheless, I hit a lot of those internal API, grr!&#xA;Most of those occur when trying to do anything interesting with the web forms view engine. There is enough friction using that that is it worth dropping it (web forms view engine) all together, even with the bonus of having intellisense in the views.&#xA;From the point of view of actual framework, I found it pleasant to work with for most of the time. And the extensions points that are open are very useful (OnActionExecuting, OnActionExecuted are good example of that). I think that in order to really get the benefits of the framework, I am going to have follow Jeremy Miller&#x27;s footsteps and rip out all the thinks that I don&#x27;t care about and replace them with a heavily opinionated and customized version.&#xA;The good news is that it is possible, and without too much problem.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">At some point of my code, I had this method.  Remember, this is spike code, so I didn&#x27;t care for breaking things like encapsulation or getting ugly code. In essence, the code above is breaking encapsulation and stomps all over DRY and Liskov substitution principle.  It worked for a while, then it stopped. The reason that it stopped is that I started passing it lazy instances. And a lazy instance is a proxy, which is neither an ImageItem or HtmlItem. So now ContentItem has the following:   As an aside, notice the RecordApperances method. That is the absolute top of Ask, don&#x27;t tell.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got more than a few comments from people that were upset about my &quot;attacks&quot; on ASP.Net MVC. I wanted to clarify a few things.  I don&#x27;t think that they are attacks, they are simply documenting frictions points that I find myself running into. And as usual, I write them as I go along, so you get whatever impression I had at the time. So if I am frustrated or annoyed, the post would most certainly reflect that. I have been doing the exact same thing for over 4 years now. And I don&#x27;t think that the ASP.Net MVC is getting any special treatment here. I am treating that much the same way that I would any other piece of software that I use. Finally, I would like to explain the method to the madness. I write about what I am currently doing. And in order to be blog worthy, it has to be either above or below average.  ASP.Net MVC currently falls in a very bad place in that regard. There is very little that it does that is above average to me, but as a new framework that I am using, there is a lot of annoying friction. The reason that it is unlikely that ASP.Net MVC will truly impress me is unrelated to the actual framework, I have been working on MonoRail for the last four years. I know MVC. There are some things that I actually like in the ASP.Net MVC framework, but they aren&#x27;t individually important enough for me to blog about it. I do plan to write a post about ASP.Net MVC sometimes in the near future, and so far, it is going to be a mostly positive post. To the point, however, I am writing about what I do. Plain and simple. I have made significant mistakes in the past, and I&#x27;ll do them in the future again. I can live with that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Take a look at the following code. What would you expect the result of this code to be?   Leaving aside the question of exactly what I am doing here, or why. What I thought this should do was to render the partial view into the string writer. The method signature of Render most strongly suggest that this is what it would do. What it actually does is to render the partial view directly into the response. Following the code a bit more, it looks like you literally cannot do this. ASP.Net MVC views are hard coded to use the current request ( ViewPage.RenderView ). I checked a bit, and without basically faking the entire HttpContext and all its associated objects, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening. There are two problems here:  The API lies about what it is doing There is no simple &amp; obvious way to get the output of a view except directly into the response.</p>
