            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was recently asked to contrast the business decisions related to the profiler and RavenDB. I thought that it would make an excellent post.  There are a lot of aspects to thing about here, actually. The profiler is an add on tool, it is only useful if you are using one of the supported OR/Ms, but if you do&#x2026; it:     has very low barrier to entry, you need to reference the dll and add a single line of code.    provides immediate value, you can see the benefits that it gives you.    have very few moving parts that users can break.   NH Prof was released on Jan 1st, 2009. The first sale happened on Jan 2nd, 2009 (thanks Yann!).   The lead time for the profiler tends to be very short. Because there is very little that you need to invest and there is a lot that you gain. Yesterday I introduced a guy to the profiler as a way to help him see what his app is doing, he made a purchase about an hour later.  That is excellent news from my point of view. :-)  RavenDB, on the other hand:     has a very high barrier to entry, not so much from technical perspective, but from adoption one.    requires you to make significant changes to the way you work.    takes time to show why it is beneficial.    requires payment only when you actually goes live.    requires much higher degree of support for users.   That means that while it takes a few minutes to decide if you want the profiler (and the rest of the 30 days trial is spent getting corporate approving it :-) ), for RavenDB the lead time until you pull out your credit card is much longer.  That has some interesting implications. I actually spent a lot more (time &amp; money) in the profiler than I spent (outright) on RavenDB. But the major difference is what type of investment that would be.  There is a term in economics called sunk cost, that is all the costs associated with building a product up to the point you released it. That is money already spent. But what usually matter a lot more is that once you reached the release point, can the cash flow from a product justify the continued work on the product ( and maybe, at some point, pay for the product development) ?  NH Prof was a big investment for me, but money started coming in shortly afterward, and it became apparent that it was sustainable product. For RavenDB, the costs have actually been a lot lower (since the majority of them represented my own time), but the expectation is that it would take about a year or two before it would be be possible to say if RavenDB is a sustainable product.  In that sense, RavenDB represent a lot riskier investment. If RavenDB wasn&#x2019;t rattling in my head for so long, I would have probably would have gone to something with much shorter lead time.  It is interesting to me to see how many factors there are in those sort of decisions.&#xA0; So many things to balance.</p>

I am going to show off a lot of the new features in NHibernate 3.0, Steve Strong is going to discuss Linq to NHibernate and what you can do with it. For extra fun, I am also to spend an hour discussing worst practices in NHibernate. That is going to be an hour full of ranting &amp; raving, which should be amusing.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;ll be speaking in JAOO 2010, giving an Introduction to RavenDB in the NoSQL track. This is going to be the first time that I am going to show RavenDB in a major conference, and I am just a tiny bit nervous. This is going to be interesting, because I am going to present to people who are experienced in NoSQL solutions.  In addition to my talk (obviously the highlight of the entire conference :-) ), there are other sessions that I really want to be at:          Rx: curing your asynchronous programming blues - Erik Meijer. This is something that have been popping into my sights for a while, but never long enough to sit down and really study it. So I think I&#x2019;ll take a shortcut through this session :-)            Lessons Learned in Large HTTP-Centric Systems &#x2013; Jim Webber. There are two reasons to go to one of Jim&#x2019;s talks. The first is the content, the second is the actual presentation style. Take a look at some of his talks to see what I means.            Building a Pet Store that will Survive Cyber - Cameron Purdy. This presentation interests me mostly because I don&#x2019;t believe that what is suggest can be delivered (virtually unlimited scaling in a generic fashion), so it would be very interesting to see what is going on there.            Where to put data - Michael T. Nygard. I usually learn new things from Michael, so I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing what he has to say about this.            And the conference gods have actually managed to set things up so I&#x2019;ll be able to be in all of those sessions, and not be busy giving a parallel session.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This seems like a minor thing, but it was raised during the design phase of SilverQueues/AgQueues/LuminQ (can someone spot the jokes?).   How does a client identify itself to the server? Consider the fact that there are likely to be clients popping up all the time, so we can&#x2019;t pre-assign them with meaningful names. The suggestion was brought up to use GUIDs to identify the client. That has the benefit of simplicity. It is easy to write, easy to implement and easy to understand from a conceptual level.  It got shot it down quickly, because while it is easy, I have never met the GUID that I could honestly say I have seen before. Recognizing clients by GUIDs is going to make it much harder to work with the system, however, because GUIDs are so opaque.   Instead of doing that, we will probably go with &#x201C;clients/329392&#x201D; or something similar, because that one is human readable. In the end, if you can make it easier to work with, it pays off, big time.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I noticed some jokes in twitters going around, people saying stuff like &#x201C;Using Fluent NHibernate, better not let @ayende find out about it&#x201D;.  I think that I better clarify a few things in this regard. When FNH initially came out, what I really wanted was auto mapping, and it didn&#x2019;t have that at the time (almost two years ago), but it does now. I also have some disagreement with the API choices (specifically, the decision to rename things from the NH mapping names).  But I am generally grouchy about code (whatever I wrote it or not), so that isn&#x2019;t unusual. I have used FNH in the past in a few of my projects, but it always came to a point where I needed more from NHibernate and FNH was limiting to me. Please note, I am explicitly referring to myself here, not the general public. I have been working with NHibernate for over 6 years now, and working with NHibernate at NHibernate&#x2019;s level is place that I am most conformable.  That isn&#x2019;t the case for a wide variety of other users. Today I had an interesting experience, of guiding a customer from no application to a full blown app using FNH. The entire process (with someone to whom it was the first introduction to NHibernate) took less than an hour, was remarkably pleasant and was focused on exactly the right things.  The Fluent NHibernate team has managed to create a truly remarkable project, well done.</p>
