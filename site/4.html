            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I talked about a massive amount of effort (2&#x2B; months of work) and about 25,000 lines of code changes. The only purpose of this task was to remove two locks from the system. During high load, we spent huge&#xA0;amounts of time contending for these locks, so removing them was well worth the effort.During this work, I essentially found myself in the guts of Voron (RavenDB&#x2019;s storage engine) and mostly dealing with old&#xA0;code. I&#x2019;m talking about code that was written between 10 and 15 years ago. I wrote a blog post about it at the time. Working with old code is an interesting experience, especially since most of this code was written by me. I can remember some of my thoughts from the time I wrote it.Old code is working code, and old code is also something that was built upon. Other parts of the codebase are making assumptions about the way the system behaves. And the more time a piece of code doesn&#x27;t change, the more likely its behavior is going to ossify. Changing old code is hard because of the many ways that such dependencies can express themselves. I dug through all of this decade-plus old code and I realized something pretty horrible. It turns out that I made a mistake&#xA0;in understanding how Windows implements buffering for memory-mapped files. I realized my mistake around mid-2024, see the related post for theactual details.The TLDR summary, however, is that when using unbuffered&#xA0;file I/O with memory-mapped files on Windows, you cannot expect the mapped memory to reflect the data written using the file I/O API. Windows calls it coherence, and it was quite confusing when I first realized what the problem was. It turns out that this applies only to unbuffered I/O and there is no such problem with buffered I/O. The scenario I needed to work with can&#xA0;use buffered I/O, however, which has been a profound shock to me. Large&#xA0;portions of the architecture of Voron are actually shaped by this limitation. Because I thought that you couldn&#x2019;t use both file I/O and memory-mapped files at the same time in Windows and get a consistent view of the data (the documentation literally says that, I have to add), RavenDB used memory-mapped I/O to write to the data file. That is&#xA0;a&#xA0;choice, certainly, but not one that I particularly liked. It was just that I was able to make things work and move on to other things.This is another tale of accidental complexity, actually. I had a problem and found a solution to it, which at the time I considered quite clever. Because I had a solution, I never tried to dig any deeper into it and figure out whether this is the only solution.This choice of using only memory-mapped I/O to write to the data file had consequences. In particular, it meant that:We had to map the data using read-write mode.There was no simple way to get an error if a write failed - since we just copied the data to memory, there was no actual write&#xA0;to fail. An error to write to disk would show up as a memory access violation (segmentation fault!) or just not show up at all.Writing to a page that isn&#x2019;t in memory may require us to read it first (even if we are overwriting all of it).I accepted those limitations because I thought that this was the only way to do things. When I realized that I was wrong, that opened up so many possibilities. As far as the refactoring work, the way Voron did things changed significantly. We are now mapping the data file as read-only and writing to it using file I/O.That means we have a known point of failure&#xA0;if we fail to write. That probably deserves some explanation. Failure to write to the disk can come in a bunch of ways. In particular, successfully writing to a file is not&#xA0;enough to safely store data, you also need to sync&#xA0;the file before you can be assured that the data is safe. The key here is that write &#x2B; sync ensures that you&#x2019;ll know that this either succeeded or failed. Here is the old way&#xA0;we were writing&#xA0;to the data file. Conceptually, this looks like this:auto mem = EnsureFileSize(pagesToWrite[pagesToWriteLength - 1].EndPosition);&#xD;&#xA;for(auto i = 0; i &lt; pagesToWriteLength; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xD;&#xA;{&#xD;&#xA;    auto path = pagesToWrite[i];&#xD;&#xA;    memcpy(mem &#x2B; page.Number * 8192, page.Buffer, page.Length);    &#xD;&#xA;}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;// some later time&#xD;&#xA;if(FAILED(msync(mem))&#xD;&#xA;   return SYNC_FAILURE;And here is the first iteration of using the file I/O API for writes.fallocate_if_needed(pagesToWrite[pagesToWriteLength - 1].EndPosition);&#xD;&#xA;for(auto i = 0; i &lt; pagesToWriteLength; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xD;&#xA;{&#xD;&#xA;    auto path = pagesToWrite[i];&#xD;&#xA;    if(FAILED(pwrite(page.Number * 8192, page.Buffer, page.Length)))&#xD;&#xA;         return WRITE_FAILURE;&#xD;&#xA;}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;// some time later&#xD;&#xA;if (FAILED(fdatasync(file))&#xD;&#xA;   return SYNC_FAILURE;Conceptually, this is just the same, but notice that we respond immediately to write failures here. When we started testing this feature, we realized something really interesting. The new version was much&#xA0;slower than the previous one, and it also generated a lot&#xA0;more disk writes.I moved mountains for this?Sometimes you get a deep sense of frustration when you look at benchmark results. The amount of work invested in this change is&#x2026; pretty high. And from an architectural point of view, I&#x2019;m loving&#xA0;it. The code is simpler, more robust, and allows us to cleanly do a lot&#xA0;more than we used to be able to.The code also should&#xA0;be much faster, but it wasn&#x2019;t. And given that performance is a critical aspect of RavenDB, that may cause us to scrap the whole thing. Looking more deeply into the issue, it turned out that my statement about old code and the state of the system was spot on. Take a look at the two code snippets above and consider how they look from the point of view of the operating system. In the case of the memcpy()&#xA0;version, there is a strong likelihood that the kernel isn&#x2019;t even involved (the pages are already paged in), and the only work done here is marking them as dirty (done by the CPU directly).That means that the OS will figure out that it has stuff to write to the disk either when we call msync() or when its own timer is called. On the other hand, when we call pwrite(), we involve the OS at every stage of the process, making it far more likely that it will start the actual write to the disk earlier. That means that we are wasting batching opportunities.In other words, because we used memory-mapped writes, we (accidentally, I might add) created a situation where we tried very hard to batch those writes in memory as much as possible. Another aspect here is that we are issuing a separate&#xA0;system call for each page. That means we are paying another high price. The good thing about this is that we now have a good way to deal&#xA0;with those issues. The pwrite()&#xA0;code above was simply the first version used to test things out. Since we now have the freedom&#xA0;to run, we can use whatever file I/O we want.In particular, RavenDB 7.1 now supports the notion of write modes, with the following possible options:mmap - exactly like previous versions, uses a writable memory map and memcpy()&#xA0;to write the values to the data file.file_io - uses&#xA0;pwrite()&#xA0;to write the data, onc page at a time, as shown above.vectored_file_io - uses pwritev()&#xA0;to write the data, merging adjacent writes to reduce the number of system calls we use (Posix only, since Windows has strict limits on this capability).io_ring - uses HIORING (Windows) / IO_Uring&#xA0;(Linux) to submit the whole set of work to the kernel as a single batch of operations.RavenDB will select the appropriate mode for the system on its own, usually selecting io_ring&#xA0;for modern Linux and Windows machines, and vectored_file_io&#xA0;for Mac. You can control that using the RAVEN_VORON_WRITER_MODE environment variable, but that is provided only because we want to have an escape hatch, not something that you are meant to configure.With those changes, we are on a much&#xA0;better footing for overall performance, but we aren&#x2019;t done yet! I would love to give you the performance numbers, but we didn&#x2019;t actually run the full test suite with just these changes. And that is because we aren&#x2019;t done yet, I&#x2019;ll cover that in the next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Even though RavenDB 7.0 isn&#x2019;t quite out of the gate yet (expect the release very&#xA0;soon), I want to start talking about the RavenDB 7.1 release. This release is going to represent the biggest change in RavenDB in about 7 years, and at the same time, it is expected to be a complete non-event for most people.We care enough about performance that we have both a dedicated team to verify it&#xA0;as well as really talented people whose sole job is to run benchmarks and optimize RavenDB. This year, the goal was to test RavenDB&#x2019;s performance when running on large&#xA0;machines (many hundreds of GBs or RAM, dozens of cores, etc). The idea was to find bottlenecks and remove them, and we quickly found a few. Performance optimization is often a very repetitive process. Find a problem, figure out the root cause, and move on. It is a process full of small changes and 0.1% improvements. The key is that if you practice this routinely, you end up with real measurable results over time, since your changes compound. Most of the time, these are the changes you celebrate:Here you can see a 6.6% increase in the number of operations per millisecond. That is a pretty big change, especially since it affects reading documents from storage. We were roughly two months into this process when we ran into the end of the line. The scenario in question was 95% reads / 5% writes, with the idea of seeing how quickly the system responds under load, but without stressing it to the limits. Take a look at our findings:What you can see here is that creating a transaction is&#xA0;costly, andover 50% of that cost is due to contention over a lock. We didn&#x2019;t notice that until we had a lot&#xA0;of cores to go around, since there wasn&#x2019;t a sufficient number of threads actively contending for this lock. Once we started looking for it, the problem was very apparent and visible on smaller machines as well. RavenDB creates a single transaction per request, so that means we are spending a lot of time doing essentially nothing useful. What is worse, this is actively&#xA0;spinning. So the more cores we have, the more CPU we&#x2019;ll use and the less useful work we&#x2019;ll do. Yuck!When we looked at the root cause, the problem became pretty apparent. Take a look at the following snippet:_txCreation.EnterReadLock(); // creating read transaction&#xD;&#xA;try&#xD;&#xA;{&#xD;&#xA;    _cancellationTokenSource.Token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    tx = new LowLevelTransaction(previous.LowLevelTransaction, transactionPersistentContext, context);&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    ActiveTransactions.Add(tx);&#xD;&#xA;}&#xD;&#xA;finally&#xD;&#xA;{&#xD;&#xA;    _txCreation.ExitReadLock();&#xD;&#xA;}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;using (PreventNewTransactions()) // during commit of write transaction&#xD;&#xA;{&#xD;&#xA;    if (tx.Committed &amp;&amp; tx.FlushedToJournal)&#xD;&#xA;        Interlocked.Exchange(ref _transactionsCounter, tx.Id);&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    State = tx.State;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Journal.Applicator.OnTransactionCommitted(tx);&#xD;&#xA;    ScratchBufferPool.UpdateCacheForPagerStatesOfAllScratches();&#xD;&#xA;    Journal.UpdateCacheForJournalSnapshots();&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    tx.OnAfterCommitWhenNewTransactionsPrevented();&#xD;&#xA;}What happens is that during the commit of a write transaction we need to make updates to a bunch of places. We also need all new read transactions to see all our changes at once. So during commit, we take a short lock to update a couple of locations. And when we create a write transaction, we hold a read lock to be able to properly read all those values safely.This particular code (and the approach in general) dates back to the very early days of Voron:On one hand, I look at this code and cringe internally. On the other&#xA0;hand, it has served us really well for a long time. Of course, on the gripping hand, that code has been around for long enough to have grown some barnacles. Notice the OnAfterCommitWhenNewTransactionsPrevented() call we have there? It is meant to allow other operations&#xA0;that need to run while no read transactions are allowed, in order to maintain in-memory consistency. Fixing this issue was both straightforward and quite complex at the same time. Instead of storing all the data in various places, I introduced the following record:record EnvironmentStateRecord(&#xD;&#xA;    Pager.State DataPagerState, &#xD;&#xA;    long TransactionId,&#xD;&#xA;    ImmutableDictionary&lt;long, PageFromScratchBuffer&gt; ScratchPagesTable,&#xD;&#xA;    TreeRootHeader Root,&#xD;&#xA;    long NextPageNumber,&#xD;&#xA;    (long Number, long Last4KWritePosition) Journal,&#xD;&#xA;    object ClientState);The actual details of what it does aren&#x2019;t really that interesting. What is important is that we have an immutable record that is being generated by the write transaction. That record contains all the database state that we carry over between transactions. When we want to publish this state, we can just make a single atomic write to a pointer, no need for a lock.Of course, it can&#x2019;t&#xA0;be that simple. We needed to essentially convert large portions of the code to take their state from the environment record and provide a way for higher-level code to add their own state to the record on write. That took about two months of hard&#xA0;work, I think. Not complicated work, just grinding through all of those places, figuring out the best way to represent that, and making all the necessary changes. Unfortunately, that wasn&#x2019;t the only lock convoy we found. Files inside RavenDB are held by a class called Pager (since it serves pages&#xA0;of data). A file (Pager) may hold multiple States, which is a fancy way of referring to a memory-mapped range we use. The Pager may hold multiple such&#xA0;mapping concurrently. For example, if we increase the file size, we need to map the memory again&#xA0;- so for a certain period of time, we have two such mappings.A transaction may create a reference to such a state (and thus may access the mapping) for its lifetime. At the end of the transaction, we can release the state, and if it is the last reference, we&#x2019;ll close the mapping. This is implemented using the following code:This runs for multiple&#xA0;Pagers for each transaction, mind you. The actual AddRef()&#xA0;call is very cheap, but the lock&#x2026;public void AddRef() =&gt; Interlocked.Increment(ref _refs);As you can see from the image, this is also pretty old code. The problem was how to deal with the issue. I have&#xA0;to be able to keep track of the mapped memory if a transaction is using it, but at the same time, I want to dispose of it quickly if it isn&#x2019;t being used. The answer to this question was to lean on the GC. Instead of implementing AddRef()&#xA0;/ Release(), I hold the Pager.State&#xA0;object and handle disposal in the finalizer. If there is a reference to it, the finalizer isn&#x2019;t called, so this gives me the exact behavior I want, for free. However&#x2026; I also need to be able to dispose of this explicitly when closing the pager. A common scenario is that I&#x2019;m closing the Pager and deleting the directory. If I have an outstanding reference to the file, that will fail. Here is how I&#x2019;m dealing with the issue. The Pager holds a Weak-Reference to the State and may explicitly dispose of it:public void Dispose()&#xD;&#xA;{&#xD;&#xA;    foreach (WeakReference&lt;State&gt; state in _states)&#xD;&#xA;    {&#xD;&#xA;        if (state.TryGetTarget(out var v))&#xD;&#xA;        {&#xD;&#xA;            v.Dispose();&#xD;&#xA;        }&#xD;&#xA;    }&#xD;&#xA;}That also allowed me to refactor the way we deal with files in general inside Voron. The first version of Voron did everything in managed code (including significant P/Invoke and cross-platform work). At some point, we introduced a native DLL (PAL - Platform Abstraction Layer - written in C) that allowed us to have a more consistent API.The issue was that there was no clean division of labor between the native C code and the managed code, and some responsibilities were split between them in a way that wasn&#x2019;t very clean. RavenDB is using ZigTo be rather more exact, I&#x2019;m using Zig as a build system to make cross-compilation a lot&#xA0;easier. I initially moved everything to use Zig, but it turns out that Zig isn&#x2019;t able to produce DLLs that would run properly on older versions of Windows. At least, nothing that I did convinced Zig to give me something that wouldn&#x2019;t fail to load. So we are still using MSVC to compile for Windows and then Zig to both Linux &amp; Mac (x64 &amp; ARM). If you have good ideas on how to solve that, I would really appreciate it.As a final thought, this work took several months, and when I got to the end, we got a pull request with some interesting numbers (&#x2B;11.3K LOC, -11.2K LOC). I have to admit that I feel a bit bad about that for the reviewers &#x1F642;. I was really hoping that I would get a net negative result in the number of lines changed, but that couldn&#x2019;t be helped. The end result is that all of our state is now far simpler, but we didn&#x2019;t actually change&#xA0;anything in the way we behave. We removed two frequently hit lock convoys and allowed RavenDB to be far more efficient. How efficient? Well&#x2026; that is a bit complex to answer, because we didn&#x2019;t stop here. There are more things that happened in RavenDB 7.1 that I need to talk to you about. We&#x2019;ll cover them in my next post.</p>
