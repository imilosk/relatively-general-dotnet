            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The following tidbit caused quite a bit of problem, and a loss of a day for two people. I&#x27;m working on legacy system right now, and part of this work is refactoring stuff without breaking the behavior. The process is quite big, but we managed quite fine until we suddenly started to get wildly different results. We traced is a dozen times, and eventually we narrowed it down to code that looked a bit like this (PL/SQL):            declare                        cursor offline_sales_cursor as                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; select product_id, customer_id, price                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; from offline_sales                                &#xA0;                        for sale in offline_sales_cursor                begin                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; insert into sales(product_id, customer_id, price)                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {sale.product_id, sale.customer_id, sale.price);                                &#xA0;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; exception                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; when DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; update sales                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; set price = sale.price                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; where product_id = sale.product_id                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; and customer_id = sale.customer_id;                        end;                        end loop;                                &#xA0;                        commit;        For the purpose of the discussion, sales has a primary key on product_id and customer_id (yes, it&#x27;s bad design, but it&#x27;s not a real db) and foreign keys to the products and customers tables. Can you guess what the problem was?    It turns out that we had an invalid customer id in the offline_sales table, which meant that this would run for a little bit, get a foreign key error and exit the loop and then commit part of the changes! When I refactored this bit, I changed it to two statements, one for updating and one for inserting, so the failure wasn&#x27;t writing anything. I looked at the code several times, and only caught this by accident (the code base has commits spread all over the place). Urgh! Urgh! Urgh! [Gnashing of teeth].</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The background, I am interested in saving some money, so I call up my bank and ask them to offer me a plan to do so. Apperantly I asked for something outside of the routine, so they need to get back to me.&#xA;While they are ponderring the mystreious reasoning behind my wish to give the bank the money, I thought about checking with a couple of other banks to see what they can offer. I tried six banks, and only in one of them I managed to get an estimate. I&#x27;m a reasonably smart guy, I think, and I couldn&#x27;t get them to cough a couple of figures.&#xA;I got the following replies:&#xA;&#xA;Call a branch, get an automated message that direct me to the central &quot;new and improved&quot; phone system. I couldn&#x27;t get through to the central phone system because I don&#x27;t have a customer number.&#xA;Call a branch, get an automated message to the central line, get through, ask my question and get an &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you that on the phone, you need to physically go to one of the branches and ask that.&#xA;Got a message telling me that they are very sorry, but they are busy right now, and will I please hold. After 20 minutes they hung up on me.&#xA;Got a live person, who directed me to another live person, who directed me to a dead end.&#xA;Urgh! How hard is it to give the bank my money? I thought that was what they were for!&#xA;I&#x27;m seriously re-considerring putting all my money under the mattress. At least it wouldn&#x27;t make me wait so long on the phone.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Clemens has a new post&#xA0;about O/R Mappers, and this time he brings up several relevant points that I agree with :-). He brings up a comment (by Scott E) from the previous post: I&#x27;ve hiked up the learning curve for Hibernate (the Java flavor) only to find that what time was saved in mapping basic CRUD functionality got eaten up by out-of-band custom data access (which always seems to be required) and tuning to get performance close to what it would have been with a more specialized, hand-coded DAL.     This comment seems to assume that the hand coded DAL will not need to be tuned, which I find hard to believe. Yes, there are times where you&#x27;ll need to tune the O/R where you will not need to tune the DAL, but the reverse is true as well. On general, O/R Mappers will generate better code than you&#x27;ll write (I can&#x27;t be smart on th 54th search SP that I write to do something a bit more complex than the code generator can handle). Defining and resolving associations is difficult. 1:N is hard, because you need to know what your N looks like. You don&#x27;t want to dehydrate 10000 objects to find a value in one of them or to calculate a sum over a column....     No, it&#x27;s not hard at all. You just need to define the association, the O/RM will take care of the rest. Both example that he gives can be done efficently by O/RM. Finding spesific values in an association:             select     p from Blog blog&#xA0;where blog.Id = @id count(blog.Posts.Comments) &gt; 50        Getting the sum of a property (not column, mind you):             select     sum(c.Credit) from Customer c where c.Id = @id        Both of this statements work on the logical representation of the class, not on the physical schema in the database. The second statement travese two 1:N relationships, without affecting performance. [That said, this is probably not the way to do this, using filtering on the collection is a better way to do it, and just as efficently.]1:N is so difficult because an object model is inherently about records, while SQL is about sets. N:M is harder.     I just wrote a post on using Active Record with many to many associations. Check it out, it&#x27;s not hard at all. Not even doing searching / filtering / aggregation on it.[in relation to in memory cache] What do you do if you happen to find an object you have already loaded as you resolve an 1:N association and realize that the object has meanwhile changed on disk?    Um, doesn&#x27;t this belong to my concurrency strategy? Either I use optimistic concurrency and throws when the row was updated, or I handle it before had. In genenral, the in memory cache is short lived, it has a life time of a single request, so this isn&#x27;t a problem. If it is, I can specify that the request will by-pass the first level cache.Another question is what the scope of the object identity is. Per appdomain/process, per machine or even a central object server (hope not)?    In NHibernate, the scope is the session you&#x27;re working on. A session is similar to a DbConnection in many ways, so it is usually a short lived object. Transactions are hard......&#xA0;If you are&#xA0;loading and managing data as object-graphs, how do you manage transaction isolation?&#xA0;How do you identify the subtree that&#x27;s being touched by a transaction? How do you manage rollbacks?&#xA0;What is a transaction, anyways?    A transaction is a kind of a poisonous snake that will give you ACID stomach, I believe.    Yes, transactions are hard. No, I don&#x27;t give them up when I&#x27;m using O/RM. I really don&#x27;t care about identifying the subtree that the transaction is working on, that is the job of the O/RM and the DB, not the application developer. Here is how I&#x27;ll manage a transaction:             using     (ITransaction trans = session.BeginTransaction(IsolationLevel.Snapshot))    {    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; //do stuff    &#xA0;&#xA0; trans.Commit();    }        This will rollback automatically on exception, of course, but I can do it manually if I really want as well. What is the problem with that again?Changing the underlying data model is hard.     No, it&#x27;s not. All your programming is done against the logical layout of your objects not aginst the physical schema. You want to change the data model? Just change the mapping, and you are done. There are some cases where you can&#x27;t do this without changing the code, but they would usually require code modifications to the code anyway.Reporting and data aggregation is hard.    Reporting is one thing that I&#x27;ll try to do in SQL, because the tools to do it are great, and because I&#x27;ll often be working on a de-normalized database, rather than my production one. But aggregation is easy. The example that Clemens gives is XPath vs. DOM manipulation. And he is correct, if I had to do this stuff manually, but I don&#x27;t. I get the O/RM to do this stuff for me (in the database, where those actions belong).    One thing that I&#x27;m not sure that I understood is: O/R is object-&gt;relational mapping.         LINQ is relational-&gt;object mapping. LINQ acknowledges the relational nature of the vast majority of data, while O/R attempts to deny it.     I&#x27;m not sure which O/RM he is talking about, but it&#x27;s not one that I have used. And O/RM that deny the relational nature of the data just isn&#x27;t going to work well.&#xA0;It seems to me that Clemens had a bad experiance with O/RMs (maybe the C&#x2B;&#x2B; one that he mentions?) and didn&#x27;t look into the current offering in the field with enough depth. I just don&#x27;t see many of the problems that he mentions as real problems unless you misuse the tools that you have.    That said, O/RM are indeed a leaky abstraction, and you need to understand what is happening under the cover, but GC is a leaky abstraction as well, and still it seems like a great productivity tool nonetheless.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Hammet has posted a comment from his article about Castle. The comment basically talks about reuse in NVelocity, one of the MonoRail&#x27;s View Engines.     NVelocity is not a full fledge programming language, and that means that you can&#x27;t do some things that you can do with a full langauge (at least not easily). The end result is that you really don&#x27;t want to write TheUberGrid in NVelocity, so you may end up writing a one-off, per scenario template, instead of a general control that can accept anything you throws at it and is infinitely more configurable.    Surprisingly enough, or maybe not, the one-off effort usually pays better dividends in terms of the amount of effort involved to get what you need. There is quite a bit to say about specialized solutions to those problems. I had an UberGrid myself, and in order to add a new datatype, I need to edit a dictionary of type &gt; parsing delegate. Sure, it can handle everything from enum localization to showing descriptive text of every object in the system. But I dread the day that I&#x27;ll have to display the same object in two different forms, since that is not supported, and will require major re-writing.    We&#x27;re using this UberGrid quite a bit, and it&#x27;s... nice. But it doesn&#x27;t really gives us anything. I still code the template per page, setting all the parameters, ordering, etc. It would be just as much work to do it in place, and there wouldn&#x27;t be any duplication of effort&#xA0;or code. More and more, I&#x27;m leaning toward simpler solutions, rather than complex ones.    On the surface, the simple solution may not have all the quantities to do interplanetary navigation (which I don&#x27;t relish doing in NVelocity), but I find that more often than not, I don&#x27;t need to do this kind of stuff in those scenario. Good design will keep duplication away, but it shouldn&#x27;t, and mustn&#x27;t be at the cost of additional complexity or abstraction.    One off solutions, to one off scenarios are not to be discouraged. When you get the second duplicate scenario, then it is time to start worrying about reusing staff. And because you already got a working implementation, it will be much easier.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This isn&#x27;t new, but it is a great resource&#xA0;for doing phone interviews for developers. It&#x27;s more than just the questions and answers, it is the whole thought process behind it that is impressive.    By the way, I&#x27;m feeling extremely tired in the last couple of days, which is why I don&#x27;t have real content in here. We made a major breakthrough today, so I hope that I either be so tired that I won&#x27;t be able to blog, or so pumped up that I will have to blog.</p>
