            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After a lot of trouble, I&#x2019;m really happy that I was able to build an async I/O implementation of my protocol. However, for real code, I think that I would probably recommend using with the sync API instead, since at least that is straightforward and doesn&#x2019;t incur so much overhead at development time. The async stuff is still very much a &#x201C;use at your own risk&#x201D; kind of deal from my perspective. And I can&#x2019;t imagine trying to use it in a large project and no suffering from the complexity.As a good example, take a look at the following bit of code:It doesn&#x2019;t seem to be doing much, right? And it is clear what the intent of the code is. However, if you try to compile this code you&#x2019;ll get:Now, it took me a long while to figure out what is going on.&#xA0; The issue is that the code I&#x2019;m seeing isn&#x2019;t the actual code, because of macro expansions. So let&#x2019;s resolve this and see what the expanded code looks like:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Glancing at this code doesn&#x2019;t tell me what the problem was, so I tried replacing the method with the expanded result, and I got the same error, but this time I got it on a line that helped me figure it out. Here is the issue:We use the ? to return early from the poll method, and the Receiver I&#x2019;m using in this case is defined to have a Result&lt;String, ()&gt;, so this is the cause of the problem.I returned my own error type as a result, giving me the ability to convert from (), but that was a really hard thing to resolve. It might be better to have Rust also offer to show the error on the expanded code by default, because it was somewhat of a chore to actually get to this.What made this oh so confusing is that I had the exact same code, but using a Stream&lt;String, io:Error&gt; that worked, obviously. But it was decidedly non obvious to see what was the difference between two identical pieces of code.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got into an interesting discussion about Event Sourcing in the comments for a post and that was interesting enough to make a post all of its own.Basically, Harry is suggesting (I&#x2019;m paraphrasing, and maybe not too accurately) a potential solution to the problem of having the computed model from all the events stored directly in memory. The idea is that you can pretty easily get machines with enough RAM to store stupendous amount of data in memory. That will give you all the benefits of being able to hold a rich domain model without any persistence constraints. It is also likely to be faster than any other solution.And to a point, I agree. It is likely to be faster, but that isn&#x2019;t enough to make this into a good solution for most problems. Let me to point out a few cases where this fails to be a good answer.If the only way you have to build your model is to replay your events, then that is going to be a problem when the server restarts. Assuming a reasonably size data model of 128GB or so, and assuming that we have enough events to build something like that, let&#x2019;s say about 0.5 TB of raw events, we are going to be in a world of hurt. Even assuming no I/O bottlenecks, I believe that it would be fair to state that you can process the events at a rate of 50 MB/sec. That gives us just under 3 hours to replay all the events from scratch. You can try to play games here, try to read in parallel, replay events on different streams independently, etc. But it is still going to take time. And enough time that this isn&#x2019;t a good technology to have without a good backup strategy, which means that you need to have at least a few of these machines and ensure that you have some failover between them. But even ignoring that, and assuming that you can indeed replay all your state from the events store, you are going to run into other problems with this kind of model.Put simply, if you have a model that is tens or hundreds of GB in size, there are two options for its internal structure. On the one hand, you may have a model where each item stands on its own, with no relations to other items. Or if there are any relations to other items, they are well scoped to the a particular root. Call it the Root Aggregate model, with no references between aggregates. You can make something like that work, because you have a good isolation between the different items in memory, so you can access one of them without impacting another. If you need to modify it, you can lock it for the duration, etc.However, if your model is interconnected, so you may traverse between one Root Aggregate to another, you are going to be faced with a much harder problem.In particular, because there are no hard breaks between the items in memory, you cannot safely / easily mutate a single item without worrying about access from another item to it. You could make everything single threaded, but that is a waste of a lot of horsepower, obviously.Another problem with in memory models is that they don&#x2019;t do such a good job of allowing you to rollback operations. If you run your code mutating objects and hit an exception, what is the current state of your data? You can resolve that. For example, you can decide that you have only immutable data in memory and replace that atomically. That&#x2026; works, but it requires a lot of discipline and make it complex to program against.Off the top of my head, you are going to be facing problems around atomicity, consistency and isolation of operations. We aren&#x2019;t worried about durability because this is purely in memory solution, but if we were to add that, we would have ACID, and that does ring a bell.The in memory solution sounds good, and it is usually very easy to start with, but it suffer from major issues when used in practice. To start with, how do you look at the data in production? That is something that you do surprisingly often, to figure out what is going on &#x201C;behind the scenes&#x201D;. So you need some way to peek into what is going on. If your data is in memory only, and you haven&#x2019;t thought about how to explore it to the outside, your only option is to attach a debugger, which is&#x2026; unfortunate. Given the reluctance to restart the server (startup time is high) you&#x2019;ll usually find that you have to provide some scripting that you can run in process to make changes, inspect things, etc. Versioning is also a major player here. Sooner or later you&#x2019;ll probably put the data inside a memory mapped to allow for (much) faster restarts, but then you have to worry about the structure of the data and how it is modified over time. None of the issues I have raised is super hard to figure out or fix, but in conjunction? They turn out to be a pretty big set of additional tasks that you have to do just to be in the same place you were before you started to put everything in memory to make things easier. In some cases, this is perfectly acceptable. For high frequency trading, for example, you would have an in memory model to make decisions on as fast as possible as well as a persistent model to query on the side. But for most cases, that is usually out of scope. It is interesting to write such a system, though.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">On my last post, I got really frustrated with tokio&#x2019;s complexity and wanted to move to use mio directly. The advantages are that the programming model is pretty simple, even if actually working with is is hard. Event loops can cause your logic to spread over many different locations and make it hard to follow. I started to go that path until I figure out just how much work it would take. I decided to give tokio a second change, and at this point, I looked into attempts to provide async/await functionality to Rust.It seems that at least some work is already available for this, using futures &#x2B; some Rust macros. That let me write code that is much more natural looking, and I actually managed to make it work.Before I get to the code, I want to point out some concerns that I have right now. The futures-await crate (and indeed, all of tokio) seems to be in a state of flux. There is an await in tokio, and I think that there is some merging around of all of those libraries into a single whole. What I don&#x2019;t know, and can&#x2019;t find any information about, is what I should actually be using, and how all the pieces come together. I have to note that even with async/await, the programming model is still somewhat awkward, but it is at a level that I can live with. Here is how I built it.First, we need to accept connections, which is done like so:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

We first do the TLS handshake, then we validate the certificate. If there is an auth error, we send it to the user and back off. If we are successful, however, things get interesting.I create a channel, which allow me to&#xA0; split off the read and write portions of the task. This means that I can send results out of order, if I wanted to, which is great for the actual protocol handling. The first thing to do is to send the OK string to the client, so they know that we successfully connected, then we spawn the read/write tasks. The write task is pretty simple, overall:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A large portion of my day to day tasks is to review code. I&#x2019;m writing this post barely two weeks into the new year, and we already had over 150 PRs going into RavenDB alone. As a result, I&#x2019;ve gotten sensitive to certain issues. For example, the following is a suggestion made for fixing an issue in this method declaration:This is a piece of code (in C) that is meant to handle some low level details for RavenDB. We use the CLR coding conventions for C#, but for C, we have chosen to use a different convention, using snake_case for methods, arguments and variables and SHOUTING_CASE for constants / defines. When reading through the code, I marked this violation of the naming convention for a fix.This may seem minor, but it is probably annoying for the author of the code. They are interested in comments about the code functionality and utility. Why spend any time on something that doesn&#x2019;t really have any impact? Both forms of the parameter name are just as readable to me, after all.Before I get to this part, I want to show another piece of code. Or, to be rather more exact, two pieces of code. One of the reasons that we are using C code is that we can abstract large parts of the underlying platform inside the native code. That means that we have certain parts of the code that are written twice. Once for Windows and once for Linux.Here is some code for Windows:And here is the same code for Linux:You can see that this is pretty much the same thing, just calling the different APIs for each platform. Once thing to notice here is that part of this method&#x2019;s task is to ensure that the file that we open is at least as big as the initially requested size.In Windows, to increase or decrease the file size you call SetFilePointer() followed by SetEndOfFile(). On Linux, you have fallocate() and ftruncate()*.This is reflected in the code. The Windows code has a single method to do this work and the Linux method has two methods. rvn_allocate_file_space() and rvn_truncate_file() which isn&#x2019;t shown here.* Actually, you might have fallocate(). Some file systems do not support it, and you need to use another workaround. One of my code review comments has been that this need to be fixed, that we should have a _resize_file() method for Linux that would simple call the appropriate method based on the file size. But the question is, why?These are two separate implementations for two separate operating systems. We are already creating the higher level abstraction level with operations that hide many system details. Why do I want to have a passthrough method just because the Windows code has this method?The answer here, as in the case above with the parameter name, is the same. Consistency.This it most obvious in the naming convention, but it is the same reasoning I had when I wanted to have the same method structure for both Linux and Windows. Consistency is key for being able to slog through a lot of code. It is how I (and the rest of the team) can go through thousands of lines of code per week and understand what is going on. Because when we look at a piece of code, it follow certain conventions and structure. Reading the code is easy because we can ignore a lot of cruft around it and focus on what is going on.In the case of the Windows / Linux methods, I first read one method and then the next, making sure that we are doing the same thing on all platforms. The different behavior (resize vs. allocate) was very obvious to me, which meant that I had to stop, go and look at each method&#x2019;s implementation to figure out whatever there is any meaningful difference between them. That was a chore, and it would only become worse over time as we add additional functionality, so anything that isn&#x2019;t different because it has to be different should match.In general, I like code reviews where I can scan through the changes and not see the code, but it&#x2019;s purpose. That happens when there isn&#x2019;t anything there that I really have to think about and the intent is clear.When writing in C#, we have decades (literally) of experience and organizational inertia that push us in the right direction. When push C code into the repository, I started to actually pay attention to those details explicitly, because I suddenly need to.This is apparent in code reviews, but it isn&#x2019;t just the case of me trying to make my own tasks easier. Code is read a lot more often than it is written, and focusing on making the code itself boring will pay off, because what the code is doing is what should be interesting in the long run.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I kept going with tokio for a while, I even got something that I think would eventually work. The whole concept is around streams, so I create a way to generate them. This is basically taking this code and making it async.&#xA;I gave up well into the second hour. Here is where I stopped:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I gave up when I realized that the reader I&#x2019;m using (which is SslStream) didn&#x2019;t seem to have poll_read. The way I&#x2019;m reading the code, it is supposed to, but I just threw up my hands at disgust at this time. If it this hard, it ain&#x2019;t going to happen.&#xA;I wrote significant amount of async code in C# at the time when events and callbacks were the only option and then when the TPL and ContinueWith was the way to go. That was hard, and async/await is a welcome relief, but the level of frustration and &#x201C;is this wrong, or am I really this stupid?&#x201D; that I got midway through is far too much.&#xA;Note that this isn&#x2019;t even about Rust. Some number of issues that I run into were because of Rust, but the major issue that I have here is that I&#x2019;m trying to write a function that can be expressed in a sync manner in less than 15 lines of code and took me about 10 minutes to write the first time. And after spending more hours than I&#x2019;m comfortable admitting, I couldn&#x2019;t get it to work. The programming model you have here, even if everything did work, means that you have to either decompose your behavior to streams and interact with them in this manner or you put everything as nested lambdas.&#xA;Either option doesn&#x2019;t make for a nice model to work with. I believe that there is another async I/O model for Rust, the MIO crate, which is based on the event loop model. I&#x2019;ve already implemented that in C, so that might be a more natural way to do things.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A nasty cousin of It Works On My Machine is the It Fails On That Machine. It is nasty because you know that there is something wrong, but you can&#x2019;t reproduce this. The machine in question was our Linux build agent, and the failure in question was a set of failing tests that failed to perform certain operation when TLS was enabled. The problem? They were failing with I/O errors, but only with TLS, and the connection was using localhost. Further investigation showed that the most likely reason for the failure was a timeout. But how could that be?&#xA0; For fun, sometimes, the test passed. So it wasn&#x2019;t an issue of a firewall of some such. Testing using openssl s_server and connecting to it manually didn&#x2019;t show any issues. The failures reproduced only on that particular build machine. Trying to reproduce the failure on other Linux machines failed. The problem was that these other machines had different kernel version (shouldn&#x2019;t matter, probably) or different openssl versions (which likely mattered). We started to investigate what the issue was and tried to setup a secured server on the box and connect to it.Which worked, so that sucked. Running the tests again showed them failing again&#x2026; which was confusing.Eventually we figured out that we couldn&#x2019;t make it fail when running a server outside the tests, but we could observe that it was slow. Slow as in, took ~2.5 seconds to reply to the client&#x2019;s hello message. We tried it in the debugger, and whenever we paused it, it was always some variant of the following:That led us to believe that there is something with openssl that could cause this slowdown. We tried to use strace to understand what it was doing, and we got stuff like this:To be rather exact, we got over 300,000 calls to openat with some file in that directory.That&#x2026; didn&#x2019;t seem right, to us. So we looked a bit deeper. As you can see, during the processing of an SSL connection, we can to X509Chain.Build, and that end up calling to X509Store.Certificates, and that end up reading all the certificates that you have on the &#x201C;~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/ca&#x201D; directory. That directory had&#x2026;. 2,103 certificates files in it. And every single time that we had to do anything with a certificate, we would go and scan through all of them, including paying all the cryptographic costs of verifying all those certs. If we had multiple threads doing that at the same time, we would run into starvation issues. Just a single pass through that was 2.5 seconds for a single core. The test scenario had 20 connections at a minimum going at once, and that was the reason for the timeouts. We basically run out of CPU because we were spending all of those cycles on the certs.And why did we have so many certs? The tests create a certificate every time that they run, and register that in the X509Store to make sure that certain features work. But we never delete it from the store&#x2026;. And over time, we had more and more certs going on there, until the load was big enough to start breaking things. Opps.</p>
