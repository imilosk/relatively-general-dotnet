            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A long while ago I moved the Rhino Tools repository to using MSBuild. I am not quite sure what the reason for that was. I think it was related to the ability to build it without any external dependencies. That is not a real consideration anymore, but I kept that up because it didn&#x27;t cause any pain.  Now, it does.  More specifically, I can&#x27;t build the rhino tools project on a machine that only have 3.5 on it. The reason is that I have a hard coded path with 2.0, which worked well enough, until I tried to work on 3.5 machine. In which case all hell broke loose.   Well, that is an easy fix, right? Just go and change the hard coded 2.0 to the current framework version, right?  Except that the msbuild doesn&#x27;t have any way to do that.  I am surprised, to say the least. And yes, I know that I can extend it to support this. I am not particularly sure that I want to, however. At this point, it would be easier to just move it to NAnt, I think. It would also align rhino tools with the tooling all its dependencies are using.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am sitting at the airport at the moment, having to burn some time before I can get on a flight, and I decided to make use of this time to review the Unity container from the P&amp;P group.  A few things before I start. Unity is a CTP at the moment, it is not done, and that is something that should be taken into account. I have several design opinions that conflict with the decisions that were made for Unity. I am a contributor to Windsor. Overall, I am biased. Please take that into account.  I am also going to put it through some of the paces that I put Windsor through. Just to see how it goes. Again, I am comparing a &gt; 4 years old container to a very new new, another thing to keep in mind. I do not foresee a situation in which I will use Unity over Windsor, but I do hope that this post will be helpful in future improvements to Unity.  A lot of this feedback is based on my experience and may contain comments that can be considered personal preferences.  Let us start with the things that I like:     This piece of code is very nice, and it is useful in many scenarios where the instance is created by an external source (Page instance, Forms, Web Services, and many more). At the moment, this is something that Windsor doesn&#x27;t have (I need two find a few hours free on a machine that has a development environment.      myContainer.BuildUp&lt;MyRealObject&gt;(myObject);    I am ambivalent as far as the Method Injection goes, in the abstract, I say cool, nice feature. The practical side says that it is mostly not required. Nevertheless, let us put it here.    The XML configuration is very clean and easy to follow. At least the sample ones that I have seen. I am not sure if it is possible to put it in an external file (not in app.config), but that is probably my only reservation with that.    The ability to configure instances from the configuration is cute. Especially if you add the converter support that you have there.&#xA0; It doesn&#x27;t seem, at least from a brief glance, that you can build complex objects there, though. That is not a bad thing, however :-)    It was a really good decision, to decouple the container and its configuration.   And now to the things that I don&#x27;t like:     The documentation (and a feature which attempts to resolve a type by default, even if it is not registered) direct toward having concrete class dependencies. I strongly dislike this, I think that except for rare cases, an interface should be used. And I generally dislike this feature.    For that matter, the ability to resolve a type that wasn&#x27;t registered in the container strikes me as problematic. There were some long discussions on that in the ALT.Net mailing list, and I can see the other side&#x27;s point of view. Yes, the container should enable this feature, but not in the common scenario. Preferably, add a method that make it explicit what you are doing.      According to the documentation, having several constructors will result if Unity picking one of them at random, and supplying its dependencies. I find the greediest possible ctor approach much more predictable, and a more natural model.    [DependencyConstructor] bothers me. This is the container invading into the application in an unseemly manner. It bothers me more that it is not optional if you have more than a single ctor.    Much worse, from the point of view of container ignorance, is the facilities for property injection. Here you have to specify [Dependency] on all the properties that you want injected. Again, this is the container reaching into my code and messing with that in unseemly ways. My code should have nothing to do with the container whatsoever. By the shape of my object, so will the container work. Not the other way around.    container.Get&lt;ISomethingMadeUp&gt;() will return a null reference if it can&#x27;t create the type. I think that this is the wrong design decision. It should definitely throw here. It means that instead of getting a nice exception &quot;ISomethingMadeUp is not registered&quot; I get &quot;Object not set to an instance of an object&quot;. While the ability to try resolve from the container is useful, it should be in a separate method. TryGet would be my preference for that.    Introspection capabilities are missing. That is, there is no way (that I could easily see, and I looked for one, to ask if a given type or a given extension are registered in the container. This is critical for many advance scenarios.    Something that I consider to be a sever bug, but from the code looks like a design decision, is ignoring missing dependencies when you resolve a component. That is, assume that you component Foo that have constructor dependency on ILogger. If you resolve Foo, and the container will not be able to find an ILogger implementation, it will pass null to the constructor. Read that one again. Instead of getting &quot;Cannot resolve Foo because ILogger cannot be constructed&quot; you are going to get &quot;Object reference not set to an instance of an object&quot;.      This is a problem, period.    Yes, you can use [Dependency(NotPresentBehavior)] to change that, but that is again, an invasive approach. Not a solution.    There is no protection from cycles in the dependency graph A depends of B depends on C depends on A. Again, you need to get a good exception here, explaining the problem. What you get is a stack overflow exception and bye bye to the program.    No support for generic components. That is, registering IFoo&lt;&gt; and getting IFoo&lt;string&gt;.    At a certain point, calling a method on the container will raise an event that will be handled by a strategy. Is seems like a very odd thing to me. The case in point is setting a component to be a singleton, I would have grabbed the singleton strategy directly and called that, instead of going through the event.    Life time support. Right now Unity supports two levels, singleton and transient. That is good, and you can probably extend that with policies. The problem is that those ideas are hard coded into the container interface. Off hand, you need at least local (per thread or per request) models as well. And I think that exposing singleton at the container interface is a mistake.    I haven&#x27;t seen how you can control the dependencies yet, which is a very important concern. That is, when I am building EmailSender, I want it to use port 435 and the file logger, instead of the email logger that everything else uses. This is a key feature, but reading the forums, this is currently a problematic feature.   Object Builder 2 Observations:     I like the use of dynamic methods to create instances, but the implementation (at least at first glance) seems awfully complicated. The main object that I have here is that you have the control flow of generating this method separated over a large number of objects and interfaces. The advantage that this give you is fine grain control over this process, but consider the task involved, this is a highly cohesive process, and you can&#x27;t really just plug your own stuff to it without properly understanding everything that goes there.    In the same vein, the use of policies and strategies for everything obscure the intent of the code. The DynamicMethodConstructorStrategy, for example, need to get the generation context, the existing parameter is use for that, which seems like a bad abuse of the given API. I would create an independent component with an API that would explicitly make this dependency. If you wanted the ability to replace that, have it registered in the container by default, then replace that before you resolve anything.    In the above case specifically, we have the existing parameter that sometimes holds the existing object, and sometimes holds the current context. That is not a friendly API.   I wanted to try Unity&#x27;s extensibility model, but I think that I put enough time in it already. What I have learned so far makes it pretty much pointless.  I wanted to build the StartableExtension, which automatically starts up components that implements the IStartable interface. On the surface, it is very simple, register to TypeRegister event, get the type and Start() it. The problem is that you need to wait until all the type&#x27;s dependencies are available. For example, I may register IHealthChecker before I register ILogger, which it need. There is no way in Unity at the moment to enable this scenario.  Something else that I would like to see is Unity&#x27;s version for Environment Validation. Here is is likely to be possible to do this, but it expose a problem with Unity&#x27;s dependency model. You can&#x27;t register arguments for a component, you can only do that globally, and that is if you are willing to perform invasive operation on your components.  Overall, I think that is an okay solution. You can see some Windsor influence in the API and in the configuration, which make me happy.  It has too many red lines there for me to be able to use it (even if Windsor wasn&#x27;t around), however. Some of the things that I have outlined here (error handling, for example) can be fixed easily enough, I am much more concerned with the design decisions that were made. Specifically, not throwing when a dependency is not found, both in the specific case of directly calling Get() and in the general case of resolving a dependency for a type that is currently being resolved.  The invasiveness of the container is one of the top issues that I would have fixed. That is one of the major reasons that CAB got lambasted.  I remember having to work with Object Builder circa 2005 - 2006, and it was a major pain. Unity looks significantly better than that. As well as the bits of Object Builder 2 that I have examined. I still object to the strategies / policies design, however, it seems like an overly generic solution. And methods like AddNew offend me for some reason. Add( new Foo() ) isn&#x27;t hard.   And, to save myself a lot of trouble later on, this is not an attack on Unity, this is simply me going over what is there and expressing my professional opinion on an early version of a project.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When creating a generic method, strongly prefer to supply an overload that is not generic, can accept the types manually, and is externally visible.  Reasoning: The generic version often looks significantly better than the non generic version, but it comes with a cost. It assumes that you know, up front, what the types are. When you are writing any type of generic code, this is almost always not the case and your generic method is useless in that scenario.  Example: myContainer.RegisterComponent&lt;IService, ServiceImpl&gt;(); is a good syntax to have, but the problem with that is that it cannot be used with this code:     foreach(Type type in GetComponentTypes())     {      &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; myContainer.RegisterComponent&lt;type.GetInterfaces()[0], type&gt;();      }   Since we cannot use the generic overload, we need to resort to trickery such as MakeGenericMethod and friends. This is costly at runtime, obscure and generally make life harder all around.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There were several comments for my recent post about the disadvantages of creating a single assembly for a project, instead of the more common multiply ones.  The main one seems to be related to dependency management. How you can be sure that the UI isn&#x27;t accessing the database, and other fun violations of layering.  I have to say that I don&#x27;t really have much issue with that. I want good layering, but I find that code style in a project tend to keep consistent over a long period of time in any reasonable time. As such, once you have sufficient size, it will more or less manage itself.  That isn&#x27;t going to be an acceptable answer for a lot of the people that want to have more control over that, I know. There are two answers to that, the first is from the human perspective, the second is from enforcement perspective. Let us deal with the first one first.  Make it easy to do the right thing. I seem to be saying that a lot lately, but this is a core concept that all developers needs to assimilate.  If loading a user from the database is as simple as:     usersRepository.Load(userID);   Then you can be certain that no one will try to write this:     using(SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(&quot;Data Source=LocalHost;Initial Catalog=MyAppDB;&quot;))    {    &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; connection.Open();     &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; SqlCommand cmd = connection.CreateCommand();      &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; cmd.CmmandText = &quot;SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = &quot; &#x2B;userId;    }   Yes, it is that simple. And yes, this assume non malicious people in the team. If you have those, termination is recommended. It is your choice whatever it would be of them or their employment.  Enforcement is easy as well. Get NDepends and setup the appropriate CQL queries. Something like: error if class in &quot;MyApp.UI&quot; references &quot;MyApp.Infrastructure&quot;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Back to technical content :-) This post from Kyle Baley got me thinking about my last few projects. In them, I trended toward the assembly per logical layer of the app. So I had things like:  MyApp.Model MyApp.Web MyApp.Services MyApp.Infrastructure MyApp.Tests It worked, but at one point I found myself managing 18 projects solutions, and that was only because I was committed to reducing the number (otherwise it would have been much higher). I hear about people talking about 30 - 60 projects in a single solution, and there are people with more. Considering the cost of just managing that (not to mention the cost for compilation per project), that sounds like a very bad approach. Right now, I think that on the next project I&#x27;ll have the following structure:  MyApp  /Model /Web /Services /Infrastructure MyApp.Tests Everything that the application does will be in a single project, without the need to split it off to a lot of separate projects. I found that the vaunted isolation that we seem to seek is achievable easily without forcing artificial barriers between the different parts of the application. It also means shorter compilation times and easier deployment mode. More than everything else, it means that I have less noise to deal with. I would extend that to an assembly per physical location, so assuming that I had a smart client application, I would use the following scheme:  MyApp.Server MyApp.Interfaces MyApp.Client MyApp.Tests And that would be it.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">(Image from Boing Boing) I don&#x27;t generally comment on such things, but in my recent trip to London, I had to go past the Heathrow Airport, and I found the security measures there... excessive. Especially in light of several other... observations that I made while in London. Those observations match across several countries (Canada, UK, Denmark, and I am pretty sure that it will match what I will find in USA). This is not an attack on the UK, this post was merely sparked by my recent trip there. You could say that I have a professional interest in terror and terrorists. And I spent some time trying to understand them. Living in Israel, a country with a long and bloody history of dealing with terrorism, certainly help bring the lesson home, even if I haven&#x27;t had personal experiences with it. Israel&#x27;s security forces, by and large, have long institutional memory with regard to how to handle potential threats, and I did my share of that a few times. As such, I have to say that while the security on Heathrow was excellent after you passed it, there seem to be zero security whatsoever until that point. A casual survey of the way that I would attempt to make any sabotage attempt suggested several routes that seems very opened for attack.  Now, to be clear, I despise terrorism to the depth of my soul, and I have little but contempt for the actions of people who believe that random killings and the attacks on civilians are a viable method of operation.  I can think of at least three non violent ways to cause problems that are going to bring as much news coverage, cause no loss of life or damage to property and are even likely to be legal. Oh, and they would be aggravating as hell itself.  That disclaimer aside, assuming that you can get a bomb (and you can find enough instructions in Google, even if you can&#x27;t get a basic chemistry book), there is a lot of damage that can be done easily enough. Just take the train. I got into the train by walking into the station with a large suitcase. At no point did I even see security, much less had them inspect what I was doing. I left the suitcase at one end of the train car and found an empty seat in almost the other end of the car. During the one hour ride, it appears that no one has noticed that there was an unattended suitcase that was just sitting there for a long period. Compare that to the experience that I expect to have in Israel. In nearly all public buildings (from the Mall to the Library), you have a guard that will ask to open your bags, and I can&#x27;t imagine an unattended bag sitting anywhere with people for a long period of time. People here notice that (and trains, bus stations and even on the buses themselves there are security guys that will generally catch this type of thing). Just to give you an example, here is what happens if you leave your laptop unattended in Israel. They shot it dead. Israel has very good reasons for this type of behavior. I went for a pub with a friend from the states not long ago, and we sat down in a place on the shores of Tel Aviv, and talked a bit. The discussion moved to terror at some point, and I began to list bombings in the area. That very pub we were sitting on, a club not 500 meters away, a bus on the next street, etc. And that was what I could recall off hand and at a moment&#x27;s notice. I do not expect it to be the same elsewhere, but I was disturb by the difference between level of security for getting on a plane vs. everything else. This post is getting long, morose and I have another flight to catch soon. It is also a subject that I tend not to talk about much, at least not on the blog, so I&#x27;ll wrap it up now. But that dissonance is annoying as hell, disturbing at many levels and irritating just about all my professional senses.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, apparently is is customary for bloggers that do not have anything to post to put some pictures of their cat. I don&#x27;t have a cat, but I have a this shy little dog that I adore, her name is Rose.   Of course, that doesn&#x27;t really give you any sense of scale, so here is her standing up, I am a big guy, her nose topped six feet by a fair margin. (about 1.85 for the civilized among us).   And, of course, the other side, here is her after I let her know that I am going away for a few weeks. I hope the bruises will heal soon, but for now, I need to move a bit carefully.   And no, it is not going to become a theme in this blog. But I found myself explaining to people on the phone all too often why they suddenly hear cries of &quot;No, you are not supposed to eat cats!&quot; and &quot;Damn it already, I am not edible, get that through your head&quot; or just &quot;Argh!&quot;. I hope this clarify things a bit.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Phil Haack is talking about why the MS MVC team changed IHttpContext to HttpContextBase. I follow the argument, but at some point, I just lost it. This, in particular, had me scratching my head in confusion:  Adding this method doesn&#x2019;t break older clients. Newer clients who might need to call this method can recompile and now call this new method if they wish. This is where we get the versioning benefits. How on earth does adding a new method to an interface would break an existing client? How on earth does adding a new method to an interface require a compilation from client code. Now, to be clear, when I am talking about changing the interface I am talking solely about adding new methods (or overloads), not about changing a method signature or removing a method. Those are hard breaking changes no matter what approach you take. By adding a method to an interface? That is mostly harmless. The only thing that require that is if you are implementing this interface, not if you are using it. It is possible that Phil is using the term clients in a far wider meaning than I would put on this, but this is not the general use of the term as I see it. Prefer abstract classes to interfaces, use internals and no virtual by defaults are three of the main issues that I have with the framework design guidelines. I have major issues with them because they are actively harming the users of the framework. Sure, it might make my work as a framework developer harder, but guess what, that is my job as a framework developer, to give the best experience that I can to my users. [Framework Design Guidelines rant over] Now, I do believe that I have some little experience in shipping large frameworks and versioning them through multiply releases and through a long period of time. I also believe that some of those frameworks are significantly larger and more complex than what the MS MVC is going to be. (Hint, if MS MVC even seems, by an illiterate drunken sailor on a rainy day, to approach NHibernate&#x27;s complexity, it is time to hit the drawing board again). And those frameworks are using frameworks to do pretty much everything. And I cannot recall off hand any breaking change that resulted from that. In some cases, where the interface is an extension point into the framework, we have gone with interface &#x2B; base class with default functionality. If you use the base class, you are guaranteed no breaking change. The reasoning for an interface is that it is giving the user more choice, you aren&#x27;t limiting the options that the user have when it comes to use this (by taking out the single inheritance slot, for example). Now, if we analyze the expected usage of IHttpContext for a moment, who is going to be affected by changing this interface? Only implementers. Who is going to implement IHttpHandler? I can think of only two scenarios. Hand rolled test fakes and extending the Http Context in some interesting ways, perhaps by adding proxies or decorators to it. In the first case, that is no something that I would worry about. The second is far rarer but also the much more interesting case, but those are generally not done by hand (I wouldn&#x27;t want to type all the methods of IHttpContext, that is for sure). Even if it was, I still have no issue with it. New framework version, add a method. It is not a significant change. A significant change would require me to rework large swathes of my application. Now, why do I care for that? The reason is very simple. It is a pain to me, personally, when I end up running into those warts. It is annoying, frustrating and aggravating. I like to be happy, because otherwise I am not happy, so I try to minimize my exposure to the afore mentioned warts. Hopefully, I can make them go away entirely. And not just by pulling the blanket over my head.</p>
