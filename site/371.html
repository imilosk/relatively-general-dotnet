            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Compression is a pretty nifty tool to have, and it can save a lot in both I/O and overall time (CPU tends to have more cycles to spare then I/O bandwidth). I decided that I wanted to investigate it more deeply.  The initial corpus was all the orders documents from the Northwind sample database. And I tested this by running GZipStream over the results.  753Kb - Without compression &#xA0; 69Kb - With compression  That is a pretty big difference between the two options. However, this is when we compress all those documents together. What happens if we want to compress each of them individually? We have 830 orders, and the result of compressing all of them individually is:  752Kb - Without compression 414Kb - With compression I did a lot of research into compression algorithms recently, and it the reason for the difference is that when we compress more data together, we can get better compression ratios. That is because compression works by removing duplication, and the more data we have, the more duplication we can find. Note that we still manage to do  What about smaller data sets? I created 10,000 records looking like this:  {&quot;id&quot;:1,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Gloria Woods&quot;,&quot;email&quot;:&quot;gwoods@meemm.gov&quot;} And gave it the same try (compressing each entry independently):  550KB &#x2013; Without compression 715KB &#x2013; With compression The overhead of compression on small values is very significant. Just to note, compressing all entries together will result in a data size of 150Kb in size. So far, I don&#x2019;t think that I&#x2019;ve any surprising revelations. That is pretty much exactly inline with my expectations. And the reason that I&#x2019;m actually playing with compression algorithms rather than just use an off the shelve one. This particular scenario is exactly where FemtoZip is supposed to help, and that is what I am looking at now. Ideally, what I want is a shared dictionary compression that allows me to manage the dictionary myself, and doesn&#x2019;t have a static dictionary that is created once, although that seems a lot more likely to be the way we&#x2019;ll go.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just got a really interesting customer inquiry, and I got their approval to share it. The basic problem is booking flights, and how to handle that. The customer suggested something like the following: {   //customers/12345&#xA;    &quot;Name&quot; : &quot;John Doe&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;Bookings&quot; : [{&#xA;        &quot;FlightId&quot;: &quot;flights/1234&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;BookingId&quot;: &quot;1asifyupi&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;Flight&quot;: &quot;EA-4814&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;From&quot;: &quot;Iceland&quot;,&#xA;        &quot;To&quot; : &quot;Japan&quot;, &#xA;        &quot;DateBooked&quot; : &quot;2012/1/1&quot;&#xA;      }]&#xA;    }    &#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;{ // flight/1234&#xA;   &quot;PlaneId&quot;: &quot;planes/1234&quot;// centralized miles flown, service history&#xA;   &quot;Seats&quot;: &#xA;   {&#xA;       {&#xA;           &quot;Seat&quot;: &quot;F16&quot;&#xA;           &quot;BookedBy&quot;: &quot;1asifyupi&quot;&#xA;   }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But that is probably a&#x2026; suboptimal way to handle this. Let us go over the type of entities that we have here:&#xA;&#xA;Customers / Passengers &#xA;Flights&#xA;Planes&#xA;Booking&#xA;The key point in here is that each of those is pretty independent. Note that for simplicity&#x2019;s sake, I&#x2019;m assuming that the customer is also the passenger (not true in many cases, a company may pay for your flight, so you the company in the customer and you the passenger).&#xA;The actual problem the customer is dealing with is that they have thousands of flights, tens or hundreds of thousands of seats and millions of customers competing for those seats.&#xA;Let us see if we can breaking it down to a model that can work for this scenario.&#xA0; Customers deserve its own document, but I wouldn&#x2019;t store the bookings directly in the customer document. There are many customers that fly a lot, and they are going to have a lot of booking there. At the same time, there are many bookings that are made for a lot of people at the same time (an entire family flying).&#xA;That leaves the Customer&#x2019;s document with data about the customer (name, email, phone, passport #, etc) as well as details such as # of miles traveled, the frequent flyer status, etc.&#xA;Now, we have the notion of flights and bookings. A flight is a (from, to, time, plane), which contains the available seats number. Note that we need to explicitly allow for over booking, since that is a common practice for airlines.&#xA;There are several places were we have contention here:&#xA;&#xA;When ordering, we want to over book up to a certain limit.&#xA;When seating (usually 24 &#x2013; 48 hours before the flight) we want to reserve seats.&#xA;The good thing about it is that we actually have a relatively small contention on a particular flight. And the way the airline industry works, we don&#x2019;t actually need a transaction between creating the booking and taking a seat on the flight.&#xA;The usual workflows goes something like this:&#xA;&#xA;A &#x201C;reservation&#x201D; is made for a particular itinerary.&#xA;That itinerary is held for 24 &#x2013; 48 hours.&#xA;That itinerary is sent to the customer for approval.&#xA;Customer approve and a booking is made, flight reservations are turned into actual booked seats.&#xA;The good thing about this is that because a flight can have up to ~600 seats in it, we don&#x2019;t really have to worry about contention on a single flight. We can just use normal optimistic concurrency and avoid more complex models. That means that we can just retry on concurrency errors and see where that leads us. The breaking of the actual order into reservation and booking also helps, since we don&#x2019;t have to coordinate between the actual charge and the reservation on the flight.&#xA;Overbooking is handled by setting a limit of how much we allow overbooking, and managing the number of booked seats vs. reserved seats. When we look at the customer data, we show the customer document, along with the most recent orders and the stats. When we look at a particular flight, we can get pretty much all of its state from the flight document itself. &#xA;And the plane&#x2019;s stats are usually just handled via a map/reduce index on all the flights for that plane. &#xA;Now, in the real world, the situation is a bit more complex. We might give out 10 economy seats and 3 business seats to Expedia for a 2 months period, so they manage that, and we have partnership agreements with other airlines, and&#x2026; but I think that this is a good foundation to start building this on.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Take a look at the following code: int count = 0;&#xA;var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();&#xA;var tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;();   &#xA;for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;{&#xA;    var t = Task.Run(() =&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        var webRequest = WebRequest.Create(new Uri(&#x201C;http://google.com&#x201D;));        webRequest.GetResponse().Close();&#xA;        Interlocked.Increment(ref count);&#xA;    });&#xA;    tasks.Add(t);&#xA;}&#xA;var whenAll = Task.WhenAll(tasks.ToArray());&#xA;while (whenAll.IsCompleted == false &amp;&amp; whenAll.IsFaulted  == false)&#xA;{&#xA;    Thread.Sleep(1000);&#xA;    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} - {1}, {2}&quot;, sp.Elapsed, count, tasks.Count(x=&gt; x.IsCompleted == false));&#xA;}&#xA;Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, it is a pretty silly example of making 500 queries to Google. There is some stuff here about reporting &amp; managing, but the key points is that we start 500 tasks to do some I/O. How long do you think that this is going to run?&#xA;On my machine, this code completes in roughly 22 seconds. Now, WebRequest is old school, and we want to use HttpClient, because it has a much better interface, so we wrote:&#xA;int count = 0;&#xA;var sp = Stopwatch.StartNew();&#xA;var tasks = new List&lt;Task&gt;();&#xA;for (int i = 0; i &lt; 500; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;{&#xA;    var t = Task.Run(() =&gt;&#xA;    {&#xA;        var client = new HttpClient();&#xA;        client.SendAsync(new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, new Uri(&quot;http://google.com&quot;))).Wait();&#xA; &#xA;        Interlocked.Increment(ref count);&#xA;    });&#xA;    tasks.Add(t);&#xA;}&#xA;var whenAll = Task.WhenAll(tasks.ToArray());&#xA;while (whenAll.IsCompleted == false &amp;&amp; whenAll.IsFaulted == false)&#xA;{&#xA;    Thread.Sleep(1000);&#xA;    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} - {1}, {2}&quot;, sp.Elapsed, count, tasks.Count(x =&gt; x.IsCompleted == false));&#xA;}&#xA;Console.WriteLine(sp.Elapsed); &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I&#x2019;ve been running this code on my machine for the past 7 minutes, and this code hasn&#x2019;t yet issue a single request.&#xA;It took a while to figure it out, but the problem is in how this is structured. We are creating a lot of tasks, more than the available threads in the thread pool. Then we make an async call, and block on that. That means that we block the thread pool thread. Which means that to process the result of this call, we&#x2019;ll need to use another thread pool thread. However, we have scheduled more tasks than we have threads for. So there is no thread available to handle the reply, so all the threads are stuck waiting for reply that there is no thread to handle to unstick them.&#xA;The thread pool notices that, and will decide to allocate more threads, but they are also taken up by the already existing tasks that will immediately block.&#xA;Now, surprisingly, eventually the thread pool will allocate enough threads (although it will take it several hours to do so, probably) to start handling the requests, and the issue is resolved. Expect that this ends up basically crippling the application while this is happening.&#xA;Obviously, the solution is to not wait on async calls inside a task like that, indeed, we can use the following code quite easily:&#xA;var t = Task.Run(async () =&gt;&#xA;{&#xA;    var client = new HttpClient();&#xA;    await client.SendAsync(new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, new Uri(&quot;http://google.com&quot;)));&#xA;&#xA;    Interlocked.Increment(ref count);&#xA;});&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And this shows performance comparable to the WebRequest method.&#xA;However, that isn&#x2019;t very helpful when we need to expose a synchronous API. In our case, in RavenDB we have the IDoctumentSession, which is a simple synchronous API. We want to use the a common codebase for sync and async operations. But we need to expose the same interface, even if we changed things. To make things worse, we have no control on how the http client is scheduling the async operations, and it has no sync operations.&#xA;That means that we are left with the choice of writing everything twice, once for synchronous operations and once for async ops or just living with this issue.&#xA;A work around we managed to find is to run the root tasks (which we do control) on our own task scheduler, so they won&#x2019;t compete with the I/O operations. But that is hardly something that I am thrilled about.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There was a question about our use of Task&lt;T&gt; and Lazy&lt;T&gt; in RavenDB, and I thought that this is a subtle thing that deserve more than a short email. The basic difference between Lazy&lt;T&gt; and Task&lt;T&gt; are the kind of contracts that they express.  Lazy&lt;T&gt; represent a potentially expensive operation that has been deferred. The promise given is that the lazy&#x2019;s value will be generated the first time that it is needed. Task&lt;T&gt; represent a potentially expensive operation that is currently executing. The promise is that the task&#x2019;s value will be available on request, hopefully already there by the time you asked. The major difference is when we are actually starting the operation. Most often, when we return a task, we return a reference to an scheduled / executing task, which will complete whatever or not the task&#x2019;s result will be accessed. Conversely, a lazy&#x2019;s whose value was never accessed is not something that will ever execute. The use cases for them tend to be quite different. Lazy&lt;T&gt; is used a lot of the time as a way to handle once and only once creation (basically, a safe singleton pattern), and for actually deferring the execution of work. Sometimes you can avoid having to do something, and it is easier to give a caller a lazy object and only have to pay for that additional work if they access the data.  Task&lt;T&gt; is primarily used to actually parallelize the work, so you&#x2019;ll have it running while you are doing other stuff. Usually this is used for I/O, since that can be natively parallelized. With RavenDB, we use Task&lt;T&gt; as the return type of all our async operations, allowing of to take advantage on the async nature of I/O. And we use Lazy&lt;T&gt; to setup a deferred call for the server. When someone actually access one of lazy&#x2019;s values, we have to provide you with the answer. At this point, we can go to the server with all&#xA0; the pending lazy operations, and save a lot of effort just making remote calls to the server. In fact, in RavenDB 3.0, we have lazy support in the async API. That means that we have methods that return Lazy&lt;Task&lt;T&gt;&gt;, which means: Give me a deferred operation, that when required, will perform in an async manner. That gives me both the ability to combine requests to the server and avoid blocking up a thread while that I/O is in progress.</p>

This is especially the case when we are talking about moving existing projects to RavenDB, rather than doing green field development. Recently we have seen quite a bit of a surge in customers coming to us for assistance in that area. As a result of that, I would like to announce that we are now offering those services as a core part of our offering. If you have an existing application and you want to move all or part of it to RavenDB, we now have completed training for staff to help you do just that. This can be just a standalone  In addition to that, because this is a new service, we are actually going to offer the first three new customers this service for free (contact support@ravendb.net for this). We want to encourage people to use RavenDB, and I think that one of the key things we can do to help is reduce any barriers to entry, and this one is pretty big.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that tend to get lost is the fact that Hibernating Rhinos is doing more than just working on RavenDB. The tagline we like to use is Easier Data, and the main goal we have is to provide users with better ways to access, monitor and manage their data. We have started planning the next version of the Uber Profiler, that means Entity Framework Profiler, NHibernate Profiler, etc. Obviously, we&#x2019;ll offer support for EF 7.0 and NHibernate 4.0, and we had gathered quite a big dataset for common errors when using an OR/M, which we intend to convert into useful guidance whenever our users run into such an issue.  But I realized that I was so busy working on RavenDB that I forgot to even mention the work we&#x2019;ve been doing elsewhere. And I also wanted to solicit feedback about the kind of features you&#x2019;ll want to see in the 3.0 version of the profilers.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m pretty bad when it comes to actually organizing my blog. I just like to write stuff out, I don&#x2019;t like to do things like properly setting things up in series. Mostly because I usually think about one post at a time, or three at the most. I did notice that I usually use something like &#x201C;Series name: post name&#x201D; convention when writing series of posts. So I decided to write the following index to check the data out:  As you can see, this is pretty simple way of doing things. And that lead to the following data.  Some of those are obviously false positives, and we have things like this, which are obviously out:  But it looks like important series are also spread over time:  I think that I&#x2019;m going to have to do a new blog feature, to highlight those emergent series.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that we have to deal with as a replicated database is how to handle failure. In RavenDB, we have dealt with that with replication, automatic failover and a smart backoff strategy that combined reducing the impact on the clients when a node was down with being able to detect that it was up quickly. In RavenDB 3.0, we have improved on that. Before, we would ping the failed server every now and then, to check if it is up. However, that would mean that routine operations would slow down, even when the failover server was working. In order to handle this, we used to have a backoff strategy for checking the failed server. We would only check it once every 10th request, until we have 10 failed requests, then we would check it only once every 100th request, until we had a 100 failed requests, etc. That worked quite well. Mostly because a lot of the time, failures are transients, and you don&#x2019;t want to fail to a secondary for too long, and if we had a long standing issue, we had a small hiccup, and then everything worked fine, with the occasional hold on a request while we checked things. In addition to that, we also have gossip mechanism that would inform clients that their server is up so they can figure out that the primary server is up even faster.  Anyway, that is what we used to do. In RavenDB 3.0, we have moved to using an async pinging approach. When we detect that the server is down, we will still do the checks as before, but unlike 2.x, we won&#x2019;t do them in the current execution thread, instead, we have a background task that will ping the server to see if it is up. That means that after the first failed request, we will immediately switch over to the secondary, and we will keep on the secondary until the background ping process will report that everything is up. That means that for a very short failure (less than 1 second, usually) we will switch over to the secondary, where before we&#x2019;ll be able to figure out that the server is still up. But the upside here is that we won&#x2019;t have any interruption in service just to check that the primary is up.</p>
