            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I took a bit of time to work on Rhino Mocks today, mainly cleaning&#xA;up some stuff and rearranging things. It occur to me that after getting&#xA;so excited about Rhino&#x27;s tests earlier today, I might check the code&#xA;coverage reports*.  The first report that I got was quite&#xA;disappointing, I had only 57% coverage. I had such high hope and they&#xA;were thoroughfully dahsed. Then I remembered that I used CodeSmith to&#xA;generate custom collections for Rhino. NCover doesn&#x27;t allow you to&#xA;exclude namespaces, which made it impossible to see the code coverage&#xA;excluding this annoying code generated files. I wrote&#xA0;quick &amp;&#xA;dirty script in Boo&#xA0;that cleaned the report from those annoying classes and then I run the reports again.     I fell of my chair. I had 93%!&#xA;Just to put these things in order, I currenly have about 40% coverage&#xA;for NQA**. There are three reasons for using code coverage:             Your ego needs a boost :-)         &#xA;You want to track TDD&#x27;s usage in your code, if you suddenly see the&#xA;precentage dives, you know that you need to find the responsible party&#xA;and commence in re-educating them.             You want to check for possible dead code / dead code paths.     &#xA;The first thing that I noticed when doing this is that I actually had&#xA;two custom collection classes that I actually weren&#x27;t using, there went&#xA;3,500 LoC that I don&#x27;t want to see again. Then i gotten into the code&#xA;and found some surprising results, I&#x27;d places where there was code&#xA;rotting. It was mainly a case where I was handling certain condition&#xA;via a higher level method while the lower level methods were prepared&#xA;to handle it themself (which of course never happened). I filled all&#xA;the missing remaining holes (error handling in contraints was a big&#xA;thing that I mostly missed) and then I took the time to look at the&#xA;rest of the collection classes.  They were huge classes that&#xA;were quite capable, but I only used one or two methods of the doezens&#xA;that they had. Considerring that, I chopped them off and built my own&#xA;strongly typed wrappers around Hashtable and ArrayList reducing the&#xA;total lines of code by another ~5,500(!) LoC.&#xA0; This also means&#xA;that I now have 100% test coverage over my entire codebase.     So there is another release, 2.3.4,&#xA;which is smaller by 50Kb than the previous one, with no loss of&#xA;functionality or changing the API. One bug fix that I made was to throw&#xA;an exception if you pass a null as a parameter for Constraints(), which&#xA;is something that I ignored previously.             *I&#x27;m using NCover, it&#x27;s good and unintrusive, but it can be a pain to setup for the first time.                 ** Of course, now I&#x27;ll get comments saying that it&#x27;s 93% that is low.         &#xA0;Just to note:&#xA;100% test coverage doesn&#x27;t really means much in terms of code&#xA;correctness. You can very easily get to 100% code coverage and still&#xA;have gaping holes in your software. Take handling nulls, for instance.&#xA;If you aren&#x27;t handling them, you could very well get a 100% code&#xA;coverage and still get NullReferenceException in production because you&#xA;just don&#x27;t have the code path to verify that.</p>

The bug is fixed (and I was very excited about it, apperantly).    The new version can be found here&#xA0;and the source is in the repository.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So I&#x27;m sitting by the computer reading something and suddenly the new email sound startles and the&#xA0;Bugs folder in Outlook light up. This usually don&#x27;t happen unless I enter a bug into my bug tracking system, so naturally I was curious about the nature of the bug&#xA0;and the person who entered it. I still don&#x27;t know who entered the bug (a very annoying problem in Flyspary, you seem to have to register to enter bug non anonymously) but the bug was a masterpiece.     It had a clear explanation of the problem as well as code the demonstrated it. This was invaluable in finding out the cause. If you&#x27;ll check the time stamps, the bug was entered in 06:29Am, I managed to reproduce it four minutes later. And that includes the time to open VS.Net! Five minutes afterward I knew what the problem was and was able to think of a fix for this.    The first thing i thought when I looked at the problem was that the problem was that the class was [Serializable], but it took just one look at the failure to see that i was heading in the wrong direction and to find the cause of the problem. The problem was that the class was overriding GetHashCode() &amp; Equals() and that was when all hell broke loose. In order to manage the mock objects, Rhino Mocks store them inside a hash table (custom collection, but that is minor detail). When you&#x27;re storing an object in a hash table the hash table uses the GetHashCode() &amp; Equals() quite extensively in order to put it in its place.    Unfortunately, this cause huge slight problem with Rhino Mocks, since any call on a mocked object goes to the MockRepository where the object&#x27;s state is looked up in the hash table and then executed. Obviously, if the hash table itself is calling methods and each method cause a hashtable seek, which call methods, which... You get the idea.    Microsoft thought about it when they built the hash table and they provide an interface you can implement that would allow you to get the hash code of an object externally. Just pass an IHashCodeProvider&#xA0;to the Hashtable constructor and you&#x27;re set. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see any way to implement this for Rhino Mocks without using the object&#x27;s GetHashCode() since I wanted a (relatively) unique number that would be consistent across the call&#x27;s invocations. Since I couldn&#x27;t see a way to do so, I just work around it by special casing Object&#x27;s method and passing them without the usual checks. This worked in my tests and in the code that I was using, so I didn&#x27;t give it any more thought. It wasn&#x27;t the best solution, but that was the best solution that I could think of.    Let a couple of months pass and enter this bug. Suddenly it became imperative to find a way around this limitation, after all, how lame is it to have a mocking framework that doesn&#x27;t allow you to overriding Equals() or GetHashCode()? I spent around 15 minutes thinking up and then coding a hash code provider that wouldn&#x27;t need the object&#x27;s state. The secret is that I&#x27;m already tagging each mock object with a special interface (IProxy is previous versions, IMockedObject now) which is used to locate the mock object&#x27;s repository.     I simply added a Guid to the this interface and built a HashCodeProvider and Comparer that accepted a mock object and acted upon the Guid. I used a Guid because that is guaranteed to be unique and allow me to easily distinguish between the mock objects. I could&#x27;ve used the interface itself for that, but that wouldn&#x27;t have given me an easy way to tell apart mocked objects and integers, which were the other option, suffer from thread safety problems.As I was writing the above it occurred to me that I&#x27;m being stupid here. Why create a 128 bit object just to have a unique 32 bit number, not to mention that creating (&amp; comparing) a Guid is quite expensive. I just changed it to use an integer and my tests&#x27; timing dropped from 7 seconds to 3.5 seconds. I used Interlocked.Increment() to ensure that each mock object will have a unique hash code, even though this is not really required.     Anyway, I made the change and run the tests (only 92/272 broken tests :-) )and got the scary ExecutionEngineException. To cut a long story short, I made some assumptions about classes that didn&#x27;t hold true for interfaces. I must say that I&#x27;m very impressed with DynamicProxy&#xA0;and the things that it allows me to do (re-route a call midway is quite impressive, for instance). I understand that this is a standard feature in Java and I think that it should&#x27;ve been in .Net as well. Remoting proxies are... not really proxies. (I just found out how to lie about the object&#x27;s type, I can&#x27;t think of any use case for that, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I can :-) )    To be short (a hopeless cause now), it took less than two hours to change a fundamental part of the way Rhino Mocks is managing mock objects. I&#x27;m releasing the new version with confidence that it will work as expected. I just can&#x27;t imagine how bad it would be if I had to do it testless.    There are two changes that you should be aware of:            You cannot set expectation on System.Object&#x27;s method without overriding them in your class.            The default ToString() value now match the default behavior of the system and will no longer return null.    Just a sentence about the version number, version 2.3 is actually 2.3.2054.etc, which I only found out about after releasing 2.3.1.etc which means that the more recent version is considered to be older than the older one which necessitated jumping over 2.3.2.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;ve used Natural Docs to generate some initial documentation for Rhino Mocks&#x2019; API, which is available at:                    Rhino Mocks API                &#xA0;        There&#xA;is one nasty bug that I found by reading the code, which is that Rhino&#xA;Mocks doesn&#x2019;t verify the expectations if you&#x2019;ve set a method to throw&#xA;an exception.        I fixed that bug (it was there to make it easier to see why Rhino fails, but it&#x2019;s pretty solid now).        I also changed the MockRepository.Dispose() to explicit interface implementation.        Just call to VerifyAll() if you&#x2019;re using it, it&#x2019;s one and the same.            &#xA0;        Beyond that, there are some minor refactoring to the internals, which shouldn&#x2019;t affect anyone.                    &#xA0;    Downloads at the usual place.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If there is such a thing as resting your mind while working, it&#x27;s what I have when I&#x27;m working on Rhino Mocks. I&#x27;ve just finished implementing things I talked about here, it was no small thing to do, as it changes some fundamental assumptions about way Rhino Mocks works.    Nevertheless, the actual coding was a breeze. I simply added several overloads, wrote some tests to verify that it worked and it worked. Then I wrote some edge cases tests and fixed the problems. I&#x27;d to move some basic functionality from one spot to the other (too keep with DRY principal) and I was able to do that with the certainty that I would know if I would break something. In fact, I did broke the tests a couple of time, which made me happy since the error was caught so easily. Test Driven Development rocks!    The new features are:            Dynamic mocks - (what I called Relaxed mocks in the previous posts) mock objects that verify any expectation that was explicitly setup and allows any unexpected methods to succeed silently. (It&#x27;s accessible via mocks.DynamicMock(), I&#x27;ll update the documentation later today.&#xA0;)            Added the Never() call the IRepeat interface - this has the same semantics of the Any() call (ignore ordering, etc) for use with Dynamic mocks (it&#x27;s the equivalent of ExpectNoCall() in NMock)    The bug fixes include:            Allows to mix &amp; match calls to Replay() &amp; Verify() with ReplayAll() and VerifyAll()            A new IMockSate - VerifiedMockState that simply gives better error message if you&#x27;re trying to use a verified object.    BTW, about the version numbers:    I&#x27;m going to update the minor version number every time I&#x27;ll release a significant feature. I&#x27;ll update the build number each time I&#x27;m doing&#xA0;a bug fix release. The revision number is the default .Net one right now. The recent flood in releases was caused by feedback (keep it coming) and suggestions from users which incrementally makes the framework better.</p>
