            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Matthew Bonig asks, with regards to a bug in RavenDB MVC Integration (RavenDB Profiler) that caused major slow down on this blog.:  I&#x27;d be very curious to know how this code got published to a production environment without getting caught. I would have thought this problem would have occurred in any testing environment as well as it did here. Ayende, can you comment on where the process broke down and how such an obvious bug was able to slip through? Well, the answer for that comes in two parts. The first part&#xA0; is that no process broke down. We use our own assets for final testing of all our software, that means that whenever there is a stable RavenDB release pending (and sometimes just when we feel like it) we move our infrastructure to the latest and greatest. Why?  Because as hard as you try testing, you will never be able to catch everything. Production is the final test ground, and we have obvious incentives of trying to make sure that everything works.&#xA0; It is dogfooding, basically. Except that if we get a lemon, that is a very public one. It means that whenever we make a stable release, we can do that with high degree of confidence that everything is going to work, not just because all the tests are passing, but because our production systems had days to actually see if things are right. The second part of this answer is that this is neither an obvious bug nor one that is easy to catch. Put simply, things worked. There wasn&#x2019;t even an infinite loop that would make it obvious that something is wrong, it is just that there was a lot of network traffic that you would notice only if you either had a tracer running, or were trying to figure out why the browser was suddenly so busy. Here is a challenge, try to devise some form of an automated test that would catch something like this error, but do so without actually testing for this specific issue. After all, it is unlikely that someone would have written a test for this unless they run into the error in the first place. So I would be really interested in seeing what sort of automated approaches would have caught that.</p>

Obviously we were doing something very wrong there, but what exactly was it? We tracked down the problem to the following code:   As you can probably guess, the problem is that we have what is effective an infinite loop. On any Ajax request, we will generate a new Ajax request. And that applies to our own requests as well. The fix was pretty obvious when we figured out what was going on, but until then&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a review of the Northwind Starter Kit project, this review revision 94815 from Dec 18 2011.  A while ago I said:   Seriously?!&#xA0; 22(!) projects to do a sample application using Northwind? And people took me up to task about it. The criticism was mostly focused on two parts:   I didn&#x2019;t get that the project wasn&#x2019;t about Northwind, but about being a sample app for architectural design patterns.  I couldn&#x2019;t actually decide that a project was bad simply by looking at the project structure and some minor code browsing. I am sad to say that after taking a detailed look at the code, I am even more firmly back at my original conclusion.&#xA0; I started to do a review of the UI code, but there really is no real need to do so. The entire project, as I said in the beginning, is supposed to be a sample application for Northwind. Northwind is a CRUD application. Well, not exactly, it is supposed to be an example of an Online Store, which is something much bigger than just Northwind. But it isn&#x2019;t.  Say what you will, the Northwind Starter Kit is a CRUD application. It does exactly that, and nothing else. It does so in an incredibly complicated fashion, mind, but that is what it does. Well, it doesn&#x2019;t do updates, or deletes, or creates. So it is just an R application (I certainly consider the codebase to be R rated, not for impressionable developers). If you want to have a sample application to show off architectural ideas, make sure that the application can actually, you know, show them. The only thing that NSK does is loading stuff from the database, try as I might, I found no real piece of business logic, no any reason why it is so complicated. So, to the guys who commented on that, it isn&#x2019;t a good project. If you like it, I am happy for you, there are also people who loves this guy:  Personally, I would call pest control.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">With regards to my quests against repositories, Matt asks:  &#x2026;if my aggregate root query should exclude entities that have, for example, and IsActive = false flag, I also don&#x27;t want to repeatedly exclude the IsActive = false entities. Using the repository pattern I can expose my Get method where internally it ALWAYS does this. The problem with this question is that it make a false assumption, then go ahead and follow on that false assumption. The false assumption here is that the only way to handle the IsActive = false in by directly querying that. But that is wrong. With NHibernate, you can define that with a where condition, or as a filter. With RavenDB, you can define that inside a query listener. You can absolutely set those things up as part of your infrastructure, and you won&#x2019;t need to create any abstractions for that.</p>

It is obvious from reading the code that there was some attention given to CQRS. Unfortunately, I can&#x2019;t really figure out what for. To start with, both the Read Model and the Domain Model are actually sitting on the same physical location. If you are doing that, there is a 95% chance that you don&#x2019;t need CQRS. If you have that, you are going to waste a lot of time and effort and are very unlikely to get anything from it.  In the case of NSK, here is the domain model vs. the read model for the customer.   I marked the difference. I am sorry, there is nothing that justify a different model here. Just needless complexity. Remember, our job is to make things simpler, not make it hard to work with the application.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a review of the Northwind Starter Kit project, this review revision 94815 from Dec 18 2011.  Okay, enough about the data access parts. Let us see take a look at a few of the other things that are going on in the application. In particular, this is supposed to be an application with&#x2026;   Domain logic is implemented by means of a Domain Model, onto a layer of services adds application logic. The model is persisted by a DAL designed around the principles of the &quot;Repository&quot; patterns, which has been implemented in a LINQ-friendly way. Let us try to figure this out one at a time, okay?  The only method in the domain model that have even a hint of domain logic is the CalculateTotalIncome method. Yes, you got it right, that is a method, as in singular. And that method should be replaced with a query, it has no business being on the domain model. So let us move to the services, okay? Here are the service definitions in the entire project:  Look at the methods carefully. Do you see any action at all? You don&#x2019;t, the entire thing is just about queries.  And queries should be simple, not abstracted away and made very hard to figure out. The rule of the thumb is that you try hard to not abstract queries, it is operations that you try to abstract. Operations is where you usually actually find the business logic.</p>
