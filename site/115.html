            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A couple of days, a fire started in OVH&#x2019;s datacenter. You can read more about this here:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;They use slightly different terminology, but translating that to the AWS terminology, an entire &quot;region&#x201D; is down, with SGB1-4 being &#x201C;availability zones&#x201D; in the region.&#xA;For reference, there are some videos from the location that make me very sad. This is what it looked like under active fire:&#xA;&#xA;I&#x2019;m going to assume that this is a total loss of everything that was in there.&#xA;RavenDB Cloud isn&#x2019;t offering any services in any OVH data centers, but this is a good time to go over the Disaster Recovery Plan for RavenDB and RavenDB Cloud. It is worth noting that the entire data center has been hit, with the equivalent to an entire AWS region going down.&#xA;&#xA;I&#x2019;m not sure that this is a fair comparison, it doesn&#x2019;t looks like that SBG 1-4 are exactly the same thing as AWS availability, but it is close enough to draw parallels.&#xA;&#xA;So far, at least, there have been no cases where Amazon has lost an entire region. There were occasions were a whole availability zone was down, but never a complete region. The way Amazon is handling Availability Zones seems to most paranoid, with each availability zone distanced &#x201C;many kilometers&#x201D; from each other in the same region. Contrast that with the four SGB that all went down. For Azure, on the other hand, they explicitly call out the fact that availability zones may not provide sufficient cover for DR scenarios. Google Cloud Platform also provides no information on the matter. For that matter, we also have direct criticism on the topic from AWS.&#xA;Yesterday, on the other hand, Oracle Cloud had a DNS configuration error that took effectively the entire cloud down.&#xA0; The good news is that this is just inability to access the cloud, not actual loss of a region, as was the case on OVH. However, when doing Disaster Recovery Planning, having the the entire cloud drop off the face of the earth is also something that you have to consider.&#xA;With that background out of the way, let&#x2019;s consider the impact of losing two availability zones inside AWS, losing a entire region in Azure or GCP or even losing an entire cloud platform. What would be the impact on a RavenDB cluster running in that scenario?&#xA;RavenDB is designed to be resilient. Using RavenDB Cloud, we make sure that each of the nodes in the cluster is running on a separate availability zone. If we lose two zones in a region, there is still a single RavenDB instance that can operate. Note that in this case, we won&#x2019;t have a quorum. That means that certain operations won&#x2019;t be available (you won&#x2019;t be able to create new databases, for example) but read and write operations will work normally and your application will fail over silently to the remaining server. When the remaining servers recover, RavenDB will update them with all the missing data that was modified while they were down.&#xA;The situation with OVH is actually worse than that. In this case, a datacenter is gone. In other words, these nodes aren&#x2019;t coming back. RavenDB will allow you to perform emergency operations to remove the missing nodes and rebuilt the cluster from the single surviving node.&#xA;What about the scenario where the entire region is gone? In this case, if there are no more servers for RavenDB to run on, it is going to be down. That is the time to enact the Disaster Recovery Plan. In this case, it means deploying a new RavenDB Cluster to a new region and restoring from backup.&#xA;RavenDB Cloud ensures full daily backups as well as hourly incremental backups for all databases, so the amount of data loss will be minimal. That said, where are the backups located?&#xA;By default, RavenDB stores the backups in S3, in the same region as the cluster itself. Amazon S3 has the best durability guarantees in the market. This is beyond just the number of nines that they provide in terms of data durability. A standard S3 object is going to be residing in three separate availability zones. As mentioned, for AWS, we have guarantees about distance between those availability zones that we haven&#x2019;t seen from other cloud providers. For that reason, when your cluster reside in AWS, we&#x2019;ll store the backups on S3 in the same region. For Azure and GCP, on the other hand, we&#x2019;ll also use AWS S3 for backup storage. For a whole host of reasons, we select a nearby region. So a cluster on Azure US East would store its backups on AWS S3 on US-East-1, for example. And a cluster on Azure in the Netherlands will store its backups on AWS S3 on the Frankfurt region. In addition to all other safeguards, the backups are encrypted, naturally.&#xA;The cloud has been around for 15 years already (amazing, I know) and so far, AWS has had a great history with not suffering catastrophic failures like the one that OVH has run into. Then again, until last week, you could say the same about OVH, but with 20&#x2B; years of operations. Part of the Disaster Recovery Process is knowing what risks are you willing to accept. And the purpose of this post is to expand on what we do and how we plan to react to such scenarios, be they ever so unlikely.&#xA;RavenDB actually has a number of features that are applicable for handling these sorts of scenarios. They aren&#x2019;t enabled in the cloud by default, but they are important to discuss for users who need to have business continuity.&#xA;&#xA;Multi-region or Multi-cloud clusters are available. You can setup RavenDB across multiple disparate location in several manners, but the end result is that you can ensure that you have no single point of failure, while still using RavenDB to its fullest potential. This is commonly used in large applications that are naturally geo distributed, but it also serve as a way to not put all your eggs in a single basket.&#xA;In addition to the default backup strategy (same AWS region on AWS or nearby AWS region for Azure or GCP), you can setup backups to additional regions.&#xA;&#xA;One of the key aspects of business continuity is the issue of the speed in which you can go back to normal operations. If you are running a large database, just the time to restore from backup can be a significant amount of time. If you have a database (or databases) whose backup are in the hundreds of GB range, just the time it takes to get the backups can be measures in many hours, leaving aside the restore costs.&#xA;For that reason, RavenDB also support the notion of an offsite observer. That can be a single isolated node or a whole cluster. We can take advantage of the fact that the observer is not in active use and under provision it, in that case, when we need to switch over, we can quickly allocate additional resources to it to ramp it up to production grade. For example, let&#x2019;s assume that we have a cluster running in Azure Northern Europe region, composed of 3 nodes with 8 cores each. We also have setup an observer cluster in Azure Norway East region. Instead of having to allocate a cluster of 3 nodes with 8 cores each, we can allocate a much smaller size, say 2 cores only (paying less than a third of the original cluster cost as a premium). In the case of disaster, we can respond quickly and within a matter of minutes, the Norway East cluster will be expanded so each of the nodes will have 8 cores and can handle full production traffic.&#xA;Naturally, RavenDB is likely to be only a part of your strategy. There is a lot more to ensuring that your users won&#x2019;t notice that something is happening while your datacenter is on fire, but at least as it relates to your database, you know that you are in good hands.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I ask candidates to answer the following question. Sometimes at home, sometimes during an interview with a whiteboard. You need to create an executable that would manage a phone book. The commands you need to support are:phone-book.exe /path/to/file add [name] [phone]phone-book.exe /path/to/file list [skip], [limit]The output of the list operation must be the phone book records in lexical order. You may not sort the data during the list operation, however. All such work must be done in the add operation.You may keep any state you&#x2019;ll like in the file system, but there are separate invocations of the program for each step.&#xA0; This program need to support adding 10 million records. Feel free to constrain the problem in any other way that would make it easier for you to implement it. We&#x2019;ll rate the solution on how much it cost in terms of I/O. A reminder, we are a database company, this sort of question is incredibly relevant to the things that we do daily.I give this question to candidates with no experience, fresh graduates,&#xA0; etc. How would you rate its difficulty?</p>

At the time, I was using ADO.Net and the XmlDocument. The idea is the same, however, and it will spare you going through a mass of really uninteresting details.I got so many challenges to this answer,though. I relied on null being sorted first on SQL Server and then on the fact that a parent must exist before its children. Aside from these assumptions, which I feel are fairly safe to make, I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what the big deal was.Eventually it turned out that the interviewers were trying to guide me toward a recursive solution. It never even occurred to me, since I was doing that with a single query and a recursive solution would need many such queries.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently got my hands on a the Raspberry PI 400 (the one that comes in a keyboard form). That is an amazing idea and it make the Raspberry a lot more approachable for consumer cases. At any rate, one of my first actions was to put RavenDB on it and see how well it performs. You can see the results in the image below. In this case, we are running 1,500 queries per second on the system. It has 4 GB of RAM and the database we are using has 450 GB (!) worth of data. I actually just took the nearest external disk I had available and plugged that into the PI. This is a generic hard disk and I can get a maximum of about 30 MB / sec from it.This is important because my queries are covering more data than can fit in memory. Each query asks for a random (different) document, so there is little chance for optimizations by having a hot working set. We are going to see some I/O to the (pretty poor) disk impacting the outcome. Here are the results:You can see that the for 95% of the queries, we got a result in under 125 milliseconds and that for 99% of the requests, RavenDB on a Raspberry PI is able to answer in about half a second.&#xA0; And even with some of the requests having to hit the disk, the maximum number of time to wait for a request is just above a second. All of that when we are facing 1,500 queries per second, which is respectable even for big applications running on much more massive hardware.Of particular interest to me is the state of the server when we are running this benchmark. You can see that both in terms of CPU utilization and in the number of queries processed, we are nearly absolutely flat. There aren&#x2019;t any hiccups in the load, there haven&#x2019;t been a GC pause that stopped the world and the system just runs at top speed for as long as we&#x2019;ll let it. In this case, the benchmark lasted over 5 minutes, so more than enough time to run through all the usual suspects. Note also the number of documents involved here. We are looking at 882 million documents. And we are requesting close to half a million of them. I run the benchmark long enough to ensure that we will cover more documents than can be fit into memory, so we are seeing I/O work here (on a fairly poor disk, I might add, but that is what I had available at the moment).The actual size of disk is a bit of a cheat, I&#x2019;m using documents compression here to pack the data more tightly. The actual data size, without using RavenDB data compression is around 750GB. That also helps a lot with the amount of I/O we have to deal with, but it increase the CPU consumption. Given the difference in relative costs, that is a task that is paying dividends in spades.I also decided to see what we can look at when we are running a query that touches just a small part of the documents. Instead of working through nearly half a million, I chose to run it on about 100,000 documents. That is small enough that it should mostly all fit in memory. It also represent a far more likely scenario, to be frank. And here we can see that we get all requests, under 1,500 queries per second on a Raspberry PI in under 150 ms, with the 99.999% (!!) percentile in about 50 milliseconds.And that makes me very happy, because it shows the result of all the work we put into optimizing RavenDB.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Following a phone screen, we typically ask candidates to complete some coding tasks. The idea is that we want to see their code and asking a candidate to program during an interview&#x2026; does not go well. I had a candidate some years ago that was provided with a machine, IDE and internet connection and walked out after failing for 30 minutes to reverse a string. Given that his CV said that he has 8 years of experience, I consider myself very lucky.Back to the candidate that prompt this post. He sent us answers to the coding tasks. In Node.JS and C&#x2B;&#x2B;. Okay, weird flex, but I can manage. I don&#x2019;t actually care what language a candidate knows, especially for the junior positions. Given that we are hiring for junior positions, we&#x2019;ll usually get solutions that bend the question restrictions. For example, they would do a linear scan of a file even when they were asked not to. For the most part, we can ignore those details and focus on what the candidate is showing us. Sometimes we ask them to fix a particular issue, but usually we&#x2019;ll just get them to the interview and ask them about their code there. I like asking candidates about their code, because I presume that they spent some time thinking about it and can discuss the topic in some detail. At one memorable interview I had a candidate tell me: &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t write this code, I have no idea what is going on here&#x201D;. I had triple checked that this is indeed the code they sent and followed up by sending the candidate home, sans offer. We can usually talk with the candidate about what drove them to certain decisions, what impact a particular constraint would be on their code, etc.In this case, however, the code was bad enough that I called it. I sent the candidate a notification about the issues we found in their code, detailing the 20&#x2B; critical failures that we found in the space of a few minutes of looking at it. The breaking point for me was that the tasks did not actually work. In fact, they couldn&#x2019;t work. I&#x2019;m not sure if they compiled, I didn&#x2019;t check, but they certain were never even eyeballed.For example, we asked the candidate to build a server that would translate messages to Morse code and cause the server speaker to beep in Morse code. Nothing particularly fancy, I think. But we got a particular implementation for that. For example, here is the relevant code that plays the Morse code:The Node.js version that I&#x2019;m using doesn&#x2019;t come with the relevant machine learning model to make that actually happen, I&#x2019;m afraid. The real killer for me was this part:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

They pass a variable to a function, set it to a new value and expect to see that new value outside. Basically, they wanted to use an out parameter here, which isn&#x2019;t valid in JavaScript. That is the kind of fairly fundamental issue in understanding the flow of code in a program. And that is something that would never have worked. I&#x2019;m okay with getting sub optimal solutions, I&#x2019;m not fine with it never have been actually looked at.</p>
