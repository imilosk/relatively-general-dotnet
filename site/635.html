            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am now discussing what sort of reports we want to give the DBA from the NHibernate Profiler. My first thought was just to give the DBA a list of the statements that the application has executed and the number of times they were repeated.&#xA0; That should allow him to get enough information to use his own tools to optimize the application physical data structure.&#xA;What do you think? Is this a good scenario?&#xA;What other scenarios can you see for NH Prof in the hands of the DBA?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the nicest features that NH Prof has to offer is this, allowing you to go from the query issued to the database directly to the line of code that caused this query to be generated. &#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;A few days ago I posted that you can either build something in one day, or in three months, but nothing much in the middle. The proof of concept that convinced me that I can build NH Prof was written during a single evening, along with two pints of Guinness. The overall concept that I have now is drastically different, but it is that evening that made sure that I would start it.&#xA;However, I wanted to use this opportunity to talk about some of the things that take a one day project and stretch it into three months. In this case, the query to line of code is a good feature, because it looks simple. After all, the only thing that I need to do, basically, is just to use the built in facility to get the stack trace, and extrapolate from there. Well, even for the normal case, that is not so easy. There are issues of user experience that play a deciding role in how we are going to deal with this.&#xA;But this isn&#x27;t what was really challenging. The challenging part came from the law of least surprises. That is, if I am providing a stack trace for queries, I should provide them for all queries. As it turned out, there was one scenario in which I am not able to give a complete stack trace. When we are mixing queries generated as a result of a lazy proxy being instantiated. On the whole, this is a minor concern, but it really bugged me. You would get a stack trace that just ended in some weird type that you never seen before.&#xA;At that point, I felt like I had to solve this. &#xA;Let us go back and outline the problem. Stack traces relies on PDBs to do their work. NHibernate&#x27;s lazy proxies are generated at runtime, have no PDBs and mask the actual call to the method / property that we are actually are interested in. The mix of the two wasn&#x27;t encouraging, I must say.&#xA;Given that, I decided to pull out the big guns, and started messing with the PDB myself. Obviously, I don&#x27;t want to do it on my own, that is why Cecil is so useful. But it was still a bit tricky to get it right. And the funny part is that I am pretty certain that this is one feature that absolutely no one will actually notice. If it wasn&#x27;t there, however, people would notice.&#xA;Anyway, it 3:30 AM here, and for some reason I managed to do more work tonight than in the previous week(!). NH Prof is now in private beta, and I hope to be able to take it to public beta in a few weeks.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note, I am currently writing the NH Prof documentation, so you are probably going to get quite a bit of NHibernate tidbits over the next few days. I want to show the user all the comments from all the posts, so they can delete all the nasty comments. The na&#x5DF;ve implementation would be something like:foreach (Post post in session.CreateQuery(&quot;from Post&quot;).List()) // SELECT * FROM Posts&#xA;{&#xA;    foreach (Comment comment in post.Comments) //lazy loading of comments list causes: SELECT * FROM Comments where PostId = @p0&#xA;    {&#xA;        //print comment...&#xA;    }&#xA;}In this example, we can see that we are loading a list of posts ( the first select ) and then traversing the object graph. However, we access the lazily loaded collection, causing NHibernate to go to the database and bring the results one row at a time. This is incredibly inefficient, and the NHibernate Profiler will generate a warning whenever it encounters such a case.The solution for this example is simple, we simple force an eager load of the collection up front.Using HQL:var  posts = session.CreateQuery(&quot;from Post p left join fetch p.Comments&quot;).List();Using the criteria API:session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Post))&#xA;    .SetFetchMode(&quot;Comments&quot;, FetchMode.Eager)&#xA;    .List();In both cases, we will get a join and only a single query to the database.Note, this is the classic appearance of the problem, it can also surface in other scenarios, such as calling the database in a loop, or more complex object graph traversals. In those cases, it it generally much harder to see what is causing the issue.NHibernate Profiler will detect those scenarios as well, and give you the exact line in the source code that cause this SQL to be generated.Another option for solving this issue is: MutliQuery and MultiCriteria, which are also used to solved the issue of Too Many Queries.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run across this post, which I found interesting:  If someone give me a set of classes that doesn&#x27;t bring a A to Z solution to a problem, sorry but I don&#x27;t call it a Framework ... I call it a Base Class Library. I&#x27;ve been very supportive to the Entity Framework Team (I gave design feedback through multiple channels) but now I think I&#x27;m done. This resonate very well with what Udi Dahan has said as a comment to Frans&#x27; post.  Microsoft is a platform company. They build technologies that partners can build stuff on top of.  It&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve always done. It&#x27;s what they&#x27;re continuing to do. Unfortunately, many developers in the Microsoft community don&#x27;t know/understand this, thinking that these technologies are supposed to be used to build applications directly. This often causes overly complex codebases. The EF&#x27;s team&#x27;s decision is consistent with providing a platform for partners to build their own ORMs on. That being said, I don&#x27;t care very much for a platform - just as I wouldn&#x27;t drive the chassis of a car.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If I knew the answer, I would bottle it and would be rich. (insert mad laugher)&#xA;Lacking a bullet proof answer, the following are my observations regarding this issue. A while ago I was the chief interviewer in my company, and I have had the chance to interview literally hundreds of people. My own conclusions match Joel from 2005. The good people are already employed elsewhere, and are likely to be happy there. If they aren&#x27;t happy, they tend to have the connections to find a job based on their known skills and experience.&#xA;In other words, unless something like the bubble burst has happened, you aren&#x27;t going to find the good people in your interviews. This means that you have to look elsewhere for that.&#xA;I know that this isn&#x27;t widely applicable, but I am using this blog as a good way of finding good people. The audience who reads this blog is already highly self selecting, and likely to share the same conceptions as I do about many things. I had several client engagements that resulted from this blog, and the environment I was working with was significantly higher than the industry average.&#xA;From the other side, the one thing that I am absolutely against is the &quot;get a new job, close the blog&quot; mentality. I wanted to point out couple of friends who did that, but I just checked, and both of them are blogging, which I somehow missed :-(&#xA;Anyway, what I am trying to say is that online presence matters. I have several friends who never had a blog, and wouldn&#x27;t consider opening one. The direct implication is that some of the smartest people I have worked with are only known through word of mouth. Real story, I was at a client site one, and was half way listening to a hallway conversation, waiting for a conference call, and I heard the following: &quot;Did you hear how Muhammad* saved [big cellular provider]&#x27;s when their [not important now]&quot;.&#xA;Some people has taken my suggestion to heart, and opened a blog. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what they are talking about, what is important is that they do. Creating interactions in the community, creating a name for themselves. Getting recognized. Reputation matter, and having access to someone&#x27;s thought stream over time is incredibly valuable in trying to estimate their abilities.&#xA;In the end, however, there is really no substitute for working with someone to actually evaluate their skills (which is a transient thing) and their abilities (which tend to change far more slowly, and what I really care about). Any attempt to short circuit the process is going to end in tears.&#xA;* That is his real name, and I had the pleasure of having him as my boss for over two years. Sadly, he doesn&#x27;t have a blog. And yes, this is my own gentle way of trying to get him one.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The answer is a sound yes, but for a given value of success.&#xA;A bad team can still get a product out, and that product may even be successful. But the cost that this requires is far greater than it would have been otherwise, often to the point where you have no choice but to scrap the project. The really sad part is that some people accept this cost as the true cost of building software.&#xA;Oh, and good people doesn&#x27;t necessarily equate to experts.&#xA;You need a few good people, but the rest of the team can follow fairly simple check list approach to development. There are a lot of stories about teams like that, and most of them end with a big project failure. Usually, this is because there was a hard separation between the people the business consider as the high end and the regular developers. This usually cause the people who actually dictate the architecture and shape of the system to become totally oblivious of any design issues that they may inflict on the rest of the team.&#xA;Having a mixed team, with the architecture and the implementation done by the same group, is a much better proposition in the long term. Note, however, that I am explicitly not saying that the whole team should take part in the design. This is an ideal circumstance, and I haven&#x27;t found it to be either common or even desirable in many cases. Design by committee is rarely a good idea, and I much prefer either design by addition or design by feature / feature batch. Again, those depends on the type of team that I am working on.&#xA;Another thing to note is the difference between technological experts and business experts. In both cases, we are talking about developers, but in technological experts are good for one thing, clearing the way so the developers who actually understand the business can get things done, fast.&#xA;I will reference again my posts about JFHCI, as a good example of how I think those things should be done.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Yes, I know, 2003 called and asked to get its distribution technology back. Nevertheless, remoting is an extremely useful tool, if you can make several assumptions about the way that you are going to use it. In my case, I am assuming inter process, local machine configuration, with high expectation of reliability from both ends. Considering that I also need low latency, it seems like an appropriate solution indeed. I was pretty happy about this, until all my integration tests start to break. After a while, I managed to figure out that the root cause for that is this error: Because of security restrictions, the type XYZ cannot be accessed. Now, it worked, and it worked for a long time. What the hell is going on? After thinking about this for a while, I realized that the major thing that changed was that I am now signing my assemblies. And that caused all hell to break lose. I managed to find this post with the solution, but I am still not happy. I really dislike things that can just go and break on me.</p>

I kinda of like their licensing agreement.    Argh, that is so stupid. I am trying to give you money, why are you trying so hard to make this hard on me?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I think that I mentioned that NHibernate Profiler is working mostly by doing some smarts on top of the log output from NHibernate. That is not exactly the case, but that is close enough. The problem with working through the logs is that there are roughly 30 lines of XML that you need to deal with in order to manage this properly.&#xA;The first time I sent this to anyone else, he run into problems with the configuration because of very subtle issues. For a while now, I had a ticket saying that I need to document what the failure scenarios are, and how to deal with them.&#xA;Today, as I sat down to deal with this ticket, I decided that it is wrong to even try. This is shoving my own problems to my users. I shouldn&#x27;t do that, if the configuration is hard to do, that is my own issue, and not theirs. I should bear the burden of complexity.&#xA;As such, I spent some additional time getting this to work in the smoothest way possible. The end result is that in order to use NHibernate Profiler in your application, all you need to do is add the following line at the application startup (Main, Application_Start, etc).&#xA;&#xA;NHibernateProfiler.Initialize();&#xA;&#xA;That is it :-)</p>
