            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/6/2010I recently had a few discussions with several startups, in the process of going to the cloud. One of the first questions that I ask is &#x201C;what is your licensing/revue model?&#x201D;.  At first, I usually get some very funny looks, I am not there to do business consulting, but to do technical stuff. Why do I stick my nose into things that have absolutely nothing to do with technical stuff?  The answer is quite simple, you have to consider the money side of things in your architecture. Let me give you a real world example. A startup that I was talking with was talking about creating a SAAS system on the cloud. Each client would pay&#xA0; a flat fee of 150$ per month. When I started talking with them, the idea was to use EC2&#x2019;s ability to just create a new node on the fly, and give each client their own server. That would allow very easy development and deployment, and remove a whole bunch of complexity.  I even agreed, except that I raised one small problem. Each server would cost them roughly 250$ per month. I had to ask them: &#x201C;Do you intend to make it up in volume?&#x201D;  We always had to make those sort of calls, but especially when we are using the cloud it becomes so much clearer. We have to take into account the actual real world costs of our architecture choices, and in many cases, we have to adapt our practices to the actual economical realities.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/6/2010That is actually an inaccurate statement, for the most part. A more accurate way of saying this is that for the most part, you don&#x2019;t need to think about scaling a multi tenant environment. Most multi tenant environments are using some form of a user based licensing method, which means that for the vast majority of tenants, there aren&#x2019;t going to be a lot of users. That means that we have a very natural way of isolating things. Handling a single tenant is very easy, then, because we are actually handling small amount of users and (relatively) small amount of information.  The challenge begins when we need to consider how to work with all the tenants. My general approach to that is actually to think upfront about the sort of things that would prevent me from scaling things, and avoid those, but not do anything else about it. Let us consider what I mean&#x2026;  The easiest way to handle multi tenant application is when you create total separation between each tenant. It is fairly easy to do, all you have to ensure is a separate data store (note that you really need to ensure separate caches, as well), and everything else more or less flows from there. In most multi tenant applications, there are four things that may vary between tenants:     Schema    Data    Behavior    User Interface   The first two are handled at the data store level (and is usually very easy), while the last two are just application code (be it separate dll, tenant scripts, configuration, etc).   Given all of that, scaling multi tenant applications is usually a process that is handled by the load balancer. What you need is to specify which tenants are served by which servers, and to ensure that you don&#x2019;t overload each server capacity. If you want to be really smart about it, you can do load based load balancing, but for the most part, even static routing that gives each server X number of tenants would work.  This helps a lot because it means that for the most part, even though you are writing a distributed app that may have a very large number of total users, your actual application can behave as if it was a small application. That means that you can do thinks like memory based caching, instead of distributed caching, because all the tenant users are going to be served from the same server.  And what happen if you have a tenant with thousands of users?  At that point, doing this sort of trick won&#x2019;t work, but presumably you are charging them enough to just allocate a single server for this tenant. In fact, assuming standard user based licensing, you actually got to the point where you have, as we say in Israel, a Rich Man&#x2019;s Problem. Even if they are big enough to require more than a single server, you can usually just split them to several, that is where the pre-planning for the scaling stoppers starts to pay. But in all honestly, it doesn&#x2019;t happen that often.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/5/2010&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;One question that comes up frequently with regards to running RavenDB on the cloud is how to take advantage of the cloud&#x2019;s ability to scale up &amp; down dynamically. The question to that is actually quite interesting.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;You don&#x2019;t.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That seems to give most people a pause, because it is totally unexpected. On the cloud, people expects to be able to dynamically adjust the number of servers they have based on their current load. After all, this is what you do with web and worker roles, no?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The problem with that logic chain is that is assumes equality between a Database and a web/worker role. For the most part, web/worker roles are pretty much stateless, they may have caches, but that is about it. That makes it very easy to add new servers when there is heavy load and remove them when the load goes down.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But for data roles, you can&#x2019;t really do that. What is going to happen to the data in that node when you take it down when there is less work to be done?&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;There are actually solutions for that, to tell you the truth, at least for RavenDB, because we can manipulate offline databases very easily, so we can shuffle them off &amp; on machines by just copying the document. But for the most part, it is actually too much work. Even for very large loads, a small number of sharded servers can more than keep up with your application, and while it is theoretically nice to have the ability to do so, you usually don&#x2019;t care.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/3/2010Let us say that we have the following document:     {&#xA;  &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Ayende&quot;,&#xA;  &quot;LastScore&quot;: 239.2,&#xA;  &quot;MaxScore&quot;: 392.6&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;And we want to find all documents whose last score is within a certain range from their max score. Note that for different queries, the range that I can use may be different.&#xA;&#xA;RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t offer the option of doing computation in the where clause. Mostly, that is because such computations are going to perform badly unless special care is taken to avoid that. Instead, we are going to create a computed field in the index.&#xA;&#xA;First, we define:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  from u in docs.Users&#xA;where u.MaxScore&#xA;select new { Score = u.LastScore / u.MaxScore } &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;This computed field now allows us to query on it very easily. Moreover, when we query, we are still querying over pre-computed data, which is going to blindingly fast.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/3/2010One of the things that are coming to NH Prof is more smarts at the analysis part. We now intend to create a lot more alerts and guidance. One of the new features that is already there as part of this strategy is detecting bad &#x2018;like&#x2019; queries.  For example, let us take a look at this     This is generally not a good idea, because that sort of query cannot use an index, and requires the database to generate a table scan, which can be pretty slow.  Here is how it looks like from the query perspective:    And NH Prof (and all the other profilers) will now detect this and warn about this.    In fact, it will even detect queries like this:</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/3/2010I also heard this term as &#x201C;Minimum Viable Product&#x201D;.  I use this term to describe what is the minimum set of features that we need before we can sell the product. This is something that is very important when you are talking about product development. Defining what is the point when I can sell the product defines a lot of other aspects of the product.  It defines the release schedule, it defines the architecture and the process we use for building, it define what is going to be in the Beta and in the 1.0 versions, and what is going to be deferred for vNext.  Note that Minimum Sellable Features is not the product roadmap. It is simply the point when you decide that charging money for the product is not going to be ripping off your product.&#xA0; My personal preference is that the moment that you reach this point, you start selling the product.  It is also very important to understand that Minimum Sellable Features has a minimum in the name. That is intentional, and descriptive. You want to make the list of required features to be as small as possible. The worst case is that your Minimum Sellable Features is also your Complete Features List. My rule of thumb is that Minimum Sellable Features should be about 5% of the Complete Features List.   Why is that?  Because that means that you only need enough money to get to the Minimum Sellable Feature point. Afterward, you should be able to generate cash flow and use that to continue development.  Why is this important?  It is all about feedback, it is much cheaper to get to Minimum Sellable Features and give customers the chance to tell us if they like it (by buying it) or why they don&#x2019;t like it (via feedback).  What if no one buys this?  Great! That means that you didn&#x2019;t have to burn as much money as you would have to discover that you are building something that no one would buy.  This is important, because you have to be very clear about your goals. My goals, when building a product, are:     Have fun    Make money   If I can&#x2019;t make it do both, then there are other rules that apply:     Fun but no money - becomes an OSS project. At which point I can skip doing all the unpleasant things like documentation.     Money but not fun &#x2013; outsourced the project.    Not fun, no money &#x2013; bye bye.   But the most important issue here is that your product is getting in the hands of the users very early. There are many strategies for reducing the number of features that has to be in Minimum Sellable Features list. For example, using a disabled UI button to show that this is an upcoming feature.  With Minimum Sellable Features, you usually sell the product at some discount, because it isn&#x2019;t complete yet. You might be familiar with the idea as beta discount.  Defining your Minimum Sellable Features is a good way to know how to get (and fast) to a state where you can actually get money from the users. It is important to be careful here and not provide something that is not functional, but assuming that you have something that is functional, the users&#x2019; feedback (and money) are invaluable.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Originally posted at 12/3/2010I recently had a discussion on how I select features for NH Prof.&#xA0; The simple answer is that I started with features that would appeal to me.&#xA0; My dirty little secret is that the only reason NH Prof even exists is that I wanted it so much and no one else did it already.  But while that lasted for a good while, I eventually got to the point where NH Prof does everything that I need it to do. So, what next&#x2026; ?  Feature selection is a complex topic, and it is usually performed in the dark, because you have to guess at what people are using. A while ago I setup NH Prof so I can get usage reports (they are fully anonymous, and were covered on this blog previously). Those usage reports come in very handily when I need to understand how people are using NH Prof. Think about it like a users study, but without the cost, and without the artificial environment.   Here are the (real) numbers for NH Prof:              Action        %        What it means                  Selection        62.76%        Selecting a statement                  Session-Statements        20.58%        Looking at a particular session statements                  Recent-Statements        8.67%        The recent statements (default view)                  Unique-Queries        2.73%        The unique queries report                  Listening-Toggle        1.10%        Stop / Start listening to connections                  Session-Usage        0.91%        Showing the session usage tab for a session                  Session-Entities        0.54%        Looking at the loaded entities in a session                  Query-Execute        0.50%        Show the results of a query                  Connections-Edit        0.38%        Editing a connection string                  Queries-By-Method        0.34%        The queries by method report                  Queries-By-Url        0.27%        The queries by URL report                  Overall-Usage        0.25%        The overall usage report                  Show-Settings        0.23%        Show settings                  Aggregate-Sessions        0.21%        Selecting more than 1 session                  Reports-Queries-Expensive        0.16%        The expensive queries report                  Session-Remove        0.13%        Remove a session                  Queries-By-Isolation-Level        0.08%        The queries by isolation level report                  File-Load        0.04%        Load a saved session                  File-Save        0.03%        Save a session                  Html-Export        0.02%        Exporting to HTML                  Sessions-Diff        0.01%        Diffing two sessions                  Sort-By-ShortSql        0.01%        Sort by SQL                  Session-Rename        0.01%        Rename a session                  Sort-By-Duration        0.01%        Sort by duration                  Sort-By-RowCount        &gt; 0.00%        Sort by row count                  GoToSession        &gt; 0.00%        Go from report to statement&#x2019;s session                  Sort-By-AvgDuration        &gt; 0.00%        Sort by duration (in reports)                  Production-Connect        &gt; 0.00%        (Not publically available) Connect to production server                  Sort-By-QueryCount        &gt; 0.00%        Sort by query count (in reports)                  Sort-By-Alerts        &gt; 0.00%        Sort by alerts (for statements)                  Sort-By-Count        &gt; 0.00%        Sort by row count           There is nothing really earth shattering here, by far, people are using NH Prof as a tool to show them the SQL. Note how most of the other features are used much more rarely. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that they are not valuable, but it does represent that a feature that isn&#x2019;t immediately available on the &#x201C;show me the SQL&#x201D; usage path is going to be used very rarely.  There is another aspect for feature selection, will this feature increase my software sales?   Some features are Must Have, your users won&#x2019;t buy the product without them. Some features are Nice To Have, but have no impact on the sale/no sale. Some features are very effective in driving sales.   In general, there is a balancing act between how complex a feature is, how often people will use it and how useful would it be in marketing.  I learned quickly that having better analysis (alerts) is a good competitive advantage, which is why I optimized the hell out of this development process. In contrast to that, things like reports are much less interesting, because once you got the Must Have ones, adding more doesn&#x2019;t seem to be an effective way of going about things.   And then, of course, there are the features whose absence annoys me&#x2026;</p>
