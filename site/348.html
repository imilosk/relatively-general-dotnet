            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I discussed the way the Smaz library works. Smaz uses a static shared dictionary, that was produced once from a known training set. FemtoZip, on the other hand, also uses a shared dictionary, but it is using a much more sophisticated system. To start with, it allows you to create the shared dictionary from your own data, not just the fixed data such as Smaz. However, that does require you to carefully pick your training set. And of course, once you have picked a training set, it is very hard if not impossible to change without complex versioning rules. I would have expected the FemtoZip version to compress much better, but it depend heavily on the training set it has, and selecting the appropriate one is relatively hard in a general purpose manner. In my tests, I wasn&#x27;t able to find a training set that would do better than Smaz, I tried a bunch, including using Smaz&#x27;s own dictionary, but it seems like Smaz has done a pretty good job in selecting the relevant outputs. Or perhaps the strings I was testing were optimal for Smaz, I&#x27;m not sure. I also looked at Shoco, but it took very little time to rule it out. It only supports ASCII strings, which is about as far from helpful as you can get, in this day and age. Smaz isn&#x27;t doing too great on non ASCII characters, but it has a fixed growth per length of unfamiliar terms, which is much better than doubling the size as in Shoco. For our needs, I believe that we&#x27;ll need to have a static version of the dictionary anyway, so there isn&#x27;t a major benefit to being able to train them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Smaz is a small library for compressing small strings. It is strange to talk about reverse engineering such a project, because Smaz is open source and is available on GitHub. Nevertheless the code on GitHub is actually only part of the story. It is dense,&#xA0; and it was generated by a script that isn&#x27;t included. That means that when we read the code, we are missing some key components, in particular, you are looking at an end result, without knowing how you got there. Compression algorithms take advantage of repetitions in text to reduce the overall size. State of the art algorithms typically use Lempel-Ziv and Huffman coding to compress the data. But because they are typically making no assumptions about the data, and they require a bit of length before they can gather enough state to truly gather some steam and start reducing the output length.  That means that for small strings (up to a hundred bytes or so), there is no real benefit in standard compression algorithms, and often you&#x27;ll see an increase in the space taken. Smaz is meant to solve that for most common cases. It does so by using a prepared dictionary of common terms that can be easily compressed.  The first thing that you&#x27;ll encounter when you read the Smaz code is this:   This goes on for about 50 lines, and at first glance, it looks utterly incomprehensible. We&#x27;ll ignore this for now, and read further. The next item of interest is:   The cb postfix stands for code book, and rcb stands for reverse code book. It took me a while to figure it out, but the idea in the code book entries is that this is actually a hash table. Each string in the codebook is actually multiple entries, composed of a single byte length, the term text, and then the index in the codebook. There are possibly multiple entries in each value in the array, and we use the length of each entry to index into them. Let us see how this works:  int smaz_compress(char *in, int inlen, char *out, int outlen) {&#xA;    unsigned int h1,h2,h3=0;&#xA;    int verblen = 0, _outlen = outlen;&#xA;    char verb[256], *_out = out;&#xA;&#xA;    while(inlen) {&#xA;        int j = 7, needed;&#xA;        char *flush = NULL;&#xA;        char *slot;&#xA;&#xA;        h1 = h2 = in[0]&lt;&lt;3;&#xA;        if (inlen &gt; 1) h2 &#x2B;= in[1];&#xA;        if (inlen &gt; 2) h3 = h2^in[2];&#xA;        if (j &gt; inlen) j = inlen;&#xA;&#xA;This code just setup a temporary buffer, and hash the current input term&#x27;s bytes. Then we start getting interesting.&#xA;&#xA;        /* Try to lookup substrings into the hash table, starting from the&#xA;         * longer to the shorter substrings */&#xA;        for (; j &gt; 0; j--) {&#xA;            switch(j) {&#xA;            case 1: slot = Smaz_cb[h1%241]; break;&#xA;            case 2: slot = Smaz_cb[h2%241]; break;&#xA;            default: slot = Smaz_cb[h3%241]; break;&#xA;            }&#xA;            while(slot[0]) {&#xA;                if (slot[0] == j &amp;&amp; memcmp(slot&#x2B;1,in,j) == 0) {&#xA;                    /* Match found in the hash table,&#xA;&#xA;The value j is the current size we are checking, and we are using the hash value to get a particular slot in the hash table. Note that only the first 3 bytes are actually hashed. After the appropriate slot is found, we check whatever the term length is a match, and if so, whatever the actual strings match. If they don&#x27;t, we run the following code:&#xA;&#xA;slot &#x2B;= slot[0]&#x2B;2;&#xA;&#xA;this was a bit confusing at first, but what is basically going on here is that we move to the next entry in this slot. This is pretty neat, since it covers both empty slots (defined in the code as &quot;&quot;) and multi value slots and take advantage on the fact that C strings end with \0 without having to specify it explicitly.&#xA;So what happens if we have a match?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;In this case, we check if there are any verbatim bytes (bytes that we haven&#x27;t been able to compress that are stored in a buffer.). If there are such bytes, we do the following:&#xA;&#xA;Compute the space needed for the verbatim value.&#xA;Set the next flush point in the buffer for verbatim values to the current output location.&#xA;Move the output pointer after the location where the verbatim string will be written.&#xA;Reduce the length of the remaining output size by the verbatim length.&#xA;Note that we aren&#x27;t actually going to write anything yet. First, we need to emit the newly captured match to the code book:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is done by first checking if there is space (if there isn&#x27;t, we return an error). &#xA;Then we write a byte to the output buffer. But this is a very strange byte.&#xA;What is this &quot;slot[slot[0]&#x2B;1]&quot; ? Well, remember the structure that we talked about for the hash table entries? The first byte is a length, and the last byte is the index into the code book. So what we are actually doing is indexing into the entry to get the last value, which his the code book index, which we write to the output.&#xA;The rest is pretty much just book keeping information. We move the input buffer pointer according to the just discovered term, etc.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If no match was found, we just add the current byte to the verbatim buffer, and move on to the next one.&#xA;Now, let us look at this out label, and what it does:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Basically, it is a repeat of the earlier code when finding a match. If we have a large enough verbatim string, we need to flush it, so this takes care of it. The actual flushing is interesting:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If there is a single byte, we write 254 (single verbatim byte marker), then we write the byte. If there is more than a byte, we write 255 (variable length size), the length, then the verbatim string.&#xA;It is interesting to note that this can be written after the output byte has been written. It took me a while to understand this. Nothing wrong with it, but I like sequential writes much better.&#xA;The decompression is very simple. Read a byte from the compressed input, if it is&#xA0; 254, then the next byte should be copied verbatim to the output. If the byte is 255, then read the next byte, which is the length, and copy the next length bytes to the output. Finally, if the byte isn&#x27;t 255 or 254, it is an index into the code book table, and the value should be taken from there. &#xA;I wrote a managed implementation of this, which allows me to play much more easily with the codebook definition. This was because there are a bunch of terms in the Smaz codebook that aren&#x27;t really relevant for what we need. In particular, it looks like it was trained to find the most common values from a set of HTML documents, it has entries for &quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&lt;&quot;, etc. Instead of going with the 254 values that can be compressed, I pruned the list a bit, and ended up with just 245 items. &#xA;I was then able to change the compression format to be:&#xA;&#xA;If it is a value under 245, use the term from the codebook.&#xA;If it is a value higher than 245, it is a verbatim value whose actual length need to be figured out by subtracting 245 from it.&#xA;This allows me to save a byte if we have more than two verbatim bytes. &#xA;Smaz is a really simple and clean library, but it isn&#x27;t doing something very complex. It is a static shared dictionary approach, without the use of more advanced approaches. I previously written about a more complex compression systems for small strings, such as FemtoZip. You can find the previous post here (there was a whole series of them).&#xA;In my next post, I&#x27;ll try to compare the two options.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We recently had to deal with an interesting problem in an unreliable application. To make it simple, I&#x27;ll use this blog as an example, since that is much easier. Let us assume that you are reading this post, and have a sudden desire to post a comment. Now, you can do so, we&#x27;ll refresh the page, and you can see your new comment. So far, pretty simple and easy. That is the way we have been writing web applications since the nineties.  However, let us say that for whatever reason, we decided to put the actual content of the page inside a CDN, like Amazon CloudFront. The minimum amount of time we can store a page in a CDN is 5 minutes or so. The reason we want to use a CDN is so users&#x27; won&#x27;t be impacted when the site is down for whatever reason.  Now, there are two types of user interactions in the blog. There is me, writing articles, and posting them. And then there is the reader, who read the post, and then send a scathing comment about the post. The software in question suffers from occasional outages, so we needed to have a way to cover that without the users&#x27; noticing. In this case, we divided the operations into two categories. Rare, which require the software to be fully operational (in the example above, posting a new blog post) and common, such as a user posting a comment, which should work even in reduced availability mode. The solution was to utilize the CDN both for caching and reliability. The blog post itself is going to be hosted on a CDN, so if the core software fail, the user doesn&#x27;t see that. But what about the actual interactions? As it turns out, while we want the user to think that everything is fine, we are actually okay with delaying some things. In this case, the perceived operation is actually more important than the actual operation.  Let us consider the standard system behavior, when there is no failure. The user goes to a particular page, and get the cached results from CDN. At the same time, we contact the live site, to try to get anything that is happening after the cached version. In the blog post example, the Ajax call would be something like &quot;give me all the comments after 123&quot;. This takes us half way there, even though we use a CDN, we now have all the updated data when the user loads the page. Except that we can take it further. Instead of doing an Ajax call, we can open a web socket, and ask the server &quot;stream me everything after comment 123&quot;. As new comments come in, they will show up on the page automatically. If there is an outage, the user is going to see the latest version cached in the CDN, and won&#x27;t be aware that they aren&#x27;t getting the new comments. When the site is up again, we&#x27;ll have all the new comments show up, just like magic.  This takes care of the user&#x27;s reading habits. But what happens if the user is actually commenting? In the good case, the system is up and running, accept the new comment, distribute it to all the web sockets listening to the page&#x27;s comment, and everything si good. But what happens in the failure case? In this case, we are going to accept the user&#x27;s comment, and then write it to local storage. And from local storage, we will display it to the user so as far as the user is concerned, the comment was successfully posted. Naturally we need to retry on the background, and eventually we&#x27;ll send the comment to the server successfully.  And yes, this is only relevant for cases where we can actually afford to have the user believe that an operation has been successful when it hasn&#x27;t been. But for stuff like comments, this is a really good system to make sure that everyone has a good user experience.  Oh, and this also has the benefit of having an easy way to handle abuse. You can not send the comment to the server, but do show it to the user. This way the spammer think that they have successfully posted, but they are just spamming themselves.</p>
