            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Unlike previous posts in this series, this is actually something that happened to our own production server today. It resulted in our website being inaccessible for a a couple of hours, and like most such stories, its root cause is tremedously simple, and through a series of unfortunate accidents, it had escalated to a major issue. First, this post is dedicted to this book, which should be read by any self respecting developer whose code is expected to hit production.  This post is also written a few hours only after the incident was resolved. Before we actually implemented anything except a temporary workaround. I&#x2019;ll probably have another post in a couple of days to talk about the steps we are going to take to alleviate a repeat of this incident. The incident started innocently enough, when one of the guys on the team discovered that the startup time of a certain instance jumped by a lot. Investigating into why he realized that the issue was extremely slow responses from our server. That was a cause of triple concern, actually. First, why are we accepting such slow responses instead of time limiting them? Second, why are we making a remote syncronous call during startup? And third, why on Earth is our server so slow? Logging into the server, it didn&#x2019;t take long to see what the problem was. The www.RavenDB.net website (the code that runs the RavenDB website, not RavenDB itself) was consuming a lot of CPU and quite a bit of memory. In a bit to restore the other services which reside on the same box, we reset the process. Our main concern at the time was to restore service as soon as possible, and we planned on investigating further through the logs. However, in a few minutes, the www.RavenDB.net website started consuming more and more resources. At that point, we started considering a DoS attach of some sort and looked a the logs. The logs did show a very high number of requests, much more than I would expect. But looking further into them, it looked like they were mostly bots of various kinds indexing our site.  Considering that this might be the case of Google hammering us, we configured a robots.txt on the site and waited to see if this would have an impact. It didn&#x2019;t.  The next step was to take a process dump of the process, and then analyze it. During this period, we had to shut down www.RavenDB.net because it was killing all other services running on the server. Looking at the dump in WinDBG, we started with the obvious commands.  !runaway &#x2013; to find out the thread cpu times switching to the busiest threads !clrstack - to see what it is doing Honestly, this is a much nicer way of looking at this, though:  As you can see, the threads are currently actually doing parsing of a Razor template, and seems to be doing that on a fairly continous basis, consuming all system resources. At that point, I started getting concerned to the well being of the poor guy&#x2019;s inbox as a result of this code. That was the point where we actually did what should have probably been our first action, and looked at the error log of the website.  Previously, we looked at the live metrics and the request log, but didn&#x2019;t consider looking into the error log for the system. The error log for the website, for today only, was 6GB in size, and was pretty full of errors such as:   - error: (221, 88) &#x27;HibernatingRhinos.Orders.Common.EmailProcessing.EmailTemplates.RavenDBWebsite.Models.DownloadQuestionMailInput&#x27; does not contain a definition for &#x27;Unsubscribe&#x27; and no extension method &#x27;Unsubscribe&#x27; accepting a first argument of type And at that point, we had enough to point a suspicious finger. We have an email that we send out, and we used to have a valid template. At some point, the code was changed and the Unsubscribe was removed. Nothing broke because the template is just a file, not actually compiling code. However, in production, when we tried to send the email, Razor would parse the text, fail compilation because of the missing member, and basically thorw a hissy fit.  Update: We investigated further, and it looks like the following was the actual &#x201C;solution&#x201D; to the outage:  The &#x201C;solution&#x201D; is in quotes, becasue this fixes the problem, but we need to still implement steps to ensure that something like that doesn&#x2019;t repeat. Unforuntately, at that point, we would consider this email as failing, and move on to the next one. That next one would also fail, and so would the next one, etc. Because all of them failed, they would get picked up again next time this run.   Once we knew where the problem was. The workaround was to deploy a version with no email sending. For this weekend, that will work. But come Sunday, someone is going to go over this piece of code with a veyr fine comb. I&#x2019;ll post more about it once this actually roll around.</p>

Today we were summarizing what our current status in the recruitment round after a particularly disappointing interview, and we actually looked at the number and I was pretty bummed. Here they are:  The good news it that we have a couple of really promising candidates coming by soon, and I remember feeling this annoyed with the whole process in pretty much all other recruitment rounds.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After quite a bit of work, we have finished (at least for now) the Blittable format. As you can probably guess from the previous posts, we have decided to also implement small string compression in the Blittable format, based on the Smaz algorithm.  We also noticed that there are two distinct use cases for the Blittable format. The first is when we actually want to end up with the document on disk. In this case, we would like to trade CPU time for I/O time (especially since usually we write once, but read a lot, so we&#x27;ll keep paying that I/O cost). But there are also many cases in which we read JSON from the network jus to do something with it. For example, if we are going to read an index definition (which is sent as a JSON document), there is no need to compress it, we&#x27;ll just have to immediately uncompress it again. So we added the option to choose what mode you&#x27;ll use the data. Here are the benchmarks for speed and size for Json, Blittable (for disk) and Blittable (for memory) &#xA0; As expected, we see a major difference in performance between Blit to disk and Blit to mem. Blit to mem is comparable or better from Json in nearly all scenarios, while Blit to disk is significantly smaller than Json while having comparable or better performance at parsing time, even though it is compressing a lot of the data. For large documents, this is even more impressive: &#xA0; Blit to mem is 40% &#x2013; 75% of the speed of Json at parsing, while Blit to disk can be much more expensive (us to x2.5 times more than Json), depending on how compressible the data is. On the other hand, Blit to mem is already smaller than Json in 33% &#x2013; 20% for most datasets, but Blit to disk improves on that significantly, often by as much as 60% of the original JSON. In the companies.json case, the original file size is 67.25 MB, using Blit to mem we have a 45.29 MB file, and using Blit to disk gives us a 40.97MB.  This is a huge reduction in size (compared to appreciable fraction of a second on most I/O systems). So far, we look at the big boys, but what happens if we try this on a large number of small documents? For example, as would commonly happen during indexing? In this case, we see the following:  Note that Blit to disk is very expensive in this mode, this is because we actually do a lot. See the next chart:  Blit to disk is actually compressing the data by close to 20MB, and it is 5 MB smaller than Blit to memory. The question on what exactly is the difference between Blit to memory and Blit to disk came up in our internal mailing list. The actual format is identical, there are currently only two differences:  Blit to disk will try to compress all strings as much as possible, to reduce I/O. This is often at the cost of parsing time. Blit to mem just store the strings as is, which is much faster, obviously. It takes more memory, but we generally have a lot of that available, and when using Blit to memory, we typically work with small documents, anyway. Blit to disk also does additional validations (for example, that a double value is a valid double), while Blit to memory skip those. The assumption is that if the double value isn&#x2019;t valid, it will fail when you actually access the double&#x2019;s value, whereas we want to have such issues happen when we persist the data if we are actually going to access it later when using Blit to disk. Overall, a pretty good job all around.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I discussed the way the Smaz library works. Smaz uses a static shared dictionary, that was produced once from a known training set. FemtoZip, on the other hand, also uses a shared dictionary, but it is using a much more sophisticated system. To start with, it allows you to create the shared dictionary from your own data, not just the fixed data such as Smaz. However, that does require you to carefully pick your training set. And of course, once you have picked a training set, it is very hard if not impossible to change without complex versioning rules. I would have expected the FemtoZip version to compress much better, but it depend heavily on the training set it has, and selecting the appropriate one is relatively hard in a general purpose manner. In my tests, I wasn&#x27;t able to find a training set that would do better than Smaz, I tried a bunch, including using Smaz&#x27;s own dictionary, but it seems like Smaz has done a pretty good job in selecting the relevant outputs. Or perhaps the strings I was testing were optimal for Smaz, I&#x27;m not sure. I also looked at Shoco, but it took very little time to rule it out. It only supports ASCII strings, which is about as far from helpful as you can get, in this day and age. Smaz isn&#x27;t doing too great on non ASCII characters, but it has a fixed growth per length of unfamiliar terms, which is much better than doubling the size as in Shoco. For our needs, I believe that we&#x27;ll need to have a static version of the dictionary anyway, so there isn&#x27;t a major benefit to being able to train them.</p>
