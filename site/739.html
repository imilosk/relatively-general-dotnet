            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My last post made me think about how it is best to approach a problem in a dynamic environment. The problem that I have in mind is the one I solved with IoC and static typing here. The problem is as follows:  You have several customers, each of them has its own database, with its own schema, data and behaviors, There is a common ground between the customers, but each does (different things!) differently. You need to handle each incoming user according to its associated customer. For the purpose of discussion, let us say that we want to list all employees that are direct subordinates for the current user, where the employee&#x27;s names and their associations to their manager can change based on the customer. How would you approach such an issue using Ruby? This is not an idle question, I had to face such a task, and it is complex in the infrastructure layer, but still let me use clear, intention revealing code in most cases.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jacob Proffitt continues the DI discussion, and he opens with this:  Ayende Rahien responded individually to each of my posts himself, which is more than a little bit intimidating all on its own Despite rumors to the contrary, I want to mention that I abhor violence in all its forms. It always leads to having to fill forms in triplicate, and I got sick at that when they pulled form 34-C12 from the archives, just for me. Someone should remind me (on a non durable medium only) to demonstrate how you can get whatever you want, explicitly without violence in any form. It is both an interesting story, and it works. Now, to Jacob&#x27;s post, I will usually respond to things that I find interesting and rational, even if (or especially) if I do not agree.  All the heavyweight advocates of DI rely on powerful, relatively invasive tools to realize the benefits of Dependency Injection. Until you get those tools, the benefits of DI seem mainly theoretical. Actually.... *drums roll* no. Using DI with a container will certainly give you quite a few benefits, but you can get quite a bit from using DI directly. I met a guy in DevTeach which had done just that, with great success, using anonymous delegates and functional style. Nothing beyond a coding convention and what the language offered. As an aside, I would accept the powerful, but I reject the invasive tools part. An good IoC can and should be invisible to anything but the Main() method. (There are shortcuts that are easier to take if you are explicitly aware of the container, but it is most often used on naked CLR objects). The problem with DI, which is what the container want to solve, is that the moment you start injecting dependencies, you want some way to manage that, you can do that with a factory or a provider, but you get more benefits from using a container, since this allows you to centrally leverage some interesting concepts across the entire application.  If my client or company needs web pages that validate users against Active Directory and then allows them access to reports based on their group memberships, then telling me that I need some robust loose coupling framework in order to test my user maintenance library is flat out wrong. Hm, let us see...  public interface IAuthorozationService&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;bool Authenticate(string username, string password);&#xA;&#x9;bool AllowedTo(string action);&#xA;}&#xA;Simple, isn&#x27;t it? That is what we used on our last project, and that is what enabled us to switch the implementation from hard coded (used on the staging site) to database back-end (staging site, when doing it hard coded started to take too long) and to active directory (production).&#xA;If it takes you more than a minute to write that, there is an issue here. If you consider direct coupling to the Active Directory classes, then there is an issue. If you tell me that you can get he same thing from:&#xA;public static class AuthorizationProvider&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public static bool Authenticate(string username, string password)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//...&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public static bool AllowedTo(string action)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//...&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;}&#xA;Then I argue that there really isn&#x27;t any difference between the two, except that the interface based approach makes your collaborators easier to understand and work with. The second approach is a static Service Locator, which hides the dependency, but can do much the same as an IoC, but is more limited in terms of handling such things as life cycle.&#xA;&#xA;Outside of major corporate infrastructure projects, stringent loose coupling just isn&#x2019;t as much benefit as more naturally encapsulated OO techniques.&#xA;I strongly disagree, I find loose coupling to be an extremely useful idiom, important even in very small projects.&#xA0;The ability to look at a piece of code in isolation is a key factor for maintainability.&#xA;&#xA;So here we have a lot of architecture big wigs selling DI as best practices and not bothering to contextualize those statements at all. Again, Ayende is a good example of this. In Dependency Injection: More than a testing seam, he wraps up with &quot;Dependency Injection isn&#x2019;t (just) for testing, it is to Enable Change.&quot; Nice. So if I don&#x2019;t use DI, my projects can&#x2019;t change at all?&#xA;&#xA0;And here I was hoping to avoid a wig for the next two years at least.&#xA;I am very bad in debate tactics (see first paragraph for why), but I do believe that reversing a sentence and then attacking the reverse conclusion is not a fair tactic.&#xA;The ability to change the code is strictly a matter of the quality of the code, the amount of tight coupling, the amount of separation of concerns that you have there. DI or lack of DI doesn&#x27;t really into the equation on its own. You can certainly build DI-based projects that are impossible to change. &#xA;My argument is that DI is one of the tools that I use to make change possible. It is not the only one, naturally, and I am not saying it is the sole factor, but it is an important tool.&#xA;In addition to that, I don&#x27;t think that I have ever said that DI is good for everything and you should use it the next time you want to build a hello world program. Most of the advice that I tend to give (or that given by the people I respect) usually has the&#xA0;&quot;when applicable&quot; part.&#xA;&#xA;It all comes down to cost vs. benefit and that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m not seeing enough discussion of, here. What are the costs of using DI?&#xA;I think that the issues here are twofold, first, you see to significantly exaggerate the cost of using DI, out of proportion, I would say. The second is that you are trying to evaluate a part of the whole while refusing to consider the whole. DI is useful on its own, yes. It is much more useful when you have a container. There are different patterns for DI when you use a container and when you don&#x27;t, and there are different usage scenarios.&#xA;&#xA;Loose coupling is so far down my project priorities that standard OO practices are more than sufficient&#xA;Ookaaay.... so, according to you, this is a good approach?&#xA;public int GetCustomerCount()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;using(SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(Configuration.ConnectionString))&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;// ...&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;To me such code suffers from a numerous major issues, ranging from flexibility of implementation to performance concerns to transaction semantics.&#xA;&#xA;Only, everywhere I go for mock objects, I&#x2019;m being told that all the best projects are loosely coupled so what kind of incompetent fool am I for not implementing DI even before I ever thought of needing a mock object framework?&#xA;Jacob, in this case, consider this an official invitation to the Rhino Mocks mailing list, and a promise to ban anyone calling anyone else a fool or an incompetent.&#xA;Yes, mocks objects goes hand in hand with DI, because you need to get the mock behavior there. Yes, you can use TypeMock, but as far as I am concerned, the moment that I am doing that, I am in the same boat as I am when I am trying to test private methods. There is no need to do that.&#xA;&#xA;If I ever get into a project where loose coupling is a big enough concern that I have to consider seriously intrusive techniques in order to reduce the risks of dependency change,&#xA;Just to clarify, I find it hardly intrusive, and I am sadden to hear that you don&#x27;t consider loose coupling (which also means SoC) is important to the code base.&#xA;&#xA;Again, Ayende is an example of this attitude when he says, &quot;The main weakness of Type Mock is its power, it allow me to take shortcuts that I don&#x2019;t want to take, I want to get a system with low coupling and high cohesion.&quot; As a personal statement, I guess this is fine. If Ayende doesn&#x2019;t trust himself to write code appropriate to his requirements and resources, then by all means, he&#x2019;s free to handcuff himself with less powerful tools.&#xA;I appreciate your permission, but I think that you missed the point. My requirements are high cohesion and low coupling. In the end, I want code that I can read, understand and work with.&#xA;&#xA;That&#x2019;s not at all what he means, though. Too often this kind of statement isn&#x2019;t intended to actually target the speaker. The speaker is perfectly confident in their own abilities - in this case to create low coupling and high cohesion. It&#x2019;s the abilities of other developers they want to constrain. It&#x2019;s another manifestation of the &quot;programmers not doing things my way are idiots&quot; meme used against Visual Basic for so long.&#xA;I take offence at this statement. Rhino Mocks is a project that I developed because I wanted to have a mocking framework that I could deal with. It is an OSS project because I feel that other people can also use this functionality. It has never been my intention to use Rhino Mocks to preach My Way to the masses.&#xA;Nevertheless, Rhino Mocks reflect the way that I use a mocking framework, and the best practices that I and the community that has grown around it have discovered. I am using the same Rhino Mocks build as anyone else, for the same reason that I quoted above. This is not the case where I am handing down architecture to the stupid programmers down the hall: &quot;Thou Shall Have Loose Coupling, And That Will Be Enforced With Rhino Mocks&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Frankly, loose coupling isn&#x2019;t an absolute value anyway, so arguments that every decrease in coupling is automatically worth the cost are absurd on their face&#xA;Loose coupling comes with the cost of needing to understand the interactions within the system as a whole from the individual parts. I find that the ability to look at a piece of code in isolation, and then look at its interactions much easier than trying to grok a system that has tight coupling, since I can&#x27;t usually understand a piece of code is isolation. And, as always, it is entirely possible to have too much loose coupling.&#xA;To summarize this decidedly long post,</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last week I spent about half a day trying to get WCF to reliabely work against Microsoft CRM web services. I had plenty of trouble just getting the authentication to work, which I blame solely on my lack of experience in configuring WCF. The problem is that it is literally four lines of code in ASMX, and configuration &#x2B; code in WCF, which you have to get just right. A big issue there was that authentication failure in the CRM services (ASMX, basically), will return an HTML page explaining the problem, and WCF was willing to give me just the first 1024 bytes of it. Resorting to black magic hackery to get the real error message is nasty, I am not sure what to blame here, but I would say that WCF is to blame here for not showing the full error message even in the trace logs. My current problem with this is that the response from the CRM looks something like this: &lt;RetrieveResult xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/crm/2006/WebServices&quot; xsi:type=&quot;account&quot;&gt; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;owningbusinessunit&gt;{50C57583-5F04-DC11-AF65-000C29955492}&lt;/owningbusinessunit&gt; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;ownerid name=&quot;Oren Eini&quot; dsc=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;systemuser&quot;&gt;{48D20A98-5F04-DC11-AF65-000C29955492}&lt;/ownerid&gt; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;name&gt;oren eini2&lt;/name&gt; &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;accountid&gt;{8A1BBC3C-C44B-DC11-B6EF-000C292DA987}&lt;/accountid&gt; &lt;/RetrieveResult&gt; But WCF will return to me an object with all the fields set to null. The problem is that the result message has a lot more properties, and therefor, tags in it. The CRM web service appernatly pick and choose what it will send, and doesn&#x27;t bother to send empty tags for null proeprties. In the above message, the account entity has ~175 properties, so that is somewhat understandable. The problem is that there is no easy way to make WCF understand that. After running svcutil over the wsdl, I got a C# file that was 2MB (!!) in size, so manual intervention is out, and there seems to be no easy way to do globally. Playing with the options of svcutil also shows that WCF really doesn&#x27;t like that WSDL (in fact, it refused to generate DataContracts, instead relying on XML Serialization). Again, I am not really a WCF expert, but from&#xA0;my experiments, that&#xA0;may be possible, but it is complex, non-DRY, and not&#xA0;worth the trouble. I am using ASMX services now, which just works.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jacob Proffitt has another post, called Tilting at Windmill&#xA0;that expound on this subject, and Nate Kohari&#xA0;has a good response to Jacob&#x27;s first post here. In this post, Jacob starts with:  I&#x2019;ve been giving poor Nate Kohari a hard time over at Discord &amp; Rhyme. He has been very patient in Defending Dependency Injection. His attitude stands in sharp contrast to Ayende Rahien&#x27;s post today about testing Linq for SQL. Ayende&#x2019;s snide &quot;(Best Practices, anyone?)&quot; is exactly the attitude I lamented in my original post on Dependency Injection Jacob, yes, I fully believe that it is a best practice to be able to test code without using a hammer (TypeMock)&#xA0;to force the dependencies into order. And as I have already mention, I am doing quite a lot of stuff with dependency injection &amp; inversion of control that explicitly require separating the dependencies. Seams are just that, seams where I can put my own stuff, be it a mock object or a decorator or a proxy. They are incredibly useful in reducing the amount of concerns that I need to deal with at any given point. Jacob then continues to:  My hypothesis (entirely untestable, so technically a mere speculation) is that what happened is that in order to achieve 100% code coverage in their unit tests with methods that read databases or call web services or have other potentially nasty dependencies, someone came up with the neat idea to invert control of those dependencies so that unit tests could feed in an abstracted object that fakes those calls and the real logic of the methods could be tested without bothering the poor database (or whatever). That&#x2019;s a noticeable, pervasive, broad architectural change, though, especially if it is only used for unit testing, so in order to defend their idea, developers began looking for additional justification for this pattern. I don&#x27;t think that you will find anyone accomplished in unit testing that would say that achieving 100% coverage is a goal that you should strive for. In fact, you are usually explicitly warned from chasing that number just because is a nice round shiny one. Hell, Rhino Mocks itself has only 95% coverage, and I am not worried about it in the least. Dependency Injection &amp; Mocking often goes hand in hand, but they don&#x27;t need to be, and I value DI because I use it in conjunction with IoC, which means that I really don&#x27;t need to think about dependencies at all. That is a much better solution than any other alternative:  Seriously, with providers that allow you to contextualize defined sub-systems and something that allowed you to Mock objects in testing without having to feed those objects to the tested class, can you think of a good reason to use Dependency Injection? Providers are just an abstract factory with a static access, not really anything new. In fact, it is a service locator that can locate a single server. That means that I don&#x27;t have easy visibility for my dependency map. If I look at a class, I can see at a glance what it is dependant on when using DI, not so when I am using the static accessors. It also mean that I have no ability to pick &amp; choose what the dependencies that I will pass to my objects. Jacob&#x27;s answer to that is:  Any dependency that needs to be altered more frequently than a contextual provider framework would allow needs to be exposed for access by calling objects anyway, I&#x2019;m thinking. And who shoulder the burden of handling that? Who decide what should use what? I prefer&#xA0;a consistent approach, aided by smart tools, which, in the end, means that I have to spend little to no time thinking and managing dependencies. In fact, in most scenarios, you quickly forget that you even use DI, because that is so natural and the framework simply supports what you do. Trying to look at DI alone, without seeing how it is used in practice means that you miss the overall picture.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jacob Proffitt has&#xA0;a&#xA0;post&#xA0;about Dependency Injection, which he doesn&#x27;t seem to like very much.  The real reason that DI has become so popular lately, however, has nothing to do with orthogonality, encapsulation, or other &quot;purely&quot; architectural concerns. The real reason that so many developers are using DI is to facilitate Unit Testing using mock objects. Talk around it all you want to, but this is the factor that actually convinces bright developers to prefer DI over simpler implementations.  I do wish that people would admit that DI doesn&#x2019;t have compelling applicability outside of Unit Testing, however. I&#x2019;m reading articles and discussions lately that seem to take the superiority of DI for granted While the ability to easily mock the code is a nice property, it is almost a side benefit to the main benefits, which is getting low coupling between our objects. I get to modify my data access code without having to touch the salary calculation engine, that is the major benefit I get. I have had more than one occasion to experience the result of not doing so, and I have seen the benefits of breaking the application to highly independent components that collaborate together to create a working whole. Take that and join it with a powerful container (such as Windsor), and suddenly you gain a whole new insight into the way you are constructing your application, because the moment you are tunneling a lot of the dependencies through a single source, you find that there are a lot of smart things that you can do. Decorators, interceptors and proxies come immediately to mind, but there are quite a few other options as well.  All of this becomes particularly exasperating in the dead silence regarding TypeMock. Type Mock is a great library, and you can check this blog to see my discussion with Eli Lupian about it. The main weakness of Type Mock is its power, it allow me to take shortcuts that I don&#x27;t want to take, I want to get a system with low coupling and high cohesion. And from the comments to that post, again by Jacob:  How can you say that dependency injection (I&#x27;m not taking on the whole inversion of control pattern, but I might. Jury&#x27;s still out on that one.) creates loosely coupled units that can be reused easily when the whole point of DI is to require the caller to provide the callee&#x27;s needs? Because there isn&#x27;t a coupling from the unit to its dependencies, and there shouldn&#x27;t be a coupling between the caller to the callee&#x27;s dependencies. But even without the use of an IoC container, you can get a lot of benefit from DI, just the ability to pass a CachingDbConnection instead of&#xA0;an IDbConnection is very valuable, and not, this is not something that you can just put in some sort of a factory or provider, because you want that kind of decision to be made on case by case basis.  Ugh. I wish Ayende would admit that the only advantage to DI in his examples is to allow the mock objects to work, is all. There is no other compelling reason. Sorry, but I don&#x27;t think that this is the case at all. Dependency Injection isn&#x27;t (just) for testing, it is to Enable Change.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Mats (NPersist) is talking about Saving to Blob, basically suggesting that you can turn your persistence strategy into Table(Id, Blob):  An alternative would be to serialize the non-identity fields into a blob of some kind and save that to just one column in the database. The database table would then have primary key columns matching the identity fields and then just one more blob column for the serialized non-identity fields of the object. Since this basically prevent any useful filtering on the data, he suggest that you can extract columns outside the blob, much in the way we currently do with indexes. As far as I am concerned, this is the worst possible persistence strategy. It means that you have taken some of the great strengths of the database and turned it into a stupid file server, for no real benefit. Mats suggest that this can have positive performance implications, but I doubt that this is the case. Just consider the cost of doing something as simple as providing a sortable, paged,&#xA0;grid using this approach. If the user has chosen to sort on a column that is inside the blob, then you would need to pull all the table in memory, sort it, and then hand the application just the page it is interested in. It also completely destroy the possibility of working with the database with database oriented tools. I can go into my DBs and look at the tabular data, but 0x20495bacfca12312 doesn&#x27;t have much meaning to me. ETL tools, reporting, etc are going to become useless. Not to mention that now you are in versioning hell. Serialization is notoriously difficult to handle correct across versions, and to have all the data in the DB in a format that is sensitive to serialization is quite a problem. Handling associations between objects is another issue, I can use the DB&#x27;s FK capabilities if I am using the standard mode, but a blob can have no FK enforcement by the DB.&#xA0; In fact, I can&#x27;t really think of a good reason to do this, and I can think of plenty of reasons not to. As far as I know, there were &quot;Object &lt;-&gt; Blob Mappers&quot; on the Java side at one time, and they are one of the points that always come up when an argument about OR/M come up, because that is a really bad way to handle this requirement.  Note: There is a really good article on this issue with Java Serialized Objects &amp; Reporting that I have read a few years ago in an Oracle site, but I can&#x27;t find it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most common issues that people have run into with using NHQA is the DuplicateMappingException. The root problem is that you are adding both the DLL (which contained embedded resources mapping files) and the mapping files themselves.  Well, after getting tried of answering that question so often, I decided to fix the issue, and let NHQA knows about the issue, and try to resolve it. The fix is in the repository now, but I would like to have some more input before I would release it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note: I am writing this post in the express hope that it would help to change the current situation. I have been just recently informed about a significant problem with Linq for SQL. It doesn&#x27;t support testing easily. You can see the bug report here, and as usual, it was closed as Won&#x27;t Fix without even providing an explanation. Did I mention already that I don&#x27;t like Connect&#x27;s approach to it? Yes, I did. The root problem is a fairly simple one. Linq for SQL relies on reams of generated code, which means that if I have code line this:  var customers = from c in context.Customers &#xA;  select c;&#xA;Then I have no really easy way to mock what is going on in here. The generated code provides a concrete class without an interface, so it is very hard to mock, and naturally, System.Data.Linq.Table&lt;T&gt; is sealed, has internal stuff, and is utterly hostile to mocking.&#xA;You have to use mocking if you&#xA0; want to use the code above without hitting the database, and this is a core part of the way a lot of people work. Linq for SQL doesn&#x27;t take that into account.&#xA;The requirement for mocking aren&#x27;t really that onerous, we need and interface generated for the context class, and interface for Table&lt;T&gt; and that the generated code will default to using interfaces by default (Best Practices, anyone?).&#xA;Having to write adapters classes is something that TDDers on the .Net platform has become very familiar with, because of the insistence of using untestable practices throughout the framework. I am fairly tired of that, and I would certainly like to be able to skip this tiring process for once.&#xA;It is shocking to me that in this day and age the Linq for SQL team can still believe utterly ignore such practices and put hurdles in the path of easy testability. &#xA;Are we back to demos vs. reality development?&#xA;To finish, this bug has been closed, so it is not possible even to vote for it. At the very least, I would like to hear an explanation, and it had better not involved &quot;lack of resources&quot;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have currently stopped working on the UI for Rhino ETL, and it is an interesting experience. In the past, I have usually started with building the functionality and then adding the UI for it. That failed. The problem wasn&#x27;t that the functionality wasn&#x27;t there, it was that the UI wasn&#x27;t nice enough for use, or wasn&#x27;t pretty enough to attract. This time, I am doing it in reverse, I am building the UI first, at least the rough draft of it, and then I intend to go and hook everything up. This means that while the picture on the right looks very nice, it is mostly skeleton with nice UI, without much functionality. Right now it is just an editor for Rhino ETL scripts, but I am currently hooking up the requirements for a project system that would allow me to build some really interesting functionality on top of the scripts. You can see some of the ideas that I have in the live view pane, which should allow me to visualize everything in the project for ease of use. Doing it the other way around is not likely to be possible, sadly, except in the most trivial cases, so I think that I will skip that. Anyway, the point of this post is that by giving it a good looking UI, I make myself feel much better about the application. Working on an ugly application is distasteful, and you tend to just try to get away. Working on pretty ones make you want to improve the current state.  That is the whole No Broken Windows mentality again, by the way, as well as some self motivation practices. Beside, and that is a secret, working on the UI allows me to consider the back end in a very detailed way without getting too low level. Almost by accident, there is this Daily WTF post&#xA0;about just this issue. Insightful is not something that I use lightly with regards to the Daily WTF posts, but this one is certainly is. If you possibly can, make it pretty, you, your users, and the application will be thankful.</p>
