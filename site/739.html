            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Alex is talking about Data Layer Componentization, as it works in Base4 and apparently in the Entity Framework as well.   A data-layer component simply allows for information to be shared between different applications.  By supporting re-use data layer componentization allows you to break the duplication habit. You can still have silos, but the natural tendency to duplicate data disappears. Each new silo will instead contain only new types of data and where old types are required, simply pointers, or cross silo foreign keys. We have two different things here, a shared schema and a shared database. As far as I understand the idea, Alex is talking about having the ability to access the shared database in the same way, from all the applications in the organization, and not having the same schema in all the DBs for all applications, I envision is as something like this:   Taking this approach to its logical conclusion, I may end up with an application that is dependant on many databases. There are known issues with this approach, from the top of my head:  Reliability issues - the application talks to more than a single DB, so now any of the DBs going down will break it.  Maintainability issue #1 - since you have other application dependant on your database, how are you going to handle upgrades and changes to it? When you take down a single database / application, you need to take down a significant number of applications with it. Maintainability issue #2 - changing a single database can have a ripple affect to all the applications in an organization. Maintainability issue #3 - the way the previous application stored its data may cause severe issues for you when you try to consume it. Perhaps you access pattern dictate that you need to get data from several disparate tables, making it more expensive to get the data. Maybe the data that you want requires extra calculation that you want to store in the DB, etc. Maintainability issue #4 - In any big organization, it is very likely that you will have several database products in place (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc). Those have different behaviors at time, and would require that you would remember to treat them differently. Duplication issues - Quite often, the data in the database is not readily consumable, and requires a bit a business logic to handle properly. For instance, the policy status that the user sees may depend on the policy type and the risk level of the customer. If you want to do the same on another application, you need to duplicate this logic again. This can be a real issue if this is a piece of business logic that often changes. Security implications - leaving aside the problem of letting multiply applications to access a database, there are security implications that are beyond what can be specified using SQL permissions. The salary of an employee is only visible to the HR person responsible for the employee and its manager (if&#xA0;he is above level 16). Now, please try to define that using SQL Permissions. You can&#x27;t, at least not without a lot of awkwardness. This means that you need application level security decisions. To say that those are complex is a big understatement. FK issue - traditionally, cross DB FK are a problem, especially when you consider cross server and cross database products FKs. My current projects pulls data from five different databases into its own database, and several other sources like XML files, flat text files, etc. It all goes to a single database, where it is stored in a way that make it really easy for the application to consume it, and a lot of the difficult stuff has been moved to the ETL process, which make it much easier to ignore the way we get the data when I consume it. My personal preference is to create a silo, define a known master for the data that I want, and simply use an ETL process in order to get fresh data at regular intervals. This makes things a lot simpler from all perspectives. All of that said, I still don&#x27;t think that I understand why Alex thinks that other OR/M doesn&#x27;t support it. I have used the componentization technique in the past, it looks something like this:   It takes a bit of configuration to handle, but basically when you are asking to get a type from the common entities, it goes to one DB, and when you want to get your own type, it goes to the application DB. A nice property of NHibernate&#x27;s parameterized user types means that you can have cross database reference with ease. Meaning that you can have policy.Customer rather than have policy.CustomerId. A fairly big issue here is performance, since cross database joins are rarely possible (linked servers are one way, but they are a PITA and comes with their own set of problem), so you would need to be aware of that, but this is just a side effect of the approach used.  Am I missing something here?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had plans for this weekend. I really did. But it is not 05:35AM and for the second day in a row, I am watching dawn raise and feeling very annoyed at myself. Yesterday I started to listen to the March Upcountry&#xA0;audio book. Just to give you an impression, it is a 17 hours audio book, and I have just now finished it. Yes, this does mean that I spent most of the last to days listening to it. Luckily I am able to do other tasks while listening (mechanical only, nothing that requires concentration or beyond-reflexes thinking). To say it is intense is like saying that water are wet. I really love the style, and the narration is excellent. The story itself is very good, extremely detailed and believable and I simply love the characters. I am really pissed that the book ended in a cliff hanger, and as I am in the process of downloading the second book in the series right now, I woudl be seriously considering&#xA0;starting to listen to it right now, if I didn&#x27;t have about an hour to wait for it to get down. As a side result of this, I am on an Email Strike, which means that I am only giving cursory look in my inbox, which has ~70 unread conversations.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Scott Bellware brings up one of the most annoying habits from Microsoft, duplicating existing OSS stuff instead of promoting the use of the existing tool. He ends up the post by asking how long it will take before Microsoft will have its own mocking framework. On the theoretical possibility that they would do such a thing, let me express my feeling about this in advance:  I would be extremely pleased if Microsoft came out with a mocking framework that completely and utterly kicked Rhino Mocks&#x27; butt. I would be very happy because it would mean that I would get mocking for free, instead of spending quite a bit of time to make it work. That would mean that it would not look like this one, by the way. Somehow, I have my doubts that Microsoft would turn out something of Rhino Mocks&#x27; elegance. And if I say so myself, Rhino Mocks is one of the finest pieces of code that I have written.  That said, if they want a mocking framework, Rhino Mocks is FLOSS (free libre open source software), so they certainly have the possibility to just bundle it in (and even rename it to Microsoft Mocking if they really want to). That is what I wish they would have done for NUnit, Cruise Control, etc. If integration is what they want to offer, it is certainly something that all those projects would accept gladly. I know that I would.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just finished spending half a day implementing support for mixed mode authentication in my application. I am putting it here mostly to remind me how it is done, since it was a pretty involved process.  As usual, the requirement was that most of the users would use Windows Authentication in a single sign on fashion, and some users would get a login screen. I am using Forms Authentication, and I want to keep is as simple as possible. After some searching, it seems that most of the advice on the web seems to include building two sites, and transfering credentials between the sites.  Perhaps the best places to look for it is this image, that explains how Forms Authentication works, and these two posts from Craig Andera #1, #2. After reading those, I had a much better picture of what I needed to do.  This requires several steps that are supposed to be self coordinated in order for it to work:  Setup IIS for Anonmous &#x2B; Integrated security. In the web.config, specify forms authentication. In the Login Controller, you need to check whatever the user is a candidate or windows authentication. In my case, it is decided according to IP ranges, but your case may be different. If the user can do windows authentication, you need to send back a 401 status code. Here is where it get a bit hairy. You can&#x27;t do it from the login controller, because the FormsAuthentication Module will intercept that and turn it into a redirect to the login page.  You need to create a http module and register it last in the HttpModule sections, and there you can specify the 401 status code safely. I used the HttpContext.Items to transfer that request. After the request has returned, if Windows Authenticaton has been successful, you can access the user name in the ServerVariables[&quot;LOGON_USER&quot;]. Create a Form Authentication cookie as usual, and carry on with your life. The main issue here, as far as I am concerned was to make sure that I will do it in a way that is maintainable, there are several disparate actions that are taking place that are all needed to make it work.  It took a while before I could get to grip with what was going on the wire, so here is the code for this:private void HandleInternalUsersAndSingleSignOn()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;//semi-internal users and the like&#xA;&#x9;if(Context.ClientIpIsIn(Settings.Default.ExcludeFromWindowsAuthetication))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return;&#xA;&#x9;string logonUser = Context.GetLogonUser();&#xA;&#x9;if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(logonUser))&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//Internal installation and an empty user means&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//that we have not yet auttenticated, we register a request&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//to send a 401 (Unauthorized) to the client, so it will provide&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//us with their windows credentials.&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//we have to register a request for 401, which will be handled by the&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//Add401StatusCodeHttpModule on the EndRequest because we are also using&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//FormsAuthentication, and we need to bypass the FormAuthentication interception&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//of 401 status code.&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Context.SetContextVaraible(Constants.Request401StatusCode, true);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Context.EndResponse();&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;// will redirect to destination page if successful&#xA;&#x9;LoginAuthenticatedUser(logonUser);&#xA;}</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Another semi-post morten talk that we had today had to do about complexity. A co-worker has just found my windsor.boo file, and commented on the complexity that it invovles. We had a discussion about this. I aggreed with her that this is indeed complex, but, in over eight months of&#xA0;the &#xA0;project, it was the irst time that someone other than me had to deal with it, and for the rest of the team it Just Worked.  Side note: one of the things that I am going to make sure for the next project is make sure that the entire team has at least a rudimetry understanding of all the important infrastructure pieces. It got us to a discussion of whatever we can reduce the complexity. Considering what we need to handle in this project, we both agreed that we could not significantly reduce the complexity of the system and that the alternative were either going with a localized complexity zone or spreading it around the entire code base if we removed this functionality. We couldn&#x27;t reduce complexity, we could only move it around. By certralizing it in a single place we increased the local complexity of a single part of the application (not the complexity of the code, but the cmpliexity in understanding what is going there, IoC &amp; DI ). But trade off is that we made the rest of the code of the system much easier to work with and understand. What do you think?</p>
