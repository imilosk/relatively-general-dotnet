            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently began to read the &#x201C;indies&#x201D; in the Amazon&#x2019;s listing, and I wanted to point out some things that I really enjoyed: The David Birkenhead series: &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; If I have one complaint about this series, it is that it the books are fairly short, typically less than 200 pages. That said, they are very well written, and the main protagonist is likable almost from the get go.&#xA0; I just noticed that the latest (Commander) came out, and I read it in one sitting.  It is good, really good, military Sci Fi. It is believable, interesting and in general, a lot of fun. The Admiral Who series: &#xA0; In contrast to the Birkenhead series, no one can complain that those books are short. Each comes at around 500 pages or so, and they are filled with a lot of really good content. This is a reluctant hero story, and it reminded me strongly of Mat from the Wheel of Time, just in space.   &#xA0; The problem with most indie content on Amazon is that they are frequently poorly edited. In both cases, however, the editing is pretty good (not perfect, but good enough that it doesn&#x2019;t distract from the story). And the stories more than compensate for that. Just to give you some idea bout how goo they are, I am currently re-reading those books, and that is a honor that many professionally produced books just don&#x2019;t get. The Birkenhead series is supposed to have another book in late October (my thought, it is already late October, any later and it is November!) and while there isn&#x2019;t a release date for the Admiral Who series, I am looking forward to both eagerly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The composite pattern describes that a group of objects are to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to &quot;compose&quot; objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.  More on this pattern. This post is supposed to come on the 1st of Nov or there about, which means that I&#x2019;m going to do a small divergence into politics now. Here is an example of how the upcoming presidential elections in the states.      1: public interface IVotingUnit   2: {   3:     int Weight { get;set; }   4:     int CandidateId { get;set; }   5: }   6:&#xA0;    7: public class Voter : IVotingUnit   8: {   9:     [Obsolete(&quot;Racist&quot;)]  10:     string Id { get;set; }  11:&#xA0;   12:     int Weight { get;set; }  13:&#xA0;   14:     int CandidateId { get;set; }  15: }  16:&#xA0;   17: public class WinnerTakesAllState : IVotingUnit  18: {  19:     string StateCode { get;set; }      20:&#xA0;   21:     int Weight { get;set; }  22:     int CandidateId { get;set; }  23:&#xA0;   24:     public void AddVote(Voter vote){  25:         // calculate  26:     }  27: }&#xA;Yes, this is probably a bad example of this, but I find it hilarious.&#xA0; The basic idea is that you can have an object that represent many other objects, but show the same external interface.&#xA;Composites are usually used for the more CS style of programming. Composites are very common in tree structures such as compiler AST or DOM. But beyond that, I can&#x2019;t easily recall any real world usage of them in my applications. There are usually better alternatives, and you have to remember that when you speak about enterprise applications, loading / storing the data is just as important. And trying to implement the composite pattern under those circumstances will lead to a world of hurt.&#xA;Recommendation: If your entire dataset can easily fit in memory, and it make sense, go ahead. Most of the time, you probably should stay away.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering which is meant to &quot;decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently&quot;.The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.  More about this pattern. Bridge is quite complex, mostly because it is composed of Abstraction, Refined Abstraction, Implementor and Concrete Implementor. Here is a concrete example (pun intended):   Abstraction: CImage Refined Abstraction: CBmpImage, CJpegImage Implementor: CimageImp Concrete Implementor: CWinImp, COS2Imp In general, I don&#x2019;t like complex things, and of the top of my head, I can&#x2019;t think of a time when I used this approach. Until such time when I can see a really good reason why I would want to do something like this, I see very little reason to bother. Recommendation: Avoid, there are simpler options to solving those sort of problems.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In computer programming, the adapter pattern (often referred to as the wrapper pattern or simply a wrapper) is a design pattern that translates one interface for a class into a compatible interface.  More about this pattern. This pattern is the first of the first of the Structural Patterns in the G04 book, and for the most part, it is meant to be used solely when you are integrating two or more external systems / libraries. When I saw it used inside a system, it almost always a Bad Thing, mostly because inside a single system, you want to use one of the other structural patterns. HttpContextWrapper is a good example of using this pattern, and it links back nicely to the previous discussion on Singletons. HttpContext.Current was an issue, because it didn&#x2019;t allow easy overriding / mocking / testing. The new HttpContextBase class was introduced, but due to backward compatibility concerns, HttpContext&#x2019;s base class could not be changed. The solution, introduce HttpContextWrapper implementation that adapts between the two. Useful pattern, but all too often people try to use it to abstract things, and that is most certainly not what it is meant for. Recommendation: Use when you need to integrate with code that you can&#x2019;t change (3rd party, legacy, compatibility concerns) using a common interface, but avoid otherwise.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.  More about this pattern. I won&#x2019;t show code or diagrams here. If you don&#x2019;t know the Singleton pattern, you probably don&#x2019;t have any business reading this series. Go hit the books and then come back for the rest of my review. Of the top of my head, I can&#x2019;t think of a single pattern that has been as denigrated as the Singleton pattern. It has been the bane of testers anywhere, and just about any Singleton implementation had had to become thread safe, given the demands that we usually have from our apps. That basically means that any time that you use a Singleton, you have to be damn sure that your code is thread safe.&#xA0; When it isn&#x2019;t, this becomes really painful. That along would be a huge mark against it, since multi thread proofing code is hard. But Singleton also got a bad rep because they create hidden dependencies that were hard to break. Probably the most famous of them was HttpContext.Current and DateTime.Now. Singleton may have a tattered reputation and wounded dignity, but it is still a crucially important pattern. Most of the issues that people have with the Singleton aren&#x2019;t with the notion of the single instance, but with the notion of a global static gateway, which means that it becomes very hard to modify for things like tests, and it is easy to create code that is very brittle in its dependencies on its environment. Common workaround to that is to break apart the notion of accessing the value and the single nature of the value. So you typically inject the value in, and something else, usually the container, is in charge of managing the lifetime of the object. Common use cases for Singletons include caches (which would be pretty bad if they didn&#x2019;t stuck around) and the NHibernate&#x2019;s Session Factory (which is very expensive to create). Recommendation: The notion of having just a single instance of an object is still very important, especially when you use that single instance to coordinate things. It does means that you have multi threading issues, but that can be solved. It is a very useful pattern, but you have to watch for the pit falls (global static accessor that is used all over the place is one of the major ones).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A customer had a problem. They were mostly using the RavenDB HiLo algorithm for saving documents to the database, which is very fast &amp; cheap. That client, however, chose to use the identity method. Which means that RavenDB will assign the value.  This is usually used if you need to have sequential values. The identity is actually being managed internally by RavenDB, and that works perfectly fine.  Except&#x2026; What happens when you enter replication to the mix. The documents with the identity values are replicated to the secondary server, and there we don&#x2019;t have the identity value, we just have the docs being written with their full id. (users/1, users/2, users/3, etc). So far, so good. But what happens when you have a failover and you need to write to the secondary, and you use the identity? Well, RavenDB ain&#x2019;t stupid, and it won&#x2019;t overwrite the users/1 document. Instead, it will search for the next available opening from the smallest identity value generated and use that. The code looks like this:      1: private long GetNextIdentityValueWithoutOverwritingOnExistingDocuments(string key,    2:     IStorageActionsAccessor actions,    3:     TransactionInformation transactionInformation)   4: {   5:     long nextIdentityValue;   6:     do   7:     {   8:         nextIdentityValue = actions.General.GetNextIdentityValue(key);   9:     } while (actions.Documents.DocumentMetadataByKey(key &#x2B; nextIdentityValue, transactionInformation) != null);  10:     return nextIdentityValue;  11: }&#xA;This works, great. Except when you have large number of documents that have already been written. Instead of the brute force search, we now use the following approach:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   1: public long GetNextIdentityValueWithoutOverwritingOnExistingDocuments(string key,   2:     IStorageActionsAccessor actions,   3:     TransactionInformation transactionInformation,   4:     out int tries)   5: {   6:     long nextIdentityValue = actions.General.GetNextIdentityValue(key);   7:&#xA0;    8:     if (actions.Documents.DocumentMetadataByKey(key &#x2B; nextIdentityValue, transactionInformation) == null)   9:     {  10:         tries = 1;  11:         return nextIdentityValue;  12:     }  13:     tries = 1;  14:     // there is already a document with this id, this means that we probably need to search  15:     // for an opening in potentially large data set.   16:     var lastKnownBusy = nextIdentityValue;  17:     var maybeFree = nextIdentityValue*2;  18:     var lastKnownFree = long.MaxValue;  19:     while (true)  20:     {  21:         tries&#x2B;&#x2B;;  22:         if(actions.Documents.DocumentMetadataByKey(key &#x2B; maybeFree, transactionInformation) == null)  23:         {  24:             if (lastKnownBusy &#x2B; 1 == maybeFree)  25:             {  26:                 actions.General.SetIdentityValue(key, maybeFree);  27:                 return maybeFree;  28:             }  29:             lastKnownFree = maybeFree;  30:             maybeFree = Math.Max(maybeFree - (maybeFree - lastKnownBusy) / 2, lastKnownBusy &#x2B; 1);  31:&#xA0;   32:         }  33:         else  34:         {  35:             lastKnownBusy = maybeFree;  36:             maybeFree = Math.Min(lastKnownFree, maybeFree*2);  37:         }  38:     }  39: }&#xA;This can figure out the first free item in a range of billion documents in under 100 tries, which I am pretty sure if good enough.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Create objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning.   More about this pattern. This is how it looks like:  Surprisingly enough, there are very few useful concrete examples of this, even in the literature. A lot of the time you see reference to ConcreteImplA and ConcreteImplB. The original impetus for the Prototype pattern was actually:  avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the abstract factory pattern does.  avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the &#x27;new&#x27; keyword) when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application. That is actually quite interesting. As I mentioned in the Factory Method analysis post, I like the notion of using Factory Delegate (and thus avoiding subclassing) quite a lot. This is usually useful for behavioral objects, that contains little state (it would be more accurate to say that their state is behavior, such as a class that mostly contains delegate members for different things). But for those sort of things, you usually don&#x2019;t really need to modify them after the fact, so there isn&#x2019;t much of a prototype here. The second reasoning is not relevant for most things today. The cost of new is so near zero to be effectively meaningless. But something that isn&#x2019;t mentioned about this pattern is that it is very useful for multi threading. The notion of being able to handle a cloned object that can be modified independently of its original is key in things like caches, as you can see in the code above. We make heavy use of that internally inside RavenDB, for example, although we choose a slight more complex (and performant) route.  A key observation about this is that Prototype assumes long lives objects. Because otherwise, there wouldn&#x2019;t be the prototype instance to clone from. In wide variety of applications today, that is simply not the case. Most of our objects live only for a single request. And anything whose lifetime is longer than a single request is usually persisted to a stable storage, rendering the basis for the Prototype pattern existence moot. Recommendation: This is still a useful pattern for a limited number of scenarios. In particular, the ability to hand out a copy of the instance from a cache means that we don&#x2019;t have to worry about multi threading. That said, beyond this scenario, I haven&#x2019;t found many other uses for this.</p>
