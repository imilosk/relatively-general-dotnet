            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is pure &#x201C;scratch an itch&#x201D; design post, since I started thinking about the topic, I might as well put my thoughts in a structured format. I am going to use twitter for this example, and assume that my end goal is to be able to do graph traversal, not just finding neighbors. Applying this to other social network scenarios should be pretty easy.  I generated this graph using this tool, this works using mentions, rather than following / followers graph, though. It will server to give you an idea what I am talking about.    One of the fundamentals of computer science is: localizing data leads to greater read performance. This is true whatever we are talking about keeping the data in the CPU L1 cache or in a distributed networked system. Typically, part of a sharding strategy is to keep all the data related to a root in a single location. The problem is, of course, that graphs don&#x2019;t really have roots. And in most social network graphs, there is no such thing as a closed graph. There are, on average, ~7 million users within three hops from any twitter user. Now, it would be very easy to put 7 millions users to a single machine, except, as they say, they aren&#x2019;t the same 7 million users.  Given that, I think that I can come up with an approach to allow more efficient queries and higher localization in the graph. The model assume an open and dynamic model (indeed, it relies on that).  We starts with geographical distribution. When we create a new user, we will place it in a shard dedicate to the geographical location the user is located on. This is a piece of data that we can get cheaply, and it has the advantage that users that interact with their circle of physical friends would tend to be clustered together anyway.   Next, we start assigning weights to associations. We only take into account outgoing associations (which solve the problem with outliers for incoming associations such as @aplsuk), but with a small twist, the weight of each outgoing association is taken as a portion of the total number of outgoing associations. In other words, the value of an outgoing association when you are following 10 friends is 0.1, but when you are following 500 friends, the value of each association is 0.002.  Next, we place some value on each mention that the user twits. A mention indicate that the association is active. For that matter, we probably need to create silent associations if a user keep mentioning someone that they are not following. For now, we will say that this value is 1% of the value of an association. That means that if I am following 100 users and I mentioned another user a hundred time, the value of the association is 0.02.  How does gravity comes into play here? Well, each outgoing association exact a pull on a node. But moving a node between shards is expensive, so we give shards an escape velocity. When we check if we need to re-shard a node, we aggregate the pulls of all the associations per node. Only if one shard pull is higher than the current shard pull &#x2B; escape velocity will the node be shifted to the new shard.  Over time, this will tend to migrate most users close to the users that they are actively associated with. With that in mind, we can now move of to queries.  As I mentioned, I am interested more in this for graph traversal, and the good thing about this approach is that for the most part, most of the relevant information is located on the same shard. When the times comes to perform a query, we can assert that queries, too, need to have an escape velocity to cross a shard boundary. Unless there are enough outgoing connections to a given shard to overcome the escape velocity, outgoing connections to that shard are ignored. We can limit the cost of remote calls further if we increase the escape velocity for the query as the query search deeper. In other words, the escape velocity at depth = 0 would be 10, at depth = 1 it would be 100, at depth = 2 it would be 1000, etc.  While this represent a loss in accuracy of the results, it also mean that for the most case, results will tend to be more relevant.   Is this important if I don&#x2019;t care for graph traversal?  There is another issue to consider, quite aside from graph traversal. The gravity approach outlined will tend to higher localization, and most operations are local. Consider writing a status update to all the people interested in that, when you have good locality, the cost of such on operation grows down drastically, in fact, I would say, it is highly likely that many such operations could be completed completely locally.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">During the course of this series, I got a lot of people declaring: &#x201C;But you can do that with RDMBS if you use XYZ&#x201D;. The problem inherit in this statement is that it ignore the fact that if you really want to, you can use a hammer to put screws, it isn&#x2019;t nice or efficient, but you can do it.  I run across this Dare Obasanjo&#x2019;s post that explains the actual problem in beautiful terms:     What tends to happen once you&#x2019;ve built a partitioned/sharded SQL database architecture is that you tend to notice that you&#x2019;ve given up most of the features of an ACID relational database. You give up the advantages of the relationships by eschewing foreign keys, triggers and joins since these are prohibitively expensive to run across multiple databases. Denormalizing the data means that you give up on Atomicity, Consistency and Isolation when updating or retrieving results. And the end all you have left is that your data is Durable (i.e. it is persistently stored) which isn&#x2019;t much better than you get from a dumb file system. Well, actually you also get to use SQL as your programming model which is nicer than performing direct file I/O operations.    It is unsurprising that after being at this point for years, some people in our industry have wondered whether it doesn&#x2019;t make more sense to use data stores that are optimized for the usage patterns of large scale websites instead of gloriously misusing relational databases.&#xA0; A good example of the tradeoffs is the blog post from the Digg team on why they switched to Cassandra. The database was already sharded which made performing joins to calculate results of queries such as &#x201C;which of my friends Dugg this item?&#x201D; to be infeasible. So instead they had to perform two reads from SQL (all Diggs on an item and all of the user&#x2019;s friends) then perform the intersection operation on the PHP front end code.   I can&#x2019;t use most of the relational database traditional advantages anyway. Not the moment that I step out of a single machine boundary. At that point, I have to re-evaluate what I am doing to see if it make sense to have to deal with the traditional relation database disadvantages. In many cases, the answer is no, and a solution that fit the problem better can be found.  This is where the NoSQL databases started. I think that once they gotten mature enough, they have advantages for smaller scale solutions, but that is a problem for another day.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that I almost always do when I pay someone I work with (and that drive me crazy when it isn&#x2019;t done to me): I let them know that I sent the money. Trivial, isn&#x2019;t it? But I am working with people in different countries, and it appears that in the internet age, an international money transfer can take a week or or even two.  The problem is related to cash flow, I know that I am supposed to get X amount at date Y. But there are a million reasons why a payment may be late from lost invoices (yes, that really happened, and yes, the invoice was truly lost and not &#x201C;lost&#x201D;) to banking holidays to &#x201C;opps, the gal that handles payments got hit by a car and no one else knows how to do it&#x201D;. Then, of course, there are the nefarious reasons (I had a client withhold payment for 6 months, including at one point flat out denying that I did any work for them).  As I said, it is a cash flow issue, the fact that I am supposed to get X money at time Y doesn&#x2019;t mean that I will. But being told that the money was sent gives me much more confidence that the money will actually arrive.  And having told someone that the money was sent, I gain two things:     They probably like me much more than before (giving money to people tend to do that).    They can sleep much more easily.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Yesterday I talked about graph databases, outlining what they are and how they work. One of the interesting things about this series is that in many cases, I am posing a question (to myself), trying to answer it, then go and find out what other people do.  When thinking about scaling scenarios for a graph database, I had the following scenario in mind, a graph of nodes that is spread across multiple servers, where each member in the graph may reside on any machine in the system. The following diagram demonstrate what I am thinking about, each rectangle represent a different machine in the system:     Why is this important?   A single machine solution is obviously a barrier to scaling (and safety, but that is another concern. In a graph database, having relations between the node is the point, that makes sharding a bit more complicated, because unless you store the entire graph on a single machine, you are forced to query across machine boundaries. And you can&#x2019;t store a graph in a single machine, for the simple reason that it is unlikely that you can limit a graph to be that small. Think about the implications of Six Degrees of Separation for graph databases and it will be clear what the problem is. In real world graphs, everyone is connected to everyone.  The problem with breaking the entire graph across machines is that now it is much more expensive to do graph traversals. The following query, which previous run on a single machine:     new GraphDatabaseQuery&#xA;{&#xA;   SourceNode = ayende,&#xA;   MaxDepth = 3,&#xA;   RelationsToFollow = new[]{&quot;As Known As&quot;, &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Friend&quot;, &quot;Romantic&quot;, &quot;Ex&quot;},&#xA;   Where = node =&gt; node.Location == ayende.Location,&#xA;   SearchOrder = SearchOrder.BreadthFirst&#xA;}.Execute();&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Now need to touch 3 different machines. Worse, it isn&#x2019;t the number of machines that impacts that, but the spread of graph nodes across machines in the system.&#xA;&#xA;After spending some time thinking about it, I came to the conclusion that I can&#x2019;t envision any general way to solve the problem. Oh, I can think of several ways of reduce the problem:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  Batching cross machine queries so we only perform them at the close of each breadth first step.&#xA;&#xA;  Storing multiple levels of associations (So &#x201C;users/ayende&#x201D; would store its relations but also &#x201C;users/ayende&#x201D;&#x2019;s relation and &#x201C;users/arik&#x201D;&#x2019;s relations).&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The solution most likely to be successful is limiting the depth of cross machine node searches. In many cases, that is acceptable, I think. If we put the depth limit on 3, we can still give pretty good answers in a reasonable time frame. But the only way this can be made to work is with good batching support.&#xA;&#xA;The algorithm may look like:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  public IEnumerable&lt;Node&gt; DistributedTraverse(Node sourceNode, int depth, string relationToFollow, Func&lt;Node, filter&gt; predicate)&#xA;{&#xA;    if(depth == 0) // feeling defensive&#xA;        yield break;&#xA;        &#xA;    var related = GetRelatedNodes(sourceNode.ShardName, relationToFollow, predicate);&#xA;    &#xA;    foreach(var result in related)&#xA;            yield return result;&#xA;        &#xA;    if(depth == 1) // don&#x27;t even bother asking down the line&#xA;    {&#xA;        yield break;&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    foreach(var relationsByShard in related.GroupBy(x=&gt;x.ShardName))&#xA;    {&#xA;        var shard = GetShardProxy(relationsByShard.Key);&#xA;        var results = shard.BatchedQuery(sourceNodes: relationsByShard.ToArray(), depth - 1,relationToFollow, predicate);&#xA;        foreach(var result in results)&#xA;            yield return result;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;This give us a maximum amount of (depth * number_of_machines_in_cluster) &#x2013; depth remote calls: With a depth of 3 and 3 machines in the cluster, we would have a max of 6 calls. &#xA;&#xA;With that theory out of our heads, let us examine how real world Graph DBs tried to resolve this issue&#x2026;&#xA;&#xA;Neo4j (which seems to be pretty much the default for Graph DBs) doesn&#x2019;t handle this currently, there are some hints that they intend to offer cluster wide replication, but nothing about design or implementation details. Neo4j does offer write-master/read-slaves approach for scaling out, which is really nice, but even that approach is limited at one point, and in this post, I am focusing on what happen when you go beyond that point.&#xA;&#xA;FlockDB (which is what is used by twitter) does include, as part of its design goals: &#x201C;horizontal scaling including replication&#x201D;. However, FlockDB isn&#x2019;t trying to solve the problem outlined above, indeed, graph traversal is a non goal for it.&#xA0; FlockDB is more about finding one level of relations very fast than anything else.&#xA;&#xA;In summary, I believe that while you can shard a graph database, it place a very lot limit on the type of graph walking queries you can make. Now, just to give you an idea, Neo4j, for example, appears to be able to routinely handle billions on nodes on a single machines, so you might no need to scale higher than that..</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After a short break, let us continue the discussion. Think about a graph database as a document database, with a special type of documents, relations. A simple example is a social network:     There are four documents and three relations in this example. Relations in a graph database are more than just a pointer. A relation can be unidirectional or bidirectional, but more importantly, a relation is typed, I may be associated to you in several ways, you may be a client, family or my alter ego. And the relation itself can carry information. In the case of the relation document in the example above, we simply record the type of the association.   And that is about it, mostly. Once you figured out that graph database can be seen as document databases with a special document type, you are pretty much done.  Except that graph database has one additional quality that make them very useful. They allow you to perform graph operations. The most basic graph operation is traversal. For example, let us say that I want to know who of my friends is in town so I can go and have a drink. That is pretty easy to do, right? But what about indirect friends? Using a graph database, I can define the following query:     new GraphDatabaseQuery&#xA;{&#xA;   SourceNode = ayende,&#xA;   MaxDepth = 3,&#xA;   RelationsToFollow = new[]{&quot;As Known As&quot;, &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Friend&quot;, &quot;Romantic&quot;, &quot;Ex&quot;},&#xA;   Where = node =&gt; node.Location == ayende.Location,&#xA;   SearchOrder = SearchOrder.BreadthFirst&#xA;}.Execute();&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I can execute more complex queries, filtering on the relation properties, considering weights, etc.&#xA;&#xA;Graph databases are commonly used to solve network problems. In fact, most social networking sites use some form of a graph database to do things like &#x201C;You might know&#x2026;&#x201D;.&#xA;&#xA;Because graph databases are intentionally design to make sure that graph traversal is cheap, they also provide other operations that tend to be very expensive without it. For example, Shortest Path between two nodes. That turn out to be frequently useful when you want to do things like: &#x201C;Who can recommend me to this company&#x2019;s CTO so they would hire me&#x201D;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Today I had to modify a piece of JavaScript code. The code used return a single string, and I needed to modify it to return an array of objects. Using C#, it would have been easy, change the return type, hit the compile button, fix the errors, rinse &amp; repeat until it compiles.  In JavaScript code, however, it was much more complex, I had to find all the places where that method was called, and that particular parameter would pass unchanged throughout several functions before it was used, so I had to track that down. Pretty annoying.  And since I know that I&#x2019;ll get questions on that, here is the actual example:     getDocument: function (id, operation, successCallback) {&#xA;    $.ajax({&#xA;        url: settings.server &#x2B; &#x27;docs/&#x27; &#x2B; id,&#xA;        dataType: &#x27;json&#x27;,&#xA;        complete: function(xhr) {&#xA;            switch(xhr.status) &#xA;            {&#xA;                case 200:&#xA;                    var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);&#xA;                    var etag = xhr.getResponseHeader(&quot;Etag&quot;);&#xA;                    var template = xhr.getResponseHeader(&#x27;Raven-&#x27; &#x2B; operation &#x2B; &#x27;-Template&#x27;);&#xA;                    successCallback(data, etag, template);&#xA;                    break;&#xA;                case 404:&#xA;                    successCallback(null, null, null);&#xA;                    break;&#xA;            }&#xA;        }&#xA;    });&#xA;},&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I needed to change the template variable from to a dictionary of headers, since it needed to be processed elsewhere.&#xA;&#xA;As for where it was actually used, here is one such example, which shows several layer of indirection (because of continuations):</p>
