            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This came in as a comment for my post about encapsulating DALs:     Just for the sake of DAL - what if I want to persist my data in another place, different than a relational database? For instance, in a object-oriented database, or just serialize the entities and store them somewhere on the disk... What about then ? NHibernate cannot handle this situation, can it ? Wouldn&#x27;t I be entitled to abstract my DAL so that it can support such case ?   The problem here is that it assume that such a translation is even possible.   Let us take the typical Posts &amp; Comments scenario. In a relational model, I would model this using two tables. Now, let us say that I have the following DAL operations:     GetPost(id)     GetPostWithComments(id)     GetRecentPostsWithCommentCount(id)    The implementation of this should be pretty obvious on a relational system.   But when you move to a document database, for example, suddenly this &#x201C;abstract&#x201D; API becomes an issue.  How do you store comments? As separate documents, embedded in the post? If they are embedded in the post, GetPost will now have the comments, which isn&#x2019;t what happens with the relational implementation. If they are separate documents, you complicated the implementation of GetPostWithComments, and GetRecentPostsWithCommentCount now have a SELECT N&#x2B;1 problem.  Now, to be absolutely clear, you can certainly do that, there are fairly simple solutions for that, but this isn&#x2019;t how you would build the system if you started from a document database standpoint.  What you would end up with in a document database design is probably just:     GetPost(id)     GetRecentPosts(id)    Things like methods for eagerly loading stuff just don&#x2019;t happen there, because if you need to eagerly load stuff, they are embedded in the document.  Again, you can make this work, but you end up with a highly procedural API that is very unpleasant to work with. Consider the Membership Provider API as a good example of that. The API is a PITA to work with compared to APIs that don&#x2019;t need to work to the lowest common denominator.  When talking about data stores, that usually means limit yourself to key/value store operations, and even then, there is stuff that leaks through. Let me show you an example that you might be familiar with:     The MembershipProvider is actually a good example of an API that try to fit several different storage systems. It has a huge advantage from the get go because it comes with two implementations for two different storage systems (RDBMS and ActiveDirectory).   Note the API that you have, not only is it highly procedural, but it can also assume nothing about its implementation. It makes for code that is highly coupled to this API and to this form of working with data in procedural fashion. This make it much harder to work with compared to code using a system that enable automatic change tracking and data store synchronization (pretty much every ORM).  That is one problem of such APIs, it greatly increase the cost of working with it. Another problem is that stuff still leaks through.  Take a look at the GetNumberOfUsersOnline method. That is a method that can only be answered efficiently on a relational database. The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider just didn&#x2019;t implement this method, because it isn&#x2019;t possible to answer that question from ActiveDirectory.  By that same token, you can&#x2019;t implement FindUsersByEmail, FindUsersByName on a key/value store (well, you can maintain a reverse index, of course), nor can you implement GetAllUsers.  You can&#x2019;t abstract the nature of the underlying data store that you use, it is going to leak through. The issues isn&#x2019;t so much if you can make it work, you usually can, the issue is if you can make it work efficiently. Typical problems that show up is that you try to map concepts that simply do not exists in the underlying data store.  Relations is a good example of something that it is very easy to do in SQL but very hard to do using almost anything else. You can still do that, of course, but now your code is full of SELECT N&#x2B;1 and you can waive goodbye to your performance. If you build an API for a document database and try to move it to a relational one, you are going to get hit with &#x201C;OMG! It takes 50 queries to save this entity on a database, and 1 request to save it on a DocDb&#x201D;, leaving aside the problem that you are also going to have problems reading it from a relational database (the API would assume that you give back the full object).  In short, abstractions only work as long as you can assume that what you are abstracting is roughly similar. Abstracting the type of the relational database you use is easy, because you are abstracting the same concept. But you can&#x27;t abstract away different concepts. Don&#x2019;t even try.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Package management for .NET has long been an issue. I won&#x2019;t rehash the story, but you can read about a lot of the problems here.  There has been several attempts to replicate the success of Gems in Ruby, but none has really taken hold. Dru Sellers &amp; Rob Reynolds had decided to take a slightly different approach. Instead of trying to replicate Ruby&#x2019;s gems, just use them.  That is how Nu was created (and I really want to know what that name was picked, I nearly titled this post Dr. No). Before you can use Nu, you need to install it, which means that you have to make the following one time steps:     Install Ruby (you can also use Iron Ruby, but the Ruby installer is just sweet &amp; painless).    gem install nu   Once this is done, all you need to do to install a piece of software is just write:     nu install rhino.mocks    nu install nhibernate   And Nu will get the latest version (including resolving dependencies) and put them in your lib folder.  After executing the two commands above, I have the following contents in my lib directory.     castle.core    castle.dynamicproxy2    log4net    nhibernate    rhino.mocks   I like it, it is going to make things so much simpler!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got a question about the feasibility of porting Rhino Queues to Silverlight, but that isn&#x2019;t really something that can fit in that scenario. So I set down to write the design for a Silverlight queuing system. Just to be clear, I have no intention currently to actually build this at this time (well, not unless someone is willing to pay for it or I get a project that requires it). This is merely a way to get the design problem off my head.  Why can&#x2019;t we just port Rhino Queues to Silverlight?  There are two reasons, one is technical, the second relates to the different way that Silverlight applications are used. The first problem is that Rhino Queues requires a way to listen to incoming messages, but Silverlight offers no way of doing such (reasonably so, FWIW, since that would turn the Silverlight app to a server, and there are probably security issues with that).  The second problem is simply that the way most Silverlight solutions are structured, there is going to be a WAN between the Silverlight app and the server, and WAN between each client. Direct connections between the Server &amp; Silverlight client is likely to be possible only when using HTTP, and there isn&#x2019;t going to be any direct communication between different clients.  This usually looks something like this:     Rhino Queues is built on the notion of independent agents, each of them containing a full queuing stack. That model will not work for Silverlight. In Silverlight, we need to support all the usual queuing features, but each agent (Silverlight application) is no longer independent.  The Silverlight Queues model will be slightly different. We introduce a Queues server component which will hold the queues &amp; messages internally.      On the client side, the process of sending messages is:     Queues.Send(&#x201C;server&#x201D;, &#x201C;Orders&#x201D;, new Buy{ &#x2026; });    Message is saved to isolated storage    A background thread send the messages from isolated storage to the Queues server.   The process of receiving messages is:     A background thread periodically pools (an alternative is a Comet using something like WebSync) the server for new messages.    Messages are written to isolated storage    The Silverlight acknowledge the receipt of the messages.   There are some twists here, though.  In a Silverlight application, there are going to be several possible use cases:     Each Silverlight application has its own &#x201C;queue&#x201D; in the Queues server. That allows a one-way messaging platform with point to point notification. That is likely to be common in Silverlight applications that handle business transactions.     Topics, in addition to a queue per client, we might also want to allow subscription to topics, for example, I may be interested in getting notifications when the system settings have changed. That is something that is shared among all (or a lot) of clients. The Queues server should support this as well.   An interesting approach to make the Queues server even more stateless is to remove the process of acknowledgement and change it to &#x201C;give me all messages after&#x2026;&#x201D;  Yes, I know that this is a very high level design, but there really isn&#x2019;t much here that I can call very complex.  How much interest is there in Queuing system in Silverlight?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a question that I get routinely, both from random strangers and when I am at clients.     I would like to design a system/application using NHibernate. But I also want to so flexible that in future ,if I unplug the NHibernate and use ADO.NET Entity framework or other framework then my application should not       crash.   In short, I am completely opposed for even trying doing something like that.  It is based on flawed assumptions  A lot of the drive behind this is based on the historical drive built in the time where data access layers directly accessed a database using its own dialect, resulting in the need to create just such an encapsulation in order to support multiple databases.  The issue with this drive is that it is no longer a factor, all modern OR/Ms can handle multiple databases effectively. Moreover, modern OR/M are no longer just ways to execute some SQL and get a result back, which is how old style DAL were written. An OR/M takes on a lot more responsibilities, from things like change tracking to cache management, from ensuring optimistic concurrency&#xA0; to managing optimal communication with the database.  And those features matter, a lot. Not only that, but they are different between each OR/M.  It doesn&#x2019;t work, and you&#x2019;ll find that out too late  The main problem is that no matter how hard you try, there are going to be subtle and not so subtle differences between different OR/Ms, those changes can drastically affect how you build your application.  Here are a few examples, using NHibernate and EF.                     Feature          NHibernate          Entity Framework                        Futures          Yes          No                        Batching          Yes          No                        Transaction handling          Requires explicit code          Implicitly handled                        Caching          1st &amp; 2nd level caching          1st level caching only               This isn&#x2019;t intended to be a NH vs. EF, and it doesn&#x2019;t even pretend to be unbiased, I am simply pointing out a few examples of features that you can take advantage of which can greatly benefit you in one situation, which do not exists in another.  It has a high cost  In order to facilitate this data access encapsulation, you have to do one of two things:     Use the lowest common denominator, preventing you from using the real benefits of the OR/M in question.     Bleed those features through the DAL, allowing you to make use of those features, but preventing you from switching at a later time.    Either of those add complexity, reduce flexibility and creates confusion down the road. And in general, it still doesn&#x2019;t work.  There are other barriers than the API  Here is an example from a real client, which insists on creating this encapsulation and hiding NHibernate inside their DAL. They run into the previously mentioned problems, where there are NHibernate features specifically designed to solve some of their problems, but which they have hard time to implement through their DAL.  Worse, from the migration perspective, most of the barrier for moving from NHibernate isn&#x2019;t in the API. Their entity model make a heavy use on NHibernate&#x2019;s &lt;any/&gt; feature, which large percentage other OR/Ms do not support. And that is merely the example that spring most forcibly to mind, there are others.  The real world doesn&#x2019;t support it, even for the simplest scenarios  A while ago I tried porting the NerdDinner application to NHibernate. Just to point it out, that application have a single entity, and was designed with a nice encapsulation between the data access and the rest of the code. In order to make the port, I had to modify significant parts of the codebase. And that is about the simplest example that can be.  The role of encapsulation  Now, I know that some people would read this as an attack of encapsulation of data access, but that isn&#x2019;t the case. By all mean, encapsulate to your heart&#x2019;s content. But the purpose of this encapsulation is important. Trying to encapsulate to make things easier to work with, great. Trying to encapsulate so that you can switch OR/Ms? Won&#x2019;t work, will be costly and painful.  So how do you move between OR/Ms?  There are reasons why some people want to move from one data access technology to the other. I was involved in several such efforts, and the approach that we used in each of those cases was porting, rather than trying to drop a new IDaataAccess implementation.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just finish touching up a new feature for EF Prof, support for Entity Framework&#x2019;s Code Only feature. What you see below is EF Prof tracking the Code Only Nerd Dinner example:     I tried to tackle the same thing in CTP3, but I was unable to resolve it. Using CTP4, it was about as easy as I could wish it.  Just for fun, the following screen shot looks like it contains a bug, but it doesn&#x2019;t (at least, not to my knowledge). If you can spot what the bug is, I am going to hand you a 25% discount coupon for EF Prof. If you can tell me why it is not a bug, I would double that.  As an aside, am I the only one that is bothered by the use of @@IDNETITY by EF? I thought that we weren&#x2019;t supposed to make use of that. Moreover, why write this complex statement when you can write SELECT @@IDENTITY?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most common issues that I run into in my work is getting all sort of questions which sound really strange. For example, I recently got a question that went something like this:     What is the impact of reflection on NHibernate&#x2019;s performance?   I started to answer that there isn&#x2019;t one that you would notice, even beyond the major optimizations that NH had in that role, you are accessing a remote database, which is much more expensive. But then they told me that they profiled the application and found some stuff there about that.  I asked them what their scenario was, and the exchange went like that:     Well, when we load a million rows&#x2026;   And that is your problem&#x2026;  To be fair, they actually had a reasonable reason to want to do that. I disagree with the solution that they had, but it was a reasonable approach to the problem at hand.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The code for CommunityCourses can be found here: http://github.com/adam7/CommunityCourses  This is a RavenDB application whose existence I learned about roughly an hour ago. The following is a typical code review about the application, not limited to just RavenDB.  Tests  When I first opened the solution, I was very happy to see that there are tests for the application, but I was disappointed when I actually opened it.      The only tests that exists seems to be the default ones that comes with ASP.Net MVC.  I would rather have no test project than a test project like that.  Account Controller, yet again  Annoyed with the test project, I headed for my favorite target for frustration, the MVC AccountController and its horrid attempt at creating DI or abstractions.  Imagine my surprise when I found this lovely creature instead:     [HandleError]&#xA;public partial class AccountController : Controller&#xA;{&#xA;    public virtual ActionResult LogOn()&#xA;    {&#xA;        return View();&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]&#xA;    public virtual ActionResult LogOn(string userName, string password)&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (FormsAuthentication.Authenticate(userName, password))&#xA;        {&#xA;            FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie(userName, false);&#xA;            return RedirectToAction(&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;);&#xA;        }&#xA;        else&#xA;        {&#xA;            ModelState.AddModelError(&quot;logon&quot;, &quot;Invalid username or password&quot;);&#xA;            return View();&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    public virtual ActionResult LogOff()&#xA;    {&#xA;        FormsAuthentication.SignOut();&#xA;        return RedirectToAction(&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Yes, simple, work, simple, uncomplicated! You don&#x2019;t have to think when reading this code, I like it. That is how the Account Controller should have been, by default. &#xA;&#xA;The model&#xA;&#xA;I then turned into the model. Community Courses is a RavenDB application, so I am very interested in seeing how this is handled. The first thing that I noticed was this:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;That was interesting, I am not used to seeing static classes in the model. But then I looked into those classes, and it all became clear:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;This is essentially a lookup class. &#xA;&#xA;Then I switched to the rest of the model, the following image shows a partial view of the model, annotated a bit:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;The classes with the Id property (highlighted) are presumed to be Root Entities (in other words, they would each reside in their own document). I am not absolutely sure that this is the case yet, but I am sure enough to point out a potential problem.&#xA;&#xA;Did you notice that we have references to things like Address, Person and Centre in the model? They are marked with red and green points.&#xA;&#xA;A green point is when we reference a class that doesn&#x2019;t have an id, and is therefore considered to be a value type which is embedded in the parent document. A red point, however, indicate what I believe will be a common problem for people coming to RavenDB from an OR/M background. &#xA;&#xA;RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t support references (this is by design), and the result of referencing a Root Entity in another Root Entity is that the referenced entity is embedded inside the referencing document. This is precisely what you want for value types like Address, and precisely what you don&#x2019;t want for references. You can see in TasterSession that there are actually two references to Tutor, one for the Tutor data and one for the TutorId. I think that this is an indication for hitting that problem.&#xA;&#xA;For myself, I would prefer to not denormalize the entire referenced entity, but only key properties that are needed for processing the referencing entity. That make is easier to understand the distinction between the Person instance that is mapped to people/4955 and the Person instance that is help in Centre.Contact.&#xA;&#xA;Session management&#xA;&#xA;Next on the list, because it is so easy to get it wrong (I saw so many flawed NHibernate session management):&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;This is great, we have a session per request, which is what I would expect in a we application.&#xA;&#xA;I might quibble with the call to SaveChanges, though. I like to make that one an explicit one, rather than implicit, but that is just that, a quibble.&#xA;&#xA;Initializing RavenDB&#xA;&#xA;This is worth speaking about (it happens in Application_Start):&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;RavenDB is pretty conventional, and Community Courses override one of those conventions to make it easier to work with MVC. By default, RavenDB will use ids like: &#x201C;people/391&#x201D;, &#x201C;centres/912&#x201D;, by changing the identity parts separator, it will ids like: &#x201C;people-952&#x201D;, &#x201C;centres-1923&#x201D;. The later are easier to work with in MVC because they don&#x2019;t contain a routing character.&#xA;&#xA;Centre Controller&#xA;&#xA;This is a simple CRUD controller, but it is worth examining nonetheless:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Those are all pretty simple. The only thing of real interest is the Index action, which uses a query on an index to get the results.&#xA;&#xA;Currently the application doesn&#x2019;t support paging, but it probably should, which wouldn&#x2019;t complicate like all that much (adding Skip &amp; Take, that is about it).&#xA;&#xA;Next, the Create/Edit actions:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;They are short &amp; to the point, nothing much to do here. I like this style of coding very much. You could fall asleep while writing it. The only comment beyond that is that those methods are so similar that I would consider merging them into a single action.&#xA;&#xA;Course Controller&#xA;&#xA;Things are starting to get much more interesting here, when we see this method:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Overall, it is pretty good, but am very sensitive to making remote calls, so I would change the code to make only a single remote call:&#xA;&#xA;CourseViewModel ConvertToCourseViewModel(Course course)&#xA;{&#xA;    var ids = new List&lt;string&gt; { course.CentreId, course.TutorId, course.UnitId };&#xA;    if(course.VerifierId != null)&#xA;        ids.Add(course.VerifierId);&#xA;    ids.AddRange(course.StudentIds);&#xA;&#xA;    var results = MvcApplication.CurrentSession.Load&lt;object&gt;(ids.ToArray());&#xA;&#xA;    var courseViewModel = new CourseViewModel&#xA;    {&#xA;        Centre = (Centre)results[0],&#xA;        CentreId = course.CentreId,&#xA;        EndDate = course.EndDate,&#xA;        Id = course.Id,&#xA;        Name = course.Name,&#xA;        StartDate = course.StartDate,&#xA;        StudentIds = course.StudentIds,&#xA;        Tutor = (Person)results[1],&#xA;        TutorId = course.TutorId,&#xA;        Unit = (Unit)results[2],&#xA;        UnitId = course.UnitId,                &#xA;        VerifierId = course.VerifierId&#xA;    };&#xA;    int toSkip = 3;&#xA;    if (course.VerifierId != null)&#xA;    {&#xA;        toSkip &#x2B;= 1;&#xA;        courseViewModel.Verifier = (Person)results[3];&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    courseViewModel.Students = results.Skip(toSkip).Cast&lt;Person&gt;().ToList();&#xA;&#xA;    return courseViewModel;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is slightly more complex, but I think that the benefits outweigh the additional complexity.&#xA;&#xA;5N&#x2B;1 requests ain&#x2019;t healthy&#xA;&#xA;The following code is going to cause a problem:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;It is going to cause a problem because it makes a single remote call (the Query) and for every result from this query it is going to perform 5 remote calls inside ConvertToCourseViewModel.&#xA;&#xA;In other words, if we have twenty courses to display, this code will execute a hundred remote calls. That is going to be a problem. Let us look at how the document courses-1 looks like:&#xA;&#xA;{&#xA;    &quot;CentreId&quot;: &quot;centres-1&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;Status&quot;: &quot;Upcoming&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;NHibernate&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;StartDate&quot;: &quot;/Date(1280361600000)/&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;EndDate&quot;: &quot;/Date(1280534400000)/&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;UnitId&quot;: &quot;units-1&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;TutorId&quot;: &quot;people-1&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;VerifierId&quot;: null,&#xA;    &quot;StudentIds&quot;: [&#xA;        &quot;people-1&quot;&#xA;    ]&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And here is how the UI looks like:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;I think you can figure out what I am going to suggest, right? Instead of pulling all of this data at read time (very expensive), we are going to denormalize the data at write time, leading to a document that looks like this:&#xA;&#xA;{&#xA;    &quot;CentreId&quot;: { &quot;Id&quot;:  &quot;centres-1&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;SkillsMatter London&quot; },&#xA;    &quot;Status&quot;: &quot;Upcoming&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;NHibernate&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;StartDate&quot;: &quot;/Date(1280361600000)/&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;EndDate&quot;: &quot;/Date(1280534400000)/&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;UnitId&quot;: { &quot;Id&quot;: &quot;units-1&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;1 - Introduction to Face Painting&quot;},&#xA;    &quot;TutorId&quot;: { &quot;Id&quot;: &quot;people-1&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Mr Oren Eini&quot; },&#xA;    &quot;VerifierId&quot;: null,&#xA;    &quot;StudentIds&quot;: [&#xA;        { &quot;Id&quot;: &quot;people-1&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Ayende Rahien&quot; }&#xA;    ]&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Using this approach, we can handle the Index action shown above with a single remote call. And that is much better.&#xA;&#xA;I am going to ignore actions whose structure we already covered (Edit, Details, etc), and focus on the interesting ones, the next of which is:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;This is an excellent example of how things should be. (Well, almost, I would remove the unnecessary Store call and move the StudentIds.Add just before the foreach, so all the data access happens first, it makes it easier to scan). Using an OR/M, this code would generate 8 remote calls, but because Raven&#x2019;s documents are loaded as a single unit, we have only 3 here (and if we really wanted, we can drop it to one). &#xA;&#xA;Next, we update a particular session / module in a student. &#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;We can drop the unnecessary calls to Store, but beside that, it is pretty code. I don&#x2019;t like that moduleId / sessionId are compared to the Name property, That seems confusing to me. &#xA;&#xA;Charting with RavenDB&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;I am showing only the parts that are using RavenDB here:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;There is one problem with this code, it doesn&#x2019;t work. Well, to be bit more accurate, it doesn&#x2019;t work if you have enough data. This code ignores what happen if you have enough people to start paging, and it does a lot of work all the time. It can be significantly improved by introducing a map/ reduce index to do all the hard work for us:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This will perform the calculation once, updating it whenever a document changes. It will also result in much less traffic going on the network, since the data that we will get back will look like this:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;Person Controller doesn&#x2019;t contain anything that we haven&#x2019;t seen before. So we will skip that and move directly to&#x2026;&#xA;&#xA;Taster Session Controller&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;I sincerely hope that those comments were generated by a tool.&#xA;&#xA;The following three methods all shared the same problem:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;They all copy Centre &amp; Person to the TasterSession entity. The problem with that is that it generate the following JSON:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;References in RavenDB are always embedded in the referencing entity. This should be a denomralized reference instead (just Id &amp; Name, most probably).&#xA;&#xA;Other aspects&#xA;&#xA;I focused exclusively on the controller / Raven code, and paid absolutely no attention to any UI / JS / View code. I can tell you that the UI looks &amp; behaves really nice, but that is about it. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Summary&#xA;&#xA;All in all, this was a codebase that was a pleasure to read. There are some problems, but they are going to be easy to fix.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I used to be able to just sit down and write some code, and eventually things would work. Just In Time Design. That is how I wrote things like Rhino Mocks, for example.  Several years ago (2007, to be exact) I started doing more detailed upfront design, those designs aren&#x2019;t curved in stone, but they are helpful in setting everything in motion properly. Of course, in some cases those design need a lot of time to percolate. At any rate, this is the design for the Authorization Bundle for RavenDB. I would welcome any comments about it. I gave some background on some of the guiding thoughts about the subject in this post.     Note: This design is written before the code, it reflect the general principles of how I intend to approach the problem, but it is not a binding design, things will change.   Rhino Security design has affected the design of this system heavily. In essence, this is a port (of a sort) of Rhino Security to RavenDB, with the necessary changes to make the move to a NoSQL database. I am pretty happy with the design and I actually think that we might do back porting to Rhino Security at some point.  Important Assumptions  The most important assumption that we make for the first version is that we can trust the client not to lie about whose user it is executing a certain operation. That one assumes the following deployment scenario:     In other words, only the application server can talk to the RavenDB server and the application server is running trusted code.  To be clear, this design doesn&#x2019;t not apply if users can connect directly to the database and lie about who they are. However, that scenario is expected to crop up, even though it is out of scope for the current version. Our design need to be future proofed in that regard.  Context &amp; User  Since we can trust the client calling us, we can rely on the client to tell us which user a particular action is executed on behalf of, and what is the context of the operation.  From the client API perspective, we are talking about:     using(var session = documentStore.OpenSession())&#xA;{&#xA;     session.SecureFor(&quot;raven/authorization/users/8458&quot;, &quot;/Operations/Debt/Finalize&quot;);&#xA;    &#xA;    var debtsQuery =   from debt in session.Query&lt;Debt&gt;(&quot;Debts/ByDepartment&quot;)&#xA;                       where debt.Department == department&#xA;                       select debt&#xA;                       orderby debt.Amount;&#xA;    &#xA;     var debts = debtsQuery.Take(25).ToList();&#xA;&#xA;    // do something with the debts&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I am not really happy with this API, but I think it would do for now. There are a couple of things to note with regards to this API:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  The user specified is using the reserved namespace &#x201C;raven/&#x201D;. This allows the authorization bundle to have a well known format for the users documents.&#xA;&#xA;  The operation specified is using the Rhino Security conventions for operations. By using this format, we can easily construct hierarchical permissions.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Defining Users&#xA;&#xA;The format of the authorization user document is as follows:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  // doc id /raven/authorization/users/2929{&#xA;    &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Ayende Rahien&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;Roles&quot;: [ &quot;/Administrators&quot;, &quot;/DebtAgents/Managers&quot;],&#xA;    &quot;Permissions&quot;: [&#xA;       { &quot;Operation&quot;: &quot;/Operations/Debts/Finalize&quot;, &quot;Tag&quot;: &quot;/Tags/Debts/High&quot;, &quot;Allow&quot;: true, &quot;Priority&quot;: 1, }&#xA;    ]&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;There are several things to note here:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  The format isn&#x2019;t what an application needs for a User document. This entry is meant for the authorization bundle&#x2019;s use, not for an application&#x2019;s use. You can use the same format for both, of course, by extending the authorization user document, but I&#x2019;ll ignore this for now.&#xA;&#xA;  Note that the Roles that we have are hierarchical as well. This is important, since we would use that when defining permissions. Beyond that, Roles are used in a similar manner to groups in something like Active Directory. And the hierarchical format allows to manage that sort of hierarchical grouping inside Raven easily.&#xA;&#xA;  Note that we can also define permissions on the user for documents that are tagged with a particular tag. This is important if we want to grant a specific user permission for a group of documents.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Roles&#xA;&#xA;The main function of roles is to define permissions for a set of tagged documents. A role document will look like this:&#xA;&#xA;// doc id /raven/authorization/roles/DebtAgents/Managers&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  {&#xA;   &quot;Permissions&quot;: [&#xA;       { &quot;Operation&quot;: &quot;/Operations/Debts/Finalize&quot;, &quot;Tag&quot;: &quot;/Tags/Debts/High&quot;, &quot;Allow&quot;: true, &quot;Priority&quot;: 1, }&#xA;    ]&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Defining permissions&#xA;&#xA;Permissions are defined on individual documents, using RavenDB&#x2019;s metadata feature. Here is an example of one such document, with the authorization metadata:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  //docid-/debts/2931&#xA;{&#xA;  &quot;@metadata&quot;: {&#xA;    &quot;Authorization&quot;: {&#xA;      &quot;Tags&quot;: [&#xA;        &quot;/Tags/Debts/High&quot;&#xA;      ],&#xA;      &quot;Permissions&quot;: [&#xA;        {&#xA;          &quot;User&quot;: &quot;raven/authorization/users/2929&quot;,&#xA;          &quot;Operation&quot;: &quot;/Operations/Debts&quot;,&#xA;          &quot;Allow&quot;: true,&#xA;          &quot;Priority&quot;: 3&#xA;        },&#xA;        {&#xA;          &quot;User&quot;: &quot;raven/authorization/roles/DebtsAgents/Managers&quot;,&#xA;          &quot;Operation&quot;: &quot;/Operations/Debts&quot;,&#xA;          &quot;Allow&quot;: false,&#xA;          &quot;Priority&quot;: 1&#xA;        }&#xA;      ]&#xA;    }&#xA;  },&#xA;  &quot;Amount&quot;: 301581.92,&#xA;  &quot;Debtor&quot;: {&#xA;    &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Samuel Byrom&quot;,&#xA;    &quot;Id&quot;: &quot;debots/82985&quot;&#xA;  }&#xA;  //more document data&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Tags, operations and roles are hierarchical. But the way they work is quite different. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  For Tags and Operations, having permission for &#x201C;/Debts&#x201D; gives you permission to &#x201C;/Debts/Finalize&#x201D;.&#xA;&#xA;  For roles, it is the other way around, if you are a member of &#x201C;/DebtAgents/Managers&#x201D;, you are also a memeber of &#x201C;/DebtAgents&#x201D;.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The Authorization Bundle uses all of those rules to apply permissions.&#xA;&#xA;Applying permissions&#xA;&#xA;I think that it should be pretty obvious by now how the Authorization Bundle makes a decision about whatever a particular operation is allowed or denied, but the response for denying an operation are worth some note.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  When performing a query over a set of documents, some of which we don&#x2019;t have the permission for under the specified operation, those documents are filtered out from the query.&#xA;&#xA;  When loading a document by id, when we don&#x2019;t have the permission to do so under the specified operation, an error is raised.&#xA;&#xA;  When trying to write to a document (either PUT or DELETE), when we don&#x2019;t have the permission to do so under the specified operation, an error is raised.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;That is pretty much as detailed as I want things to be at this stage. Thoughts?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I wrote RavenDB, I started from the server, and built the client last. That had some interesting affects on RavenDB, for example, you can see detailed docs about the HTTP API, because that is what I had when I wrote most of the docs.  In the context of indexes, that meant that I thought a lot more about defining and working with indexes from the WebUI perspective, rather than the client perspective. Now that Raven have users that actually put it through its paces, I found that most people want to be able to define their indexes completely in code, and want to be able to re-create those indexes from code.  And that calls for a integral solution from Raven for this issue. Here is how you do this.     You define your index creation as a class, such as this one:      public class Movies_ByActor : AbstractIndexCreationTask&#xA;{&#xA;    public override IndexDefinition CreateIndexDefinition()&#xA;    {&#xA;        return new IndexDefinition&lt;Movie&gt;&#xA;        {&#xA;            Map = movies =&gt; from movie in movies&#xA;                            select new {movie.Name}&#xA;        }&#xA;        .ToIndexDefinition(DocumentStore.Conventions);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  Somewhere in your startup routine, you include the following line of code: &#xA;    IndexCreation.CreateIndexes(typeof(Movies_ByActor).Assembly, store);&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And that is it, Raven will scan the provided assembly (you can also provide a MEF catalog, for more complex scenarios) and create all those indexes for you, skipping the creation if the new index definition matches the index definition in the database.&#xA;&#xA;This also provide a small bit of convention, as you can see, the class name is Movies_ByActor, but the index name will be Movies/ByActor. You can override that by overriding the IndexName property</p>
