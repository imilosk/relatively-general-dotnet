Database schemas tend to mismatch in different environments, data in one of the databases may miss some crucial piece of data. Such occasions can be irritating, especially when caught in production.&#xA; The situation gets worse when you develop redistributable software. In this case, each of your clients has their own database instance whose structure may differ from others&#x27;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I introduced RavenDB Collection Specific Replication. This allows you to filter which collections you&#x2019;ll get to replicate.  The next step is to apply filters and transformers along the way. For example, like so:   As you can see, the transformation script allows us to modify the outgoing data, in this case, to hide the email address. This feature is primarily intended for data replication back to staging / development environment, where you have the need to have the data, but can&#x2019;t expose some of it outside.  It can also be used to modify details going to slave databases so we&#x2019;ll have per database values (for example, striping details that are not relevant for a particular tenant). Like Collection Specific Replication, this replication destination will not be considered to be a failover target.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">With RavenDB 3.5, we added a really cool feature to the RavenDB Replication. Actually, I&#x2019;m not sure how much of a &#x201C;feature&#x201D; this is, because this actually take away capabilities .  As the name suggest, this allows you to select specific collections and only replicate those to a specific destination. For example, in this example, we can see that we are only replicating the Categories, Companies and Employees collection, instead of replicating the entire database.   Why is this important?  Because it opens up new ways of managing your data. It allows you to use RavenDB replication (high throughput, reliable and error resilient) to manage data distribution. Let us imagine for a moment that we have a web ordering system, with multiple tenants. And we have some common information that needs to be shared among all the tenants. For example, the baseline pricing information. We can setup replication like so:  The Shared database contains a lot of information, but only the pricing information is replicated. This means that you can change it once, and it will propagate to all the end destinations on its own. Common scenarios for such shared data include:  Users /logins Base data for local modifications (product catalog that each tenant can override) Rules Note that because we are using collection specific replication, this does not make the destination database into a duplicate of the source. As such, it will not take part in failover configuration for the source database. You can mix and match, a single database can replicate to failover destination (full replication) and partial (only specific collections). And the clients will know how to fail to the right node if something bad happens.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the hardest practices to learn as a developer is to actually sit down and read the information that you have. Ever since we became a product company, we have to deal with partial information, because some data wasn&#x2019;t captured, or it isn&#x2019;t possible to capture more information because it is running in a production environment. That means that we have to do the most with the information we have available. Here are a few recent cases of having information, and ignoring it. A customer complained that a query was timing out. He provided the following error. {&quot;Url&quot;:&quot;/databases/Events/streams/query/&#xA;EventsByTimeStampAndSequenceIndex?&amp;start=9134999&amp;sort=EventTimeStamp&amp;sort=EventSequence_Range&amp;SortHint-&#xA;EventTimeStamp=String&amp;SortHint-EventSequence_Range=Long&quot;,&quot;Error&quot;:&quot;System.OperationCanceledException: The operation &#xA;was canceled.\r\n   at System.Threading.CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()\r\n   at Raven.Database.&#xA;Indexing.Index.IndexQueryOperation.&lt;Query&gt;d__5d.MoveNext()\r\n   at Raven.Database.Util.ActiveEnumerable`1..ctor(&#xA;IEnumerable`1 enumerable)\r\n   at Raven.Database.Actions.QueryActions.DatabaseQueryOperation.Init()\r\n   at Raven&#xA;.Database.Server.Controllers.StreamsController.SteamQueryGet(String id)\r\n   at lambda_method(Closure , Object , &#xA;Object[] )\r\n   at System.Web.Http.Controllers.ReflectedHttpActionDescriptor.ActionExecutor.&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass10.&lt;&#xA;GetExecutor&gt;b__9(Object instance, Object[] methodParameters)\r\n   at System.Web.Http.Controllers.&#xA;ReflectedHttpActionDescriptor.ExecuteAsync(HttpControllerContext controllerContext, IDictionary`2 arguments, &#xA;CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown &#xA;---\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.&#xA;CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.&#xA;CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter`1.GetResult()\r\n   at System.Web.Http.Controllers.ApiControllerActionInvoker.&lt;&#xA;InvokeActionAsyncCore&gt;d__0.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown &#xA;---\r\n   at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\r\n   at System.Runtime.&#xA;CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.&#xA;HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter`1.&#xA;GetResult()\r\n   at System.Web.Http.Controllers.ActionFilterResult.&lt;ExecuteAsync&gt;d__2.MoveNext()\r\n--- End of &#xA;stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---\r\n   at System.Runtime.ExceptionServices.&#xA;ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task &#xA;task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task &#xA;task)\r\n   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter`1.GetResult()\r\n   at System.Web.Http.Controllers.&#xA;ExceptionFilterResult.&lt;ExecuteAsync&gt;d__0.MoveNext()&quot;}&#xA;As you can see, that is a big chunk of text, and it require careful parsing. I&#x2019;m actually quite proud of this, even though the error is obtuse, it is giving us all the information that we need to figure out what the problem is.&#xA;In particular, there are two pieces of information that we need to see here:&#xA;&#xA;OperationCancelledException is thrown when we have a timeout processing the query on the server side. &#xA;start=9134999 is a request to do deep paging of about 10 million records, and then start reading. &#xA;Those two combine tell us that the issue is that we are doing deep paging, which cause us to timeout internally before we start sending any data.&#xA;But why are we timing out on deep paging? What is expensive about that?&#xA;Turns out that RavenDB does de-dup during queries. So if you got events/1 in page #1, you won&#x2019;t see it in page #2 even if there are results from the index for that document in page #2. If you care to know more, the issue is related to fanout and one document having many index entries pointing to it. But the major issue here is that we need to scan 10 million docs to avoid duplicates before we can return any value to the user. There is a flag you can send that would avoid this, but that wasn&#x2019;t used in this case.&#xA;Another issue that was solved by reading the message from the customer was:&#xA;Message&#xA;Version store out of memory (cleanup already attempted)&#xA; &#xA;Exception&#xA;Microsoft.Isam.Esent.Interop.EsentVersionStoreOutOfMemoryException: Version store out of memory (cleanup already attempted) at Raven.Database.Storage.Esent.StorageActions.DocumentStorageActions.RemoveAllBefore(String name, Etag etag) in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Database\Storage\Esent\StorageActions\Lists.cs:line 74 at Raven.Database.Smuggler.SmugglerEmbeddedDatabaseOperations.&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass12.&lt;PurgeTombstones&gt;b__11(IStorageActionsAccessor accessor) in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Database\Smuggler\SmugglerEmbeddedDatabaseOperations.cs:line 219 at Raven.Storage.Esent.TransactionalStorage.ExecuteBatch(Action`1 action, EsentTransactionContext transactionContext) in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Database\Storage\Esent\TransactionalStorage.cs:line 799 at Raven.Storage.Esent.TransactionalStorage.Batch(Action`1 action) in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Database\Storage\Esent\TransactionalStorage.cs:line 778 at Raven.Abstractions.Smuggler.SmugglerDatabaseApiBase.&lt;ExportData&gt;d__2.MoveNext() in c:\Builds\RavenDB-Stable-3.0\Raven.Abstractions\Smuggler\SmugglerDatabaseApiBase.cs:line 187 --- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown --- at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task) at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)Reported&#xA;25 minutes ago (08/02/15, 9:43am)&#xA;Level&#xA;Error&#xA;Version store out of memory happens when the size of the uncommitted transaction is too large, and we error. Usually that indicate some unbounded operation that wasn&#x2019;t handled well.&#xA;Those are almost always batch operations of some kind that do various typed of cleanups. In order to handle them, we are pulsing the transaction. Effectively committing the transaction and starting a new one. That frees the uncommitted values.&#xA;The problem was that this method had this behavior:&#xA;&#xA;So the investigation was focused on why MaybePulseTransaction didn&#x2019;t work properly. There is some heuristics there to avoid being too costly, so it was very strange.&#xA;Can you see the error? We were looking at the wrong overload, this is the one that takes a time, and the one that was called takes an etag. Indeed, in the version the customer had, that call wasn&#x2019;t there. In the current version, it was added.&#xA;Knowing how to read errors and logs, and actually paying attention to what they are saying is crucial when the time to fix a problem is at hand.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note, this is something that we are considering for 4.0. RavenDB uses JSON natively to handle pretty much everything. Which makes sense, for a JSON Document Database. JSON is easy to parse, human readable and for the most part, have no real complexity associated with it. However, while JSON is easy to parse, there is some computational overhead around parsing it. In fact, in our perf testing, we spend quite a lot of time just serializing and deserialzing JSON. It is one of the major costs we have to deal with, mostly because that is something that happens all the time. We have previous used BSON to store documents internally, but profiling has actually shown that it is cheaper to hold the data as JSON text and parse it. So that is what we are currently doing.  However, even faster parsing is still parsing, and something that we would like to avoid. There is also an issue with how this is actually represented in memory. Let us consider the following JSON: {&quot;FirstName&quot;:&quot;John&quot;,&quot;LastName&quot;:&quot;Smith&quot;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;In memory, this is represented as (highly simplified):&#xA;&#xA;Dictionary&lt;string,object&gt; instance&#xA;&#xA;string[] for the keys&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;FirstName&#x201D; string&#xA;&#x201C;LastName&#x201D; string&#xA;object[] for the values&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;John&#x201D; string&#xA;&#x201C;Smith&#x201D; string&#xA;In other words, especially for large documents, there are a lot of small objects that are being created. That doesn&#x2019;t impact immediate parsing cost, but those do need to be collected after the fact, and that is something that we would like to avoid.&#xA;We are currently considering using Flat Buffers for internal document storage. The good thing about Flat Buffers is that there is not intermediate parsing step. You get a block of memory that you can immediately access. That has two major advantages, loading the documents to memory would mean just reading a buffer from disk, with no extra cost. But it would also mean that the act of releasing a document would be much cheaper, we would only need to collect the buffer again, not potentially tens of thousands of small objects.&#xA;Another advantage is that we usually need to load documents to be indexed, and usually indexing only require very few fields from the documents. By avoiding the cost of parsing, only paying the price for the objects that we are actually touching, we are in a much better position to reduce the indexing costs.&#xA;A rough scratch schema using flat buffers would be:&#xA;union AnyValueUnion { Document, Array, Value }&#xA;&#xA;table AnyValue&#xA;{&#xA;    Value: AnyValueUnion;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Value&#xA;{&#xA;    Type: byte;&#xA;    String: string;&#xA;    Bytes: [byte];&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Array&#xA;{&#xA;    Values: [AnyValue];&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table FieldValue &#xA;{&#xA;    Name: string;&#xA;    Value: AnyValue;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Document&#xA;{&#xA;    Values: [FieldValue];    &#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The Values inside the documents are sorted by field name, so we can search a field using binary search. &#xA;&#xA;Nitpicker corner: Yes, we probably would want to use a hash here, but this is a rough draft to test things out, it will come later.&#xA;We need to optimize the schema, and using it will not be a lot of fun, but the speed and memory improvements should be significant.&#xA;Another alternative would be a schema such as this:&#xA;table FieldValue &#xA;{&#xA;    Name: int;&#xA;    Value: AnyValue;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Document&#xA;{&#xA;    Values: [FieldValue];    &#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;table Root&#xA;{&#xA;    Fields: [string];&#xA;    Document: Document;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Here we store all the field names once, then we refer to the field name using its index in the root object. This should have the advantage of reducing repeated string names.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This twit caught my attention:   This is interesting, on several levels. Mostly because there isn&#x2019;t any limitation here from the point of view of the bank. It is more an issue of how it always worked, and the implications of the payment method in question.  Now, I&#x2019;m not sure how renting works in California, but I do know how it typically work in Israel. So just to make sure that we are on the same page, let me explain a typical lease for an apartment. The lease contains a lot of legalese that probably matter a lot, but from a financial point of view, the typical method used are checks. In particular, for each year you typically give the owner 16 signed checks.  12 checks &#x2013; dated for each month, to the owner, for the rent each month. 1 security check &#x2013; typically 2 &#x2013; 3 months rent, to the owner, undated, marked as &#x201C;security&#x201D;. 3 checks &#x2013; undated, blank amount, for the electricity and waters companies and to city hall. Assuming everything works out, only the rent checks are ever deposited. The others are held and returned to the renter at the end of the lease. So far, so good. Now let us talk about the failure scenarios here. The reason that the owner require the additional checks is to cover exceptional cases. The renter not paying utilities, causing damage to the apartment,refusing to evict the apartment at end of lease, etc. Now, let us talk about the error handling for a lease. Assume that you have rented an apartment, and the renter has skipped town, left utilities bills unpaid, etc.&#xA0; The idea is that you can use the checks to pay utilities and cover at least some of the costs, maybe suing the renter afterward for additional costs. Of course, that does create a different set of problems. If the rent check bounced, it is very likely that the other checks will bounce as well. An alternative to this is a bank guarantee from the renter to the owner. Basically, we have a trusted 3rd party, the bank, in this case. Which promise to pay up to the specified amount if the owner demands it. The idea is that this turn the can&#x2019;t pay issue from the owner&#x2019;s problem to the bank&#x2019;s problem. In most cases, this cost the renter 2% &#x2013; 5% of the total guarantee. That is a relatively new concept for leases, and most people still use checks.  More to the point, most renters that can afford to use a bank guarantee are also ones that you probably won&#x2019;t have to use it on. So why the long explanation? Consider the business implications of having an un-deposited check. Until I actually deposit it, it isn&#x2019;t much. But when it is deposited, one of several things will happen. Either it is honored, in which case you have the money, or it isn&#x2019;t, in which case you have a proof that money that was owed to you wasn&#x2019;t paid. In Israel, you can take a bounced check to the Collections &amp; Enforcement Agency, and without needing a trail, start the process of collecting on the debt. This is a much short process, and typically it has a lot more teeth. For example, freezing bank accounts, etc. Now, let us consider the alternatives. A bank guarantee is still the best, because you get the money from the bank, and you are pretty much done. But those are expensive. Assuming that you require a 3 months bank guarantee, that typically mean that the renter need to pay the bank 15% of the monthly rent to get that guarantee, and the bank will typically freeze some amount of money (stock options, savings account, etc) in trust for that.  Assuming you don&#x2019;t have that, let us talk about the actual rent payments. Both renter and owner likely have easier time with wire transfers, but there is no good failure mode here. The problem here is that unless you use a check (which has a well define failure path), you don&#x2019;t have a good recourse for getting your money short of going to trail. Those are expensive, and you want to avoid them. There is a way to pay the rent via credit card, in some situations, but that usually cost around 1.5% of the rent (for the owner), and only up to certain amount. And it doesn&#x2019;t cover utilities / damages that the renter may have caused. In short, I think that a large part of the reason why paying the rent via wire transfer is that the error handling around it sucks .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Several months ago we decided to ramp up the RavenDB on Linux migration effort, and hired a full time developer to do just that.  We started this with great hopes, mostly because we were able to get Voron to run on Linux in a reasonable amount of time. But RavenDB is several orders of magnitude bigger than Voron, and we run into a lot more complexities along the way. In particular, and I am not quite sure how to put it nicely, the entire environment is pretty unstable. Our target was Mono &#x2013; 4.3.0, MonoDevelop 5.10 and Ubuntu 14.04. And it takes really no effort at all to break pretty much everything there. For example, SLEEP_DURATION_BEFORE_ABORT will, if you are running inside a debugger, or just running GC, sometimes, it will intentionally crash if certain operations takes longer than 200ms. But in general, it feels like Mono just isn&#x2019;t nearly stable enough for a production platform. Sometimes it would work fine, other time, you get horrible crashes in the process that required us to debug the mono runtime to figure out what is going on. Sometimes it was us doing stupid things, other times it was real bugs in the Mono runtime. Other issues related to missing websockets implementation (it appears to be there and then removed, for some reason), missing chunked encoding support etc. As an aside, MonoDevelop in particular is&#x2026; quite uncomfortable IDE, and it doesn&#x2019;t compare well in pretty much any level of experience to the experience you get from other IDEs. That just exacerbate the problem, to be frank.  In other words, porting RavenDB to mono is a lot of hard work. But that was pretty much expected. What I didn&#x2019;t really expect was how much work it would be not to port it, but to actually fill in missing / incomplete parts of the framework itself. Now, there are plenty of other problems in there even without Mono. Typically Windows &#x2013;&gt; Linux port, anything from file paths to case sensitivity to finding different ways to do various things (from finding how busy the CPU is to getting low memory notifications to &#x2026; well, you get the drift). Those are the kind of problems that we expected, and the kinds that frankly, we wanted to be solving. But the instability of the mono runtime environment make it really expensive to port any non trivial software without spending most of the time debugging Mono. Even if the error is in our code, the only way to verify that is to actually debug Mono itself. And that puts a much higher cost on the actual porting effort. More to the point, this also means frightening things for trying to support this in production. I don&#x2019;t relish the thought of having to go to a customer and tell them that a particular issue is caused by a GC bug and that fixing that will require a new custom runtime. Leaving aside the actual cost of such a support call. So we stopped, and looked at the CoreCLR. I have a much higher expectation of quality from Microsoft, given the track record of the .NET framework. The problem is that the CoreCLR, while it is supposed to have an RC out in November, it still quite problematic on Linux. For example, you can&#x2019;t use Unix paths in Uris, which broke us pretty early in the process. That was annoying, but expected for the time being, and while this issue (and other stuff we run into, I&#x2019;m only pointing this out as a simple example, nitpickers, don&#x2019;t get hang up on this) are surmountable, the major issue is that the CoreCLR require a lot more than just a few #ifdef, it require quite a lot of work. Probably restructuring the project (some dependencies are now nuget packages, different structure for projects and build system, etc). Therefor, what we intend to do now is wait a bit until the CoreCLR next release, probably September, and then start seeing what it takes to run RavenDB (both server &amp; client) under the CoreCLR on Windows. The idea is that we have much better tooling for working with .NET code on Windows, and hopefully the bulk of the work to actually run on the CoreCLR runtime there, then just deal with everything we need to run on Linux, and not have to worry about debugging the runtime as well. Now, to deal with the nitpickers: Mono is Open Source, you can fix any issues you find and submit pull requests.  That is correct, but let me talk about a few of the issues we have run into. The class library is partial / bad.&#xA0; I think that we would have done much better if we were building on Mono from the get go, we would know what pieces to avoid. But when a call to a ZipFile.Open will crash with SIGSEGV and no indication of why that is happening (ended up being stack overflow in the Mono BCL implementation), the fix was a single line but finding the root cause took a long while. With the actual runtime, a GC issue caused a segmentation fault, that took about a month to figure out. Now, we aren&#x2019;t expert in Mono. So when we got in trouble&#xA0; we reached out to the members in the Mono team, and were recommended a company that had the required expertise. I&#x2019;m very happy with the service provided by them, but the fact of the matter is, it took a month to narrow down a big problem to something that would be fixed by a couple of lines of code. Not because they weren&#x2019;t good, but because the problem was pretty tough to figure out. So we contributed some stuff back, and we would be happy to continue doing so if the process wasn&#x2019;t so hard (and quite expensive). Even relative simple issues had a very high threshold. The RavenDB codebase is close to a million lines of code. It is doing some pretty advanced stuff, and changing the foundation underneath it means that we invalidate a lot of silent assumptions. If the trivial stuff breaks so badly, I don&#x2019;t want to think about the cost of the really complex stuff. The GC issue was bad enough. If we were working from scratch, we would know what to avoid, but with such a big codebase, that isn&#x2019;t feasible. And again, even if we did manage to get it working properly, we still have the issue of how to support it. We provide production support to our customers, and the ability to accurately and quickly pinpoint problems and troubleshoot them is key. Taking on the support burden on Mono is very risky. Note that the worry I have isn&#x2019;t based around vague fears. The GC issue we had would cause random crashes, typically far after the relevant code would run, and only under very specific scenarios. In 99% of the cases, it would run just fine (well, not fine, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be crashing). A production system with this type of behavior would be a nightmare, even escalating to the Mono core team, figuring out where and how this is happening is nasty, and it won&#x2019;t happen in the time frames that we want to provide to customers who have production support contracts with us. What about the CoreCLR, it is Open Source too, why not contribute to it? The current plan, as I said, is to first see what it takes to move to the CoreCLR on Windows. That is a much smaller step, but it will let us get familiar both with the way the CoreCLR is structured and the new dependencies. We are actively looking at the project, and to say that I&#x2019;m excited is not nearly enough. This require a lot of work on our side, before we get to the point where we are actually getting to figure out if there is stuff that needs fixing there too. Once we have that, we are going to go back to Linux and get to working on running on a different OS, with all the implications of that. I&#x2019;m actually looking forward to this. That is the kind of problem that I want to tackle. If you want to look at the current state of our work (RavenDB on Linux using Mono), you can check it out here. We still have a full time developer for this, we are just going to divert him until the next beta of CoreCLR is out, and then we are going to restart the process as I described above.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A customer gave us a call about a failure they were experiencing in their production environment. They didn&#x2019;t install the license that they purchased for some reason, and when they tried to install that, RavenDB will not run. There is what this looked like:  Once I had all those details, it was pretty easy to figure out what was going on. I asked the client to send me the Raven.Server.exe.config file, just to verify it, and sure enough, here are the problematic lines:  &lt;add key=&quot;Raven/AnonymousAccess&quot; value=&quot;Admin&quot;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;add key=&quot;Raven/Licensing/AllowAdminAnonymousAccessForCommercialUse&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; /&gt;&#xA;This is the default configuration, and this failure is actually the expected and desired behavior. &#xA;What is going on? This customer was running RavenDB in a development mode, without a license. That means that the server is open to all. When you install a license, that is a pretty strong indication that you are using RavenDB in production. It is actually common to see users installing the development mode in production, and registering the license at a later date, for various reasons.&#xA;The problem with that is that this means that at least for a while, they were running with &#x201C;everyone is admin&#x201D; mode, which is great for development, but horrible for production. If you install RavenDB for production usage (by providing a license during the setup process), it will set itself up in locked down mode, so only users explicitly granted access can get to it. But if you started at development installation, then added the license&#x2026;&#xA;It is common for customers to forget or actually be unaware of that setting. And not setting it is going to end up with a production installation that is open to the whole wide world.&#xA;When that happens, that tend to be&#x2026; bad. Over 30,000 instances that are wide open bad.&#xA;Because of that, if you are running a license, and you had previously installed the development mode, you need to make a choice. Either you setup anonymous access so only authorized people can access the database, or you explicitly decided to grant everyone access, likely because you are already running in secured environment.&#xA;Error reporting from services is a bit hard, because there is no good way to send error messages to the service managers. But in the event log, we can see the actual error with the full details.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just finished writing the following code, the time is 2 AM local time, and I am chasing a conceptual issue deep in the guts of Voron (RavenDB&#x2019;s internal storage system).  By any measure of the word, this code should frighten anyone who reads it. For what I think can we can all safely assume are self evident reasons.  So why am I so very happy about this kind of code? Because the output of this code is this:  This is pretty trivial tree view for internal data structures inside of Voron. But the point here isn&#x2019;t that this code is probably going to be a no-go zone by tomorrow morning. This is code explicitly designed for that. In fact, the calling method for this is:  So this is a piece of code that we are trying very hard to ensure that will never be called unless we are actively requesting it in a debug session. In other words, this isn&#x2019;t production code. It is scaffolding code. The code that you&#x2019;ll call when you lost your way, and can no longer figure out what is going on using the standard tools. This kind of visualization is cheap &amp; dirty trick, but it means that instead of having to reason about this kind of thing, I can immediately see what is going on. For that matter, if you look closely at the visualization, you might be able to see the bug in question. It is pretty obvious, once we are able to look at the entire data set in one go. The more complex the algorithm, the harder it is to conceptualize it. But in most cases, if we could but look at the data in a way that would make sense to us, we will be able to immediately see what we did wrong.</p>
