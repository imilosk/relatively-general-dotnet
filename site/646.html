            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This article (The &#x27;Anti-Java&#x27; Professor and the Jobless Programmers) has really annoyed me. Not because of its content, but because the professor being interview is so narrowly focused that he is completely out of it.  Let us take this quote:     &#x201C;Furthermore, Java is mainly used in Web applications that are mostly fairly trivial,&#x201D; Dewar says, with his characteristic candor. &#x201C;If all we do is train students to be able to do simple Web programming in Java, they won&#x27;t get jobs, since those are the jobs that can be easily outsourced. What we need are software engineers who understand how to build complex systems.&#x201D;    You know what, I might agree with this, trivial web programming is something that doesn&#x27;t require highly skilled worker. But the context in which he says this makes all the difference in the world. Here is the next statement:     &#x201C;By the way Java has almost no presence in such systems. At least as of a few months ago, there was not a single line of safety-critical Java flying in commercial or military aircraft. I recently talked to a customer who had a medium-sized application in Java, which was to be adapted to be part of a safety-critical avionics system. They immediately decided that this meant it would have to be recoded in a suitable language, probably either C or Ada.&#x201D;    So, if it is not aircraft code, it is &quot;simple Web programming&quot;? Excuse me?!  Leaving aside the part about Java&#x27;s license not being suitable for life critical systems, it annoys me that this is the only criteria that he think is worth mentioning. His bank is running Java, as well as the stock exchange, it is likely that the payroll system in his university as well. Relegating Java to &quot;simple Web programming&quot; is a huge mistake. Java sweet spot is building complex systems, where a lot of the design decisions that make it hard to do the simple stuff pay off tremendously.  I can think of quite a few mission critical (people life on the balance) that are written in C# (for the purpose of this post, equivalent to Java). That is not to say that aircraft systems shouldn&#x27;t be written in Ada or C, I never written one, so I won&#x27;t comment, but to say that this is the only field of any complexity is showing a remarkable amount of ignorance and bigotry.  There was another part that caught my eye, this professor interviewing&#x27;s technique:     Dewar says that if he were interviewing applicants for a development job, he would quickly eliminate the under-trained by asking the following questions:     1.) You begin to suspect that a problem you are having is due to the compiler generating incorrect code. How would you track this down? How would you prepare a bug report for the compiler vendor? How would you work around the problem?     2.) You begin to suspect that a problem you are having is due to a hardware problem, where the processor is not conforming to its specification. How would you track this down? How would you prepare a bug report for the chip manufacturer, and how would you work around the problem?     &#x201C;I am afraid I would be met by blank stares from most recent CS graduates, many of whom have never seen assembly or machine language!&#x201D; he says   I can tell quite a lot about what he is doing, just by the questions he ask, but let me try answering them.  1) Well, I would start by creating an isolated test case, seeing if I can still see the odd behavior. I would remove all code that is even half way smart, trying to reduce the amount of work that the compiler has to do. I would get the language spec and pore over it, trying to make sure that I am not relying on unspecified behavior or misunderstanding the spec. Hopefully, I have a decompiler as well, since that would be an independent corroboration that there is or isn&#x27;t an issue. Then I would take the output and verify disassemble it, comparing it to what is supposed to happen. I will take that info and submit to the compiler vendor. Working around this issue... by now I have some understanding on what triggers it, so I would change the code accordingly, simplifying it, removing any smart tricks, etc. I&#x27;ll also leave a big comment about why this is done.  2) Try it on a different machine with the same processor, try it on another machine with a different processor. That rules problems with a specific machine and problems with my code, respectively. Reduce the problem to the smallest thing that can repro it, go over the spec, verify understanding. Eventually I should have a small program that demonstrate the issue. This can be incredibly hard to do if you run into something like memory barriers do not work in some scenario on SMP machines, for example. Work around it... depending on context...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am working on the versioning chapter for the DSL book, and it is going amazingly well. When I started it I had only the vaguest of idea how to go about writing it, but I wrote 10 pages today, and it is going very fast, and the flow seems to be good. What creeps me out is that I spent months thinking about this, without getting any concrete idea about how to express myself, and than it all flow at once.  The problem, of course, is that it doesn&#x27;t really flow into the book, here is my current blogging queue (unordered):     NHibernate Interception with Post Sharp    Entities dependencies best practices    Creating logging interceptor with Castle Windsor    Evaluating Prism    Usage scenarios for Cloud Computing    Evaluating Kym    Distributed Hash Tables: Locks usage best practices    Distributed Hash Tables: Locality    Distributed Hash Tables: Namespaces    Distributed Hash Tables: Time sensitive updates    Distributed Hash Tables: Lookup by property    Distributed Hash Tables: Lookup by range    Code Critique: Transactional Queue    Rhino Queues    Useless Java    A DSL trip to the Zoo    I&#x27;ll get to your application in a week- First, we need to build the framework    Production Quality: A DSL Sample   And I am probably forgetting a few along the way. Just getting this turned around would be hard enough, but I also have three webcasts that I need to record &amp; edit:     First Steps With Rhino Commons    Building Domain Specific Language with Boo    Production Quality Software   Way too much on my plate, I am going to bed.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post from Jeffrey Palermo has managed to distilled the reasons for a lot of things that I consider important.  From persistence ignorance to dependency injection.   To be rather more exact, Jeffrey has managed to put it in words in a way that I don&#x27;t think that I would have ever could.  Go and read it.  The concepts will probably not be earth shattering, but the ability to communicate clearly about this is very important.  &#xA0;  &#xA0;  &#xA0;  &#xA0;  .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The title says it all, I think. Okay, it doesn&#x27;t, I admit.  There is a lot of focus with DSL about the syntax. And there is some focus on the engine. There is very little focus about how both the environment and the usage of the DSL affect the DSL itself. Here are a few examples:     Naming convention    Script ordering    Execution location (when you are running the scripts)   All of those are of particular importance in many DSL, not only for the actual execution, but for how the DSL itself is written.</p>
