            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Continuing on the multi tenancy theme, let us talk about the actual physical structure of the data store. In general, you have two basic options.&#xA;&#xA;  The TenantId column and separated data stores. The TenantId is simply adding a column to all the columns, showing what tenant the row belongs to.&#xA;&#xA;  The separate data store calls for a much higher level of separation, where there is no shared storage for the tenants.&#xA;&#xA;There are variation on those, such as having separation in the schema level instead of DB level, etc, but they all end up being down to one of those choices.&#xA;The TenantId approach allows you to use a single DB for the entire application, potentially reducing costs for managing the environment. It is also the easiest to explain, we just filter by TenantId and that is it!&#xA;It comes with a whole set of problems that is related to that decision, however:&#xA;&#xA;  Isolation - You have to actively do filtering all the time. This has major issues on your code. And now, tacking TenantId = @CurrentTenant at each query is not going to be sufficient. Consider the case of joins in such an environment, you are likely to get a filter only on the end result, after it was joined already. And that is just one example.&#xA;&#xA;  Backup - The backup strategy that you have for this scenario sucks. Basically, you have to roll your own.&#xA;&#xA;  Customer copy of the data - Going back to the backup strategy? You can&#x27;t just hand the customer the backup. You have to dump the data out, and write something that writes it back in, and it has to be fast.&#xA;&#xA;  Security - you have to let all tenants access the data, security is in the app logic level.&#xA;&#xA;  Extensibility - in a shared environment it is hard to do a lot of extensibility in the data, because each client is stepping on each other toes.&#xA;&#xA;As you probably gathered, I strongly suggest going with the separate model. Now our management strategy is dealing with the connection string. Isolation is built in and doesn&#x27;t require any , for backup you have the vendor tools, and giving the customer its own data is trivial, just send him the backup file. Security is easy, a tenant can access only their DB, and extending this is much easier, because each tenant has their own walled garden to play with.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note: the last time I did even an off the cuff review of a Microsoft application, the whole CAB argument was born. I am writing this statement before looking at the code, mind you, so I have no idea what the review will be.   For a change, let us start by talking about the documentation, which I am reading while the code is downloading.   Multi-Tenant Data Architecture is a very interesting read, I agree to most of what they are saying there, just not with the way they are pushing things and the conclusions they are trying to draw. In particular, we have this graph, showing the economic difference between shared vs. isolated approaches.     I have no idea where they go that data from, or what it is based on. From what I have seen, it is more like this:     And I didn&#x27;t include a whole bunch of stuff that makes shared approach a really bad idea, like the required security audits, risks on data dependencies in shared data, etc.  On to the application itself. This time, I started from the UI, moving inward. In the BasePage, the master page is set according to the tenant alias. There is also the tenant id, but it is very rarely used.  Item of interest, ISitkaSoapService, which is a WCF service that is used for such things as CRUD, will happily accept SQL from the user. I&#x27;ll not even try to talk about the validations that they have there, accepting SQL from the client is a mistake unless you are an DB Server. And that is at the architecture level.  I went a little bit deeper, but at some point (around 03:30 AM) I decided that I am not getting to get anything new from this, and there isn&#x27;t much of a point in posting a code review for that.  Oh, and just to make things more interesting, LitwareHR is not a multi tenant application by my definition. It is an application that can handle data from several clients, and it have skinning, but that about it. Yes, it has the idea of tacking fields to an entity, that is about as close as it gets to what I would consider multi tenancy.  What it is, in my eyes, is just a normal application, with a need for dynamic fields, that is. Show me different behavior across tenants, different entities. And by that I don&#x27;t mean just Customer &#x2B; Comtoso.FriendlyName, I am talking about something that actually does something with the extra data, rather than just display it.     Note: After reading this post, I had seriously considered not publishing it, see the CAB episode for reference on why. I decided to publish it anyway, see CAB episode for why.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The question just came up in the NHibernate dev list, and I wanted to be as clear about this as possible.&#xA;If you can at all avoid it, do so. The use of SQL in NHibernate should be strongly discouraged. It is there to give you the ability to use the proprietary features of your database, and as a way to avoid the abstraction if you really need that.&#xA;The problem is when people are using that for things that they really shouldn&#x27;t, like complex queries that they know how to express in SQL but not using NHibernate, so they drop to that. This is not what it is for, and it will bite you later.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Wikipedia defines Multi Tenancy as:&#xA;&#xA;  Multitenancy refers to the architectural principle, where a single instance of the software runs on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) vendor&#x27;s servers, serving multiple client organizations (tenants). Multitenancy is contrasted with a multi-instance architecture where separate software instances (or hardware systems) are set up for different client organizations. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration so that each client organization works with a customized virtual application instance.&#xA;&#xA;My definition of multi tenant includes a single instance service multiple tenants and multiple instances, one for each tenant. In fact, it would also include the idea of a product line as well. Or, like I like to think about it, perhaps it is product lines that are used in multi tenant scenarios.&#xA;Let us start from the beginning. We have a need for building an application that can handle several tenant. A typical example would be Invoicing System that we can sell to different clients. Note that I explicitly don&#x27;t care in this scenario how the application is deployed. It may be at the client site, hosted in as multi instance or single instance. The only thing that is important in this scenario is that the application is the same for all tenants.&#xA;That is, they have no, or very little, customizations options. By customizations I don&#x27;t mean having the ability to change the logo or the skin, but true customization. Changing the way the system behaves, extending the domain, adding more UI, adding more behavior, editing existing behavior, etc.&#xA;If you don&#x27;t have customization, then you really have very little issue, you can take a standard application and deal with the tenants as purely infrastructure concern (yes, I know that you need a bit more control than that, but bear with me).&#xA;If you do need this customization behavior, then it doesn&#x27;t matter what your deployment strategy is, the important issue is that you have to support multiple parallel customizations to your application, including the ability to extend the model and override the application behavior. And that is applicable for product lines as well as multi tenant applications.&#xA;As it turn out, there isn&#x27;t a lot of actual challenge in making such an application once you have an IoC in place, you can trivially change services and model without any issues. The problems are with the extension strategy, customization management, tenant management and conventions emplacement and enforcements.&#xA;I am going to talk some more about this in the future, but that will go down into the gory details and will be a real zoo.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">No, I am not going to talk about how to design a system, I am going to take it as granted that you are aware on all the traditional checklists for good design and are actively applying them. What I wold like to talk about are the parts that a lot of people tend to forget until they find out about it after the system is already at the hands of the users.&#xA;I am going to talk about Rhino Security as an example to that. The predecessor for Rhino Security was a proprietary piece of software that worked on top of some incredibly confusing set of business rules. (You may not see a product vNext if you have a contract for vPrev in the last year over some dollar value, as an example). Rhino Security&#x27;s design was heavily influenced by that project, including the inclusion, as a first level concept, of the &quot;explain the reasons for this security decision&quot;. The hours I spent debugging the security system only to find out that it was absolutely correct has thought me that much, if nothing else.&#xA;So the hooks for make the system understandable are built in, they are explicit and the design and are a major advantage when it comes the time to implement, experiment and deploy the system.&#xA;Another important concern is handling errors, logging, tracing and alerts are all important concepts. Do you have a backup procedure? Do it have a way to SHOUT that the backup have failed? Do you have scheduled jobs? Do you get NOTIFIED when they do? (A lot of the problem in software occur when a scheduled job hasn&#x27;t been running for three months straight)&#xA;You ask the system to do some operation. In any sort of non trivial system, figuring out why it reached this decision is as important, if not more so, than the decision / operation made. Do you plan for that? Logging isn&#x27;t it. I am talking about planing for that at the infrastructure and operation levels, exposing this as a first level ability/feature in the user interface and making this visible. Give the user control over what the system is doing. You&#x27;ll find that the level of understanding that they gain from it will enable them to get a far higher productivity.&#xA;As an aside, it is extremely helpful in troubleshooting, but that is beside the point.&#xA;Is your system stable? Stable in the sense that new features don&#x27;t break old ones, that deploying a new version is a straightforward process. Stable in the sense that the approaches you take in the beginning of the project are stable enough to last the lifetime of the project (another way of putting this, avoid hacks in the infrastructure).&#xA;The development environment. Have you given it any thought? Do you have a well defined process for developing new functionality? (Well defined process == you have thought it out, not documented it in excruciating details). Did you consider the source control story? Did you consider the ability to split the system into independent parts?&#xA;Versioning concerns - do you need to run in a multi version environment? Do you need to support just upgrade from old version?&#xA;Tracing / auditing - this is BAM, but I don&#x27;t like the term. Do you have the ability to see what the system is doing?&#xA;As you can see, we have a few separate grouping here. One is visibility and transparency of the system, second is operational issues, and last is the developer environment story. I find that all too often people are ignoring those issues completely, in favor of complete focus on architecture and application design. Those are important, but they are only part of the story.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">That was the first thing out of my mouth when I saw a diagram the day before yesterday. The diagram was of a domain model and included four entities.&#xA;No, I can&#x27;t see the future and extrapolate from customer/order/order lines whatever the system is going to scale or not. I wasn&#x27;t talking about the system scalability at all. I was thinking of using the diagram as the main means for expressing concepts. A single diagram is just not a good solution for showing any sort of a complex concept. At that particular case, the diagram is a view on top of a model, so the issue wasn&#x27;t really relevant,&#xA;It did, however, made me think about my use of scalable. I make the word work for its living, because for me, it means:&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable traditional - can we make the system handle more operations&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable complexity - when we increase the complexity of the problem, do we need to increase the complexity of the solution by the same amount, by doubling or tripling the complexity?&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable maintainability - how much work do I need to do in order to maintain this application? Is the work required going to rapidly increase over time?&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable size - as the project grow, do I have the facilities for it? That means, can I split the work between developers / teams? Will VS become extremely slow with huge amount of projects? Do I have an SCM strategy planned.&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable management - as the project grow, how are we going to manage that?&#xA;&#xA;  Scalable IT - as the project grows, do we have the tooling in place to actually understand the application in production. Remote Debugging doesn&#x27;t work.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got an assistance request for Rhino Mocks directly to my email about forty minutes go. As usual, and as outlined here, I asked that the question be sent to the relevant mailing list. I get a lot of such requests, and that it my standard response for most of them, when they are on the list, other people have a shot at that, and the answer is a searchable record. If you want to something more, we can discuss my rates.  Anyway, I am getting of lot of such requests, and I am perfectly fine with redirecting them to the mailing list. But twenty minutes after I replied to the first email, another one got into my inbox. Same guy, same question.    He got the same reply, as you can see.  Just to make this clear, I welcome questions and discussions, I currently (as in, today) carry ~7 of them from people who just thought they could ask me a question. But I might as well decide that I am not interested in having a discussion in private email, and ask to turn that to the relevant mailing list. It mostly depends on how interesting is the question. So feel free to contact me if you have something you want to talk about, but do consider that the mailing lists are usually a better place for that and I might turn you that way anyway.   And no, I don&#x27;t intend to make a habit of putting annoying people on the blog. And yes, it took me longer to write this blog post than it would have to answer the question.</p>

The problem has nothing to do with technical issues, and all to do with management issues. The code above makes a certain modification to the current state of the system, but it doesn&#x27;t tell us why!  Consider the case where we have several hundreds (or thousands) of those rules.&#xA0; How are you going to associate the end result of executing all those rules with the actual rule that caused a particular issue? How are you going to know why?  For a well defined DSL, we need more than just the syntax, we need an environment that supports the whole development process, and that includes being able to give good answers during runtime, about what caused what and why. Some of that are things that you can add to the syntax, that is, you can write is as:     specification @vacations: &#xA;&#x9;requires @scheduling_work, &quot;Vacations requires work scheduling so we can plan around vacations&quot;&#xA;&#x9;requires @external_connections, &quot;We need to order vacation spots&quot;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Note: I don&#x27;t want to hear about the ridiculousness of the business example, I know it is. It is here as an example for something else, not the actual business logic.&#xA;&#xA;But this still doesn&#x27;t give you enough information, the DSL engine itself needs to record the information about what rule (and what script) had modified the state of the application, and allow you to just directly from the result to the rule that allowed it.&#xA;&#xA;Otherwise, what you have is chaos.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that always bothered me with Linq was that it is actually not an interesting idea from the compiler perspective. I just had to implement a very simple expression to expression tree converter, which only served to strengthen my opinion. Here is the (ugly, proof of concept, horrible) implementation, using the Boo AST:     private static Block Linqify(Expression expr)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;var block = new Block(expr.LexicalInfo);&#xA;&#x9;ReferenceExpression condition = AddCondition(block);&#xA;&#x9;Parse(block, condition, expr);&#xA;&#x9;block.Add(new ReturnStatement(condition));&#xA;&#x9;return block;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;private static ReferenceExpression AddCondition(Block block)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;var condition = new MethodInvocationExpression(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Condition&quot;));&#xA;&#x9;var expression = new ReferenceExpression(&quot;condition_&quot; &#x2B; CompilerContext.Current.AllocIndex());&#xA;&#x9;block.Add(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;new BinaryExpression(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;BinaryOperatorType.Assign,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;expression,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;condition)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;);&#xA;&#x9;return expression;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;private static void Parse(Block block, Expression condition, Expression expr)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;var be = expr as BinaryExpression;&#xA;&#x9;if (be != null &amp;&amp; (be.Operator == BinaryOperatorType.Or || be.Operator == BinaryOperatorType.And))&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;block.Add(new BinaryExpression(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;BinaryOperatorType.Assign,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new MemberReferenceExpression(condition, &quot;Operator&quot;),&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new StringLiteralExpression(be.Operator.ToString().ToLowerInvariant()))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ReferenceExpression left = AddCondition(block);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;block.Add(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new MethodInvocationExpression(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new MemberReferenceExpression(new MemberReferenceExpression(condition, &quot;Expressions&quot;), &quot;Add&quot;), left));&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ReferenceExpression right = AddCondition(block);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;block.Add(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new MethodInvocationExpression(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new MemberReferenceExpression(new MemberReferenceExpression(condition, &quot;Expressions&quot;), &quot;Add&quot;), right));&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Parse(block, left, be.Left);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Parse(block, right, be.Right);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;var fragment = new MethodInvocationExpression(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Fragment&quot;));&#xA;&#x9;if (expr is UnaryExpression)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;fragment.NamedArguments.Add(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new ExpressionPair(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Modifier&quot;),&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new StringLiteralExpression(&quot;not&quot;))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;be = (BinaryExpression)((UnaryExpression)expr).Operand;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;var func1 = (MethodInvocationExpression)be.Left;&#xA;&#x9;fragment.NamedArguments.Add(new ExpressionPair(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Func1&quot;), new StringLiteralExpression(func1.Target.ToString())));&#xA;&#x9;fragment.NamedArguments.Add(new ExpressionPair(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Prop1&quot;), GetStringArgument(func1.Arguments[0])));&#xA;&#x9;var func2 = be.Right as MethodInvocationExpression;&#xA;&#x9;if (func2 != null)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;fragment.NamedArguments.Add(new ExpressionPair(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Func2&quot;), new StringLiteralExpression(func2.Target.ToString())));&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;fragment.NamedArguments.Add(new ExpressionPair(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Prop2&quot;), GetStringArgument(func2.Arguments[0])));&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;else&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;fragment.NamedArguments.Add(new ExpressionPair(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Func2&quot;), new StringLiteralExpression(&quot;literal&quot;)));&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;fragment.NamedArguments.Add(new ExpressionPair(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Prop2&quot;), GetStringArgument(be.Right)));&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;fragment.NamedArguments.Add(new ExpressionPair(new ReferenceExpression(&quot;Operator&quot;),&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;new StringLiteralExpression(GetOperator(be))));&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;block.Add(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;new MethodInvocationExpression(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;new MemberReferenceExpression(new MemberReferenceExpression(condition, &quot;Expressions&quot;), &quot;Add&quot;), fragment));&#xA;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;private static Expression GetStringArgument(Expression expr)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;if (expr is StringLiteralExpression)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return expr;&#xA;&#x9;return new StringLiteralExpression(expr.ToString());&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;private static string GetOperator(BinaryExpression be)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;switch (be.Operator)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;case BinaryOperatorType.Equality:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;==&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;case BinaryOperatorType.Inequality:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;!=&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;case BinaryOperatorType.Member:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;in&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;case BinaryOperatorType.LessThan:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;&lt;&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;case BinaryOperatorType.LessThanOrEqual:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;&lt;=&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;case BinaryOperatorType.GreaterThan:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;&gt;&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;case BinaryOperatorType.GreaterThanOrEqual:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;&gt;=&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;default:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;throw new NotSupportedException(be.Operator.ToString());&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This takes a Boo expression and transform that into the code that creates an object model that represents this expression. Linq is simply an extension to this implementation.</p>
