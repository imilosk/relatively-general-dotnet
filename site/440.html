        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the oft repeated objections to using NHibernate is that there isn&#x2019;t someone that you can officially complain to. Some organizations put great store in having someone to officially complain to :-).   The NHibernate community, especially the NHibernate Users mailing list is active and thriving, and a large percentage of the support questions that you may have can be answered there, for free.  However, there are situations where you really do want to have someone to call to get you out of the foxhole. And there are organizations that will not accept a technology unless they have a support contract.  I mentioned before that my company is providing commercial NHibernate support, but so far it has always been on a case by case basis, and mostly by request. I am happy to announce that we are now offering a Commercial Support option for NHibernate.  If that has been a challenge for adopting NHibernate, or if you find yourself struggling with NHibernate and require assistance beyond what the community will provide, you have additional options.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here are two examples of two apps doing the same thing, using drastically different UI paradigm.           As you can see, TwitterDeck is using a multi column approach while Twhirl uses a single column approach. When I saw TwitterDeck, I loved it. It looked like I would have all the information I need right where I wanted it. And being able to add searches as columns looked exciting.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x2019;t take a long time to see that there are some distinct disadvantages to seeing all of that information in front of me all the time.  There are a few things that drive me crazy with TwitterDeck that Twhirl just solves:  Information doesn&#x2019;t expire  I don&#x2019;t get all that many direct messages, for example, but a direct message from Glenn from three weeks ago has the same level of importance as a reply from 5 minutes ago.  Time isn&#x2019;t explicit  Look at the way Twhirl and TwitterDeck represent time. TwitterDeck shows it as a date, while Twhirl display a duration. I don&#x2019;t want to figure out when I try to figure out when someone posted something. Just answer my question already!  Don&#x2019;t make me think  When Twhirl detect a URL in a twit, it automatically shorten it. TwitterDeck has a specialized text box for that. It means another step along the way.  There is one thing about TwitterDeck that I would love to see in Twhirl, and that is to be able to subscribe to searches. But again, results from a month ago are not required.   Twhirl&#x2019;s model of a flow of information represent information in a way that is much more consumable to me.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am on a new machine right now, and I had Bing set as the default search engine. I wanted to install TwitterDeck, so I search for it, and got this as a result:     Can you say totally useless? Trying the same thing in Google brought me this:     First result on Google brought me the right thing that I wanted. I have no idea how long I would have to go with Bing to find what I want, and I don&#x2019;t care. Google get it, 99% of the time. Even for the crazy stuff (a blog post from four years ago I remember a particular phrase from).  The problem with Bing is that it bring a lot of results that are associated with the actual search term. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that it understand what I mean and how to deal with it.  I am not sure if I am making much sense here, but I hope that the difference is clear. Getting a lot of results in fairly easy. Getting the right results is the thing that makes Google the King of the Search.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There seems to be some confusion regarding my post about soft deletes, in particular, people brought up the idea of append only models.  I had the chance to work on both types of systems, and I can tell you that I would much rather work with append only model than with soft deletes. The append only model means that you can only ever insert, never delete or update.  Thing about the way your bank account works. If I had the clerk transfer money from one account to another, and he had a typo and send tens times the amount that I wanted, the bank will not &#x201C;delete&#x201D; the transaction. What will happen is that there will be a separate transaction, canceling the first one.   There are several reasons for going with this approach, which Jim has brought up in his post:          automatic audit logging, since nothing is ever UPDATE&#x27;d or DELETE&#x27;d, you&#x27;ve got a constant trail of changes      automatic support for infinite undo/roll-back support of data, as you simply load a prior version and then save as usual      automatic support for labeling of versions, much like in source/version control systems, at an individual record level, table level, &quot;aggregate root level&quot;, or database level      automatic support for &quot;back querying&quot; a system, in search of what the situation looked like last month, last year, etc. (though raising this &quot;aspect&quot;, as in AOP, to the ORM level would be crucial)      As I said, this makes things much simpler from a lot of aspects. It does mean that you have a more complex data model (because all associations are now using: Id &#x2B; max(version) ), but that is manageable.  But, as I said, there is a distinct difference between that and soft deletes. Soft deletes, as I refer to them, portend to IsDeleted columns that perform a logical deletion in the database. I don&#x2019;t really like those, and I explained my reasoning in my previous post.  Append Only models represent some complexity with regards to managing things, but in general, they force you to think in a very different fashion than CUD models. For one thing, you are almost always going to have a different reporting model, instead of trying to query the append only model directly (which gets to be complicated).  There is one thing that I want to emphasis, using Append Only model should be reflected in your API. Trying to abstract that away is going to lead to a world of pain.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was quite surprised to hear that SQL Azure has a 10 GB limit for each database. That drastically reduce the amount of effort that I guess SQL Azure takes. At a guess, I would say it is simply replicated instances of databases instead of real SQL on the cloud.  One of the nice premises of working on the cloud is that you get transparent scaling. 10GB limit is not transparent. The answer from Microsoft seems to be that you need to implement Sharding. That is, you spread your logical database over several physical databases.  Usually it is done on physical database instances for the purpose of speeding up application because you get can parallelize the queries. In this case, you would need this because each database is pretty small.  Sharding is a term that was invented by Google, and a few years ago several Google engineers decided that they want to use Sharding with Hibernate. Thus, the Hibernate Shards project was born, bringing transparent sharding support to Hibernate.  The equivalent project for NHibernate was started, but porting was never complete. This is a call for volunteers to help continue the port of Hibernate Shards to NHibernate. You now have a very clear goal for why you would want that.  Having NHibernate Shards fully functional would mean that you get transparent scaling on SQL Azure. The fun part is that there isn&#x2019;t a lot of thinking or design involved, the road was already traveled by, the only effort would be porting it.  And, to give some incentive, I am willing to donate an NH Prof license for all the major contributors that would finish the Hibernate Shards port.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A while ago I was contacted by a friend who asked me if I am offering a commercial version of Rhino Mocks.  That is not a mistake, he was working in a place where the use of Open Source Software was not allowed, and decided that the simplest way to use the tool was to go through the normal route, buy it.   I wholeheartedly support this decision. :-)  Considering how hard it is to make some organizations use Open Source projects, and how used those same organizations to buying software, it is probably the right decision. It make things much simpler, and you are actually supporting OSS along the way.  At any rate, if you find yourself in the same position, you can just go and buy Rhino Mocks.  The retail version and the OSS version are&#x2026; well, look at the title, then figure it out.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The scenario for this is to create a locking mechanism in a Distributed Hash Table where nodes are allowed to fail without taking the entire DHT down.  Now, don&#x2019;t expect too much out of this, I thought this out at 2 AM or so, and just sat down to hurriedly write it before it escape my mind.  The environment in which it runs is a DHT, where a key may reside on several nodes (usually 1 or 3).&#xA0; Taking a look means placing a lock item in over half of the nodes. Lock expires after a set amount of time (because we can&#x2019;t trust the client to clear them). We assume a system that share a clock (or synchronize clocks).  The annoying thing is that we need to recover from situations in which some of the nodes holding the key are down or inaccessible.   Here is the pseudo code:          def LockKey(key, recursionDepth) as bool:    topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)    successfulLocks = 0    lockExpiry = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(1)    lockKey = key&#x2B;&quot;_lock&quot;    for server in topology:        try:            server.WriteIfDoesNotExistsOrSameServer(lockKey, currentServerName, lockExpiry)            successfulLocks &#x2B;= 1        except ServerDown:            ignore error        except KeyAlreadyExists:            if ScavengeExpiredLocks(lockKey):                return LockKey(key, recursionDepth&#x2B;1) if recursionDepth &lt; 3            return false&#xA;&#xA;        return (successfulLocks/2) &gt;= (topology.Count/2) //at least half the servers have the lock&#xA;&#xA;    def ScavengeExpiredLocks(key):    topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)    for server in topology:       try:           val = server.ReadKey(lockKey)           if HasExpired(val):                server.RemoveKey(lock, val.Version)           else:                return false       except ServerDown:           ignore error       except KeyVersionChanged:           return false          return true        def ClearLock(key):  topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)  for server in topology:     try:         val = server.ReadKey(lockKey)         if BelongsToCurrentServer(val):              server.RemoveKey(lock, val.Version)     except ServerDown:         ignore error     except KeyVersionChanged:         ignore error&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;So, how many critical bugs do I have here?</p>
