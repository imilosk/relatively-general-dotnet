            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am on a new machine right now, and I had Bing set as the default search engine. I wanted to install TwitterDeck, so I search for it, and got this as a result:     Can you say totally useless? Trying the same thing in Google brought me this:     First result on Google brought me the right thing that I wanted. I have no idea how long I would have to go with Bing to find what I want, and I don&#x2019;t care. Google get it, 99% of the time. Even for the crazy stuff (a blog post from four years ago I remember a particular phrase from).  The problem with Bing is that it bring a lot of results that are associated with the actual search term. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that it understand what I mean and how to deal with it.  I am not sure if I am making much sense here, but I hope that the difference is clear. Getting a lot of results in fairly easy. Getting the right results is the thing that makes Google the King of the Search.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There seems to be some confusion regarding my post about soft deletes, in particular, people brought up the idea of append only models.  I had the chance to work on both types of systems, and I can tell you that I would much rather work with append only model than with soft deletes. The append only model means that you can only ever insert, never delete or update.  Thing about the way your bank account works. If I had the clerk transfer money from one account to another, and he had a typo and send tens times the amount that I wanted, the bank will not &#x201C;delete&#x201D; the transaction. What will happen is that there will be a separate transaction, canceling the first one.   There are several reasons for going with this approach, which Jim has brought up in his post:          automatic audit logging, since nothing is ever UPDATE&#x27;d or DELETE&#x27;d, you&#x27;ve got a constant trail of changes      automatic support for infinite undo/roll-back support of data, as you simply load a prior version and then save as usual      automatic support for labeling of versions, much like in source/version control systems, at an individual record level, table level, &quot;aggregate root level&quot;, or database level      automatic support for &quot;back querying&quot; a system, in search of what the situation looked like last month, last year, etc. (though raising this &quot;aspect&quot;, as in AOP, to the ORM level would be crucial)      As I said, this makes things much simpler from a lot of aspects. It does mean that you have a more complex data model (because all associations are now using: Id &#x2B; max(version) ), but that is manageable.  But, as I said, there is a distinct difference between that and soft deletes. Soft deletes, as I refer to them, portend to IsDeleted columns that perform a logical deletion in the database. I don&#x2019;t really like those, and I explained my reasoning in my previous post.  Append Only models represent some complexity with regards to managing things, but in general, they force you to think in a very different fashion than CUD models. For one thing, you are almost always going to have a different reporting model, instead of trying to query the append only model directly (which gets to be complicated).  There is one thing that I want to emphasis, using Append Only model should be reflected in your API. Trying to abstract that away is going to lead to a world of pain.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was quite surprised to hear that SQL Azure has a 10 GB limit for each database. That drastically reduce the amount of effort that I guess SQL Azure takes. At a guess, I would say it is simply replicated instances of databases instead of real SQL on the cloud.  One of the nice premises of working on the cloud is that you get transparent scaling. 10GB limit is not transparent. The answer from Microsoft seems to be that you need to implement Sharding. That is, you spread your logical database over several physical databases.  Usually it is done on physical database instances for the purpose of speeding up application because you get can parallelize the queries. In this case, you would need this because each database is pretty small.  Sharding is a term that was invented by Google, and a few years ago several Google engineers decided that they want to use Sharding with Hibernate. Thus, the Hibernate Shards project was born, bringing transparent sharding support to Hibernate.  The equivalent project for NHibernate was started, but porting was never complete. This is a call for volunteers to help continue the port of Hibernate Shards to NHibernate. You now have a very clear goal for why you would want that.  Having NHibernate Shards fully functional would mean that you get transparent scaling on SQL Azure. The fun part is that there isn&#x2019;t a lot of thinking or design involved, the road was already traveled by, the only effort would be porting it.  And, to give some incentive, I am willing to donate an NH Prof license for all the major contributors that would finish the Hibernate Shards port.</p>

Hat tip for Microsoft for managing to create an environment so similar to that of SQL Server under a drastically different conditions.  * The only caveat is that some Schema Export scripts fails on SQL Azure, it seems like drop table has some slightly different behavior with SQL Azure, it does not drop the table immediately, but there seems to be some delay before it actually happens (especially if you use a different connection to check for the existence of the table).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A while ago I was contacted by a friend who asked me if I am offering a commercial version of Rhino Mocks.  That is not a mistake, he was working in a place where the use of Open Source Software was not allowed, and decided that the simplest way to use the tool was to go through the normal route, buy it.   I wholeheartedly support this decision. :-)  Considering how hard it is to make some organizations use Open Source projects, and how used those same organizations to buying software, it is probably the right decision. It make things much simpler, and you are actually supporting OSS along the way.  At any rate, if you find yourself in the same position, you can just go and buy Rhino Mocks.  The retail version and the OSS version are&#x2026; well, look at the title, then figure it out.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The scenario for this is to create a locking mechanism in a Distributed Hash Table where nodes are allowed to fail without taking the entire DHT down.  Now, don&#x2019;t expect too much out of this, I thought this out at 2 AM or so, and just sat down to hurriedly write it before it escape my mind.  The environment in which it runs is a DHT, where a key may reside on several nodes (usually 1 or 3).&#xA0; Taking a look means placing a lock item in over half of the nodes. Lock expires after a set amount of time (because we can&#x2019;t trust the client to clear them). We assume a system that share a clock (or synchronize clocks).  The annoying thing is that we need to recover from situations in which some of the nodes holding the key are down or inaccessible.   Here is the pseudo code:          def LockKey(key, recursionDepth) as bool:    topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)    successfulLocks = 0    lockExpiry = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(1)    lockKey = key&#x2B;&quot;_lock&quot;    for server in topology:        try:            server.WriteIfDoesNotExistsOrSameServer(lockKey, currentServerName, lockExpiry)            successfulLocks &#x2B;= 1        except ServerDown:            ignore error        except KeyAlreadyExists:            if ScavengeExpiredLocks(lockKey):                return LockKey(key, recursionDepth&#x2B;1) if recursionDepth &lt; 3            return false&#xA;&#xA;        return (successfulLocks/2) &gt;= (topology.Count/2) //at least half the servers have the lock&#xA;&#xA;    def ScavengeExpiredLocks(key):    topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)    for server in topology:       try:           val = server.ReadKey(lockKey)           if HasExpired(val):                server.RemoveKey(lock, val.Version)           else:                return false       except ServerDown:           ignore error       except KeyVersionChanged:           return false          return true        def ClearLock(key):  topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)  for server in topology:     try:         val = server.ReadKey(lockKey)         if BelongsToCurrentServer(val):              server.RemoveKey(lock, val.Version)     except ServerDown:         ignore error     except KeyVersionChanged:         ignore error&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;So, how many critical bugs do I have here?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been using Git for the past week or so, enough to get a good handle on its benefits and disadvantages.  I moved to Git from Subversion, after having done a stint of almost 6 years of using Subversion. A stint which also included doing some development on Subversion.  Despite appearances, I actually took a fairly structured (and long running) approach to learning Git, I got a book and read it, I played around with it, and I mostly dismissed it as &#x201C;it isn&#x2019;t solving my problem&#x201D; and &#x201C;I already know how source control works&#x201D;.  Last week I had the chance to pick Aaron Jensen mind about Git, and he was able to clear up some conceptual issues about how Git operates. I made a bigger effort since to learn how I can make better use of Git and I think that I now know enough to be able to talk about it.  First, let me talk about Subversion a little bit. As I said, I am a long time user of Subversion, and I consider it an excellent source control system. It is, however, strongly aimed at meeting corporate development scenarios.  What do I mean by that? In Subversion, you have the root repository, and everything else falls out from there. That doesn&#x2019;t sounds like such a problem, until you realize that except for your local working copy, every single operation is a remote operation.  Just to give you an idea why this is a problem, looking up a history of changes (including file diffs) is a real pain in Subversion. Merging (the actual act, not keeping track of it) is a pretty long operation as well.  That was the final deal breaker for me. I feel insulted whenever I have to wait for the machine, it should be the other way around, damn it!  But there are other issues with Subversion usage, specifically, for Open Source projects I don&#x2019;t believe that the centralized model works anymore.  Consider the workflow for getting a patch in Rhino Mocks. You get the code, make the patch, send the patch. In the meantime, the project is moving ahead and you are forced to keep up with what is basically a dirty and unversioned working copy.  Worse, for me, when you send me the patch, it has to go back to the server for any old versions (slow! slow! slow!) and make me do a lot of the work.  Having a single source of truth is important, for official releases. But in the meantime, I like the idea of having multiple disparate copies that people are working on independently. They should.  Some other important thoughts, with absolutely no order:     Local history is another major important aspect. I mentioned that this is something that I sometimes do, and it is a total pain to go through that with Subversion, and it totally painless to do so with Git. I have TortoiseGit installed specifically for that, so I get a UI that I am very familiar with but with no network round tripping time.     I am not sure how to qualify this point, but it feels like Git is faster even when it does goes on the network. Project checkouts and remote commits seems to be faster. Even though on the face of it Subversion should be much faster at least for checkouts (Git gets the entire history, Subversion gets a single revision).     People keep mentioning having private commits as an advantage. I guess I see the point, but I am not sold on that yet. Sure, it is fun to be able to do that, but this is a paper advantage so far. What I really do like is that commits are fast. Which means that in many cases I can commit &amp; push on the background while resuming work.    Github is another consideration, its major advantage is that it is taking care of a lot of details related to actually managing git.   For open source work, I love looking at this:     This gives me a good indication about the actual interest in a project.   Other things, like pull requests and their management makes me tingle all over, since they represent how people actually work in OSS project in real life and this represent a significant time saving.  There are other stuff as well, having a download button in the site means that I don&#x2019;t get questions from people that have no Subversion tools or are behind firewalls.  Github is also a huge disadvantage since in less than a week I caught it broken at least twice. There are some things that I want to be stable, the place where I put my source code is one of them, and I don&#x2019;t care if the unstable parts aren&#x2019;t the Git repositories. As far as I am concerned, unstable site equals to nervousness on my part.  Anyway, those are my reasons for moving to Git. The tooling are pretty good, I got used to the git command line, gitk and git gui fairly quickly.</p>
