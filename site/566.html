            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the nice things about NH Prof is the way that it is setup from an infrastructure stand point. Take a look at the following email:     I got this email, along with an additional one containing the actual crash information (this email is generated from the user&#x2019;s input about the reason for NH Prof crashing).  This isn&#x2019;t the first time that I get this bug (it is an annoying threading issue) but this time I was able to finally pinpoint the exact place where this is happening, trace it back to where it is used and get to the slap-fore-head-OMG-I-am-stupid moment.  Then it was adding a few locks, refactoring to make it clean, and commit.  At this point, my work is done. We have a CI infrastructure that will compile everything, run the tests and push it out as a released build.  With NH Prof, we take the stance that every single commit is a release. Sometimes we will do some work on branches, but most of the work is done on the trunk, and any commit to the trunk result in a new released build.  Out of close to 400 builds that we have so far, I believe that we had about 5 &#x2013; 10 lemons (builds that fail on user&#x2019;s machines). In all cases, it was fixed within a few hours.  The implications for me are huge. I don&#x2019;t have to worry about managing things. I set it up once (sometimes in December or November, if I recall correctly) and stopped worrying about releasing stuff.  And it means that I can literally fix a bug, commit and tell the user that they can pick up the changes as soon as it is done.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I intentionally don&#x2019;t intend to give out enough information about this problem, I want to see what your opinion is.  I have an application where a certain action invalidate some of the data that the user is shown. It is quite expensive to recalculate that data, so we can&#x2019;t just recalculate it right then and there, and in many cases, it will be the exact same data as the user is currently shown.  The question is, what should we do with this data?     Ignore the&#xA0; invalidation and just show the (possibly invalid) data to the user until the application refresh itself normally.    Remove the data all together. However, the lack of the data is already meaningful in the application.    Put some notification that the data is invalid.   I have my own opinions, but I would like to hear what you think we should do&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a story from a recent planning meeting that we had. One of the developers was explaining how he is implementing a certain feature, and he went over a potential problem that we would have. That problem is a potential one, because it would only show up if we extend the project in a certain direction, which isn&#x2019;t currently planned.  My response for that was: &#x201C;Let the users submit a bug report for that if it happens&#x201D;.  It is a cruder form of YAGNI.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is merely a simple observation. I had a chance to talk with a few people recently, and I heard something that really bothered me. Sadly, this is not a new thing, but it is still extremely annoying and disrespectful.  Basically, the problem is that concerns that are being brought up are dismissed as unrealistic, idealist and non workable in the real world. The people who bring up those concerns are also dismissed as radical tree huggers with no concept of how to build things in the field.  The reason that I think this is stupid, insulting and disrespectful is that a lot of the people bringing up those concerns are real world practitioners. It is more than just merely annoying to hear that.  Calling a raised problem an idealist issue or a perfectionist problem is an eventual guarantee that the feedback and concerns being brought up will dry up. And that the next feedback received will be in terms that aren&#x2019;t favorable.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I will be speaking at JAOO 2009, talking about advanced OR/M techniques and giving a tutorial about Rhino Mocks.  I spoke at JAOO 2007, and had a great time there. The content was superb and the attendees and the crew were great. I remember sitting at a session with Joe Armstrong talking about Erlang and finally getting things that were annoying just beyond my grasp, and that was one of several sessions that left me wanting more.  You can actually watch me and Hammett&#x2019;s session about Active Record in JAOO 2007.  This year, there are two things that I am looking forward to in JAOO.   Probably the most important one is that JAOO is giving free tickets for women, which hopefully help us avoid the token female per conference, which seems to be the rule.   There are women in IT, I know because I have met quite a few of them (the best coworker and the best project manager that I had the pleasure of working with where women). Hopefully this will get more of them into more visible spots.  The second, of course, is the content. For a change, I actually have the time to attend most of the sessions that I want to see. I&#x2019;ll probably change my mind at least a few more times, but here is my current list of session I plan to be at:     Working Effectively with Legacy Code 2 - Michael Feathers       I loved working effectively with legacy code, and I consider it the inspiration for Rhino Mocks. (I got to tell Michael Feathers that I &#x201C;blame&#x201D; him for Rhino Mocks in NDC 2009, priceless!)     Evolving the Key/Value programming model to a higher level - Billy Newport       I am quite interested in the no-sql databases, and this looks to be a good way to learn more about key / value pairs.     CouchDB from 3,333km - Jan Lehnardt       And, of course, I really like CouchDB. One of those days I am going to get a sponsor to finish Divan DB, too :-)     Enterprise Architecture, Top 10 Mistakes - Eoin Woods       Searched and Found - Fulltext search with Hibernate - Hardy Ferentschik       Those two run in parallel, but unfortunately I&#x2019;ll have to choose and pick. The first one sounds funny, the second one is interesting because I did a lot of work on the port of NHibernate Search, full text searching for NHibernate.     Buy it, Build it, Download It, or Browse It? Achieving Effectiveness with Enterprise Applications - Michael T. Nygard       No idea what this is about, but Michael Nygard (who I hope will never have to hear my trying to pronounce his last name) is someone I want to hear.     Object Relational Mapping &#x2B;= 2: More than just data &lt;-&gt; object - Oren Eini       Engineering in Five Dimensions - Michael T. Nygard       This is another problematic timing issue. I wonder if I can send Ayende to listen to Michael and have Oren give the presentation.     Distributed Programming the Google Way - Gregor Hohpe       And this ties back to my interest in distributed computing. Should be interesting    All in all, I hope to see you there.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One common request for NH Prof is that we will support multiple session factories. This turn out to be a bit more problematic than it would seems, mostly because NHibernate doesn&#x2019;t currently output this relation in any way that NH Prof can access.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I recently reviewed a code base. Nothing unusual about that, I do this all the time. But this is the first time that I actually had a migraine from reading a codebase.  I talked to a couple of team members about that, and the name of a previous developer came up repeatedly. That developer is no longer on the team, however, and has no input on the way it currently works. Moreover, the code base is pretty small, and the team had had sole ownership of that for months by this time.  Here is a small piece of advice, learned from my army experience, if you own something, you are also responsible for it. Now, there are some special cases, where it takes a while to turn the freighter, but after a while, that excuse is no longer valid.  It is your code, why is it so ugly that I have a migraine?!  And no, saying that X did that this way is not a valid option if it past a week from the time you got the code base. Take a look at the image to the right, what do you think is the first priority of a new captain on that ship?    And if it wasn&#x2019;t your priority, then it is going to be your fault that it is still in this stage. You don&#x2019;t get to blame the other guy. You own the code, you are responsible for it, period.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a short reply to Ward Bell&#x2019;s post, Do Not Make Every Method Virtual. More specifically, I have an issue with this statement:     My argument is with opening up the class blindly and totally by making everything virtual. Suddenly nothing in the class is truly &#x201C;closed for modification.&#x201D; The &#x201C;virtual&#x201D; keyword announces to the world &#x201C;here is my extension point.&#x201D; When every method is virtual, the world is invited to change every method.   I think that there is some confusion here. The original class is closed for modification. I can&#x2019;t change it. I can create a new class extending the behavior. That is what OCP is all about.  Ward is giving the example of an Elevator, and overriding its Up() method:     I knew that Up() sent the elevator ascending. But I can&#x2019;t stop someone from re-implementing Up() so that it descends instead. Maybe base.Up() triggers the doors to close. The developer might call base.Up() too late, sending the elevator in motion before the doors have closed. The developer could replace my base.Up with something that juggled the sequence of door closing and elevator motion methods, interleaving custom behaviors, yielding upward motion that failed to satisfy some other elevator guarantees.   And the problem here is&#x2026; ?  I am sorry, but I see some descriptions of potential bugs (or desired behaviors) listed here. I fail to see a problem.     But I write frameworks for you to use. You&#x2019;ve licensed my product and you&#x2019;re paying me for support. When the elevator goes down instead of up; when the doors close suddenly and injure a rider; when the elevator simply stops &#x2026; you don&#x2019;t say &#x201C;I wonder what I did?&#x201D; You say &#x201C;that elevator we bought is a piece of crap.&#x201D;   Well, guess what, if you switch the wires in the elevator, it will behave strangely. Nothing out of the ordinary here. And by switching the wires you accept responsibility for the actions you did.  I have several frameworks available that are nothing but huge extension points that the user can plug into at any point and at any time. More than that, I have those extension points at several layers, so they can choose at what level to interact. And no, those aren&#x2019;t designed extension points, they fall out of the way I build software. And so far, based on actual evidence on the field, it is working.</p>
