            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">[The title of this post is taken from a poem by Kipling&#xA0;The Old Issue.]     I&#x27;ve alluded in the past for a Big Day coming. It had come today!    Today, 28/07/2005 @ 11:03 AM I was released from the IDF after four years of service.&#xA;This was one hell of a good day, to say the least. I&#x27;m now officially a&#xA;mere citizen of Israel. The last four years have been... interesting.&#xA;I have served exclusively in military prisons, starting as a warder in&#xA;Prison 6, which is a prison for holding IDF soldiers. The work load was&#xA;crazy (19 hours a day was the norm) and the work wasn&#x27;t fun. I met a&#xA;lot of people that I wouldn&#x27;t have met otherwise, I got to help to some&#xA;of them, had two separate attempts by drug dealers (two different&#xA;ones)&#xA0; to have a contract (the fatal kind) on me. I got a lot of&#xA;people skill (mostly by necessity) and an aversion to Noblesse, which is the cigarette that the prisoners smoke.&#xA;Then I went for officers training and had the time of my life during&#xA;Bahad 1 (the training base for officers in the IDF). I had a lot of&#xA;really good people with me and I got to work on interesting problems&#xA;(mostly unrelated to what I would do, but it&#x27;s good to know that I can&#xA;conquer the mountain if I have to.).  Afterward it was a post&#xA;in&#xA0;the biggest prison in the Middle East. This time it was a&#xA;prison for Palestinians terrorists, the place is called Qteziot, but&#xA;most of the foreign media call it Ansar 3. I was quite shock to find&#xA;out just how many horror stories there are about the prison on the net&#xA;(most of it is wrong in so many levels I couldn&#x27;t formulate a rebuttal&#xA;even if I was allowed to).  The first thing I did when I got&#xA;to&#xA0;Qteziot was to get personally acquainted with each of the ~500&#xA;prisoners that I was in charge of, which is something that I truly&#xA;never want to do again. As a plain soldier I always thought that&#xA;officers had the easy life, since they didn&#x27;t deal with all the boring&#xA;/ ugly / annoying stuff, but for the first six months as an officer I&#xA;worked much harder then I ever worked as a soldier. I had a lot of fun,&#xA;and it was a good place to be in. The prison had just started to get&#xA;established and I was able to influence quite a bit there (in fact, I&#xA;designed the prison&#x27;s logo, which caused a redesign in the logos of all&#xA;the military prisons in Israel :-D ). I served there just under&#xA;two years, first as a Company Commander&#x27;s Second (probably bad&#xA;translation of the term), then as the prison&#x27;s Operations Officer. I&#xA;was also in charge of (the literal translation is Escorts Officer,&#xA;which sound just as bad in Hebrew as it is in English) of securely&#xA;transporting terrorists to courts, hospitals and other prisons. Near&#xA;the end I was the prison&#x27;s Instruction Officer, which allowed me to&#xA;create some spectacularly bad Power Point presentations and some really&#xA;cool movies ( in Windows Movie Maker, no less :-) ). At that point I&#xA;was getting sick of the prison, there were quite a few personal&#xA;changes, and I didn&#x27;t like the atmosphere in the place so I had a stint&#xA;in instruction soldiers fresh off Basic Training for about a month.&#xA;My new position was a prison&#x27;s commander near Jenin. It is a small&#xA;prison, which means that I was in charge of pretty much everything. The&#xA;good side was that I was free to do mostly as I pleased, but the flip&#xA;side was that I also had to handle a lot of the routine stuff myself.&#xA;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good or bad that I couldn&#x27;t blog about that time.&#xA;Although what I&#x27;d to say would be of interest to very&#xA;few.&#xA0;Nevertheless,&#xA0;it would have felt better to tell someone&#xA;all those strange stories. Take for example the mess that crazy inmate&#xA;in cell #3 did when he set fire to the cell because he wanted a bottle&#xA;of coke (the drink, not the drug), or what happened when the transport&#xA;to the asylum got to a completely different prison. Oh the&#xA;other hand, maybe it&#x27;s better that I didn&#x27;t post those things, they are&#xA;mostly insider&#x27;s jokes. And I don&#x27;t suppose that anyone who read this&#xA;blog has spend any time working at a prison.     During the time I was in the army I had to deal with the strangest situations. What do you do when a soldier hands you a live scorpion as a parting gift, for instance? That is not something that Miss Manners ever covered, I bet. :-)&#xA;Four years have passed, I&#x27;m now a part of the reserve army of the IDF&#xA;(and likely would continue serving in prisons when on reserve duty :-(&#xA;), looking back, it was interesting at times, often frustrating and&#xA;hard, almost always the situation was when I had to a choice between&#xA;what I was supposed to do and what I wanted to do. I got to discuss&#xA;politics with&#xA0;a panel that included the&#xA0;Islamic Jihad, the&#xA;Hamas and the&#xA0;PLO (the three main terrorists organizations) with&#xA;side comments from the Democratic Front and the Communist Front (the&#xA;two minor terrorists organization, which are even more fanatics than&#xA;the rest, if this is possible). That was a good way to pass the night&#xA;shits; we usually managed to resolve all the problems in a reasonable&#xA;manner and reach world peace by 4:10 AM, by which time we had to stop&#xA;so they could pray.  I was part of the Derech Chadasha (New&#xA;Path) operation, during the Hudna&#x27;s days (when it seemed that there&#xA;might be peace in the Middle East), as Israel released close to three&#xA;hundred prisoners, all of them have signed a declaration saying that&#xA;they will not deal with Terror again. Just over a month later, two bombings, in Tzriffin and Jerusalem&#xA0;both&#xA;of them were released in Derech Chadasha. It was this, among many other&#xA;things, that made serving there so hard. On the one hand you are&#xA;required to provide the prisoners with proper treatment and on the&#xA;other hand... you listen to the news and see a bombing in Jerusalem and&#xA;hear them celebrating. And that is in addition to the usual conflict of&#xA;being in a position where you need to take care of people who would truly like to kill you.&#xA0;    I&#x27;m glad beyond words that I&#x27;ve finished with all of this.&#xA;I look back, and four years have passed. I&#x27;m not the same man I was&#xA;when I entered the army. I grew, I learned (mostly thing I didn&#x27;t want&#xA;to know), I experienced both joy and sadness, had successes and&#xA;failures. I wouldn&#x27;t repeat it for anything, yet I wouldn&#x27;t give up the&#xA;experience for the world. How did a geek like me ended up being in such&#xA;a place, I truly cannot say.    I remember that on the first few days of my last post I was in an interview with my commander and he mentioned that no one&#xA;have ever finished such a post without at least a single&#xA0;criminal&#xA;investigation. Talk about encouragement.&#xA0;I was the first to manage&#xA;to do that. Thinking about it, I never once was on trial (and in this&#xA;army, this means a lot, they put you to trail for losing a magazine). &#xA;I&#x27;m free to do as I please now, the Army&#x27;s Phone (which they call VPN,&#xA;for some reason) is no longer. I will not get calls in the middle of&#xA;the night, or Friday&#x27;s Shabbat Supper about whatever strange thing this&#xA;or that prisoner did which require my personal attention. I will wake&#xA;up in Sunday and I&#x27;ll not have to go back to prison.&#xA0;I can now&#xA;leave by no man&#x27;s leave, underneath the law. Time to start a new life.&#xA;Most soldiers go to a trip abroad when they are released from the army,&#xA;usually to the Far East, it&#x27;s called &quot;To Sit Under A Mushroom&quot; and&#xA;include high levels of alcohol and drugs and low level of personal&#xA;hygiene. There is a nice song about such a boy, called: &quot;Moshe, You&#x27;re&#xA;Not A Hedgehog.&quot; I&#x27;ve considered it carefully and decided that I&#x27;ve&#xA;objections on several levels to that, so I&#x27;ll pass.    Now I need to get a job and start living the life where you get up in the morning and you got a choice at what you wear.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince    I finished reading it today, and I was... not quite disappointed, but it didn&#x27;t hook me quite as much as the other books. It may be that the part of my brain that deals with books merely shut itself down from overload. It is a good book, and it continue to move both the plot and the maturity of the characters onwards. It&#x27;s a more mature book then the others, but somehow the ending didn&#x27;t affect me as much as the ending of the 5th book.</p>
