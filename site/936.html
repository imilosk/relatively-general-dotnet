            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I work with several clients that has a Mainframe computer which is (of course) the center of their business. Looking at the desk of the mainframe guys, I see books such as &quot;Useful User Subroutines for the Administrator&quot; and such. The terminology that is used when discussing mainframes is quite different than the one that is used to discuss mini computers. Things like global flags to modify system state and beaming files (sorry, I only know the Hebrew term for this).    I am afraid that my understanding on mainframes is just that they are much better in reliability and I/O than mini computers. I&#x27;m interested to learn enough so I can understand the concepts that they are talking about. I Googled about it, of course, but I can&#x27;t find the information that I want. What I would like to understand is the core concepts that are used. For instance, if I would have been ask to describe Unix, I would explain how everything is a file (except folders :-) ), etc.    Any good resources about it?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;ve been reading the LLBLGen documentation for the last couple of days, and it&#x2019;s an interesting read. I think that I should say first that I have a very strong bias toward NHibernate, so please don&#x2019;t think that I&#x2019;m an impartial observer here.     Before I really dove into NHibernate, I read Hibernate in Action (still the best book for learning Hibernate, in my opinion). I&#x2019;m trying to give LLBLGen (who came up with this name? It is worse than Microsoft&#x2019;s naming) the same treatment, and read the entire manual before I dive into the code. This way I will have a fair understanding of the system as I play with it. I don&#x2019;t think that O/RM are something you can just start cowboy coding, not if you want to understand what is going on, at least.     So far, one thing is very clear: LLBLGen is not Hibernate. Not even close. The design decisions that have been made are completely different than the ones that were made for Hibernate. (That is not to say that they are wrong, just that they are different than what I am used to). I found myself wonder &#x201C;Why did they do that for?&#x201D; fairly often, but the documentation is very good, so I usually find the reasons sooner or later. I do wonder how much of the difference is because of the different scenarios that affected development.     In .Net, rich client applications are common, in Java, very rare. This means that Hibernate is heavily biased toward web development approach, with short lived sessions and request type of actions. (Do this, fetch that, etc), in those scenarios the entities that you are working with are going away when the request is over. LLBLGen seems to be designed with rich clients in mind, where the entities can last for a long time. This change is one of the major differences between the two, and it affects quite a bit of the way both frameworks are structured.     Some things that I noticed so far were:                         What the documentation calls SelfServing entities looks a lot like ActiveRecord object (the pattern, not the library).                             There seems to be a high level of interaction with the database in the code level. (There seems to be a lot going on with explicit IDs, field indexes, etc. It is wrapped in enums, but it is there). I&#x27;m not sure how much of it is in my face when I&#x27;m coding, though.                             I really don&#x2019;t like the way you fetch entities from the database. You need to create a new instance of the object and pass the PK to the constructor. It looks like doing stuff in reverse to mean. Worse, this means that you need to know the type of the object that you are loading at compile time. I&#x2019;m not sure that there are ways around it, since the documentation states that this is a by design choice.                             One thing that I really liked is&#xA0;that it&#xA0;is possible to do updates on more than one entity easily. What I mean is that I can make LLBLGen issue this statement &#x201C;UPDATE Customers SET Valued = 0 WHERE LastPurchase &lt; getdate() &#x2013; 365&#x201D;. I am not aware of a way to do the same in NHibernate (and in this case I would probably just call a stored procedure), but it is very good to be able to do this.                             LLBLGen Predicates are comparable to NHibernate&#x2019;s Expressions, which are extremely useful. I don&#x2019;t see something similar to HQL; I don&#x2019;t like AST that much.                             There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be a way to handle cascades properly. This means that I would have to do it manually, and I&#x2019;m not enthusiastic about managing this myself. This is one of the places where it is easy to get it wrong in NHibernate, so I can see why this decision was made. It is probably possible to handle this within the database itself, but I&#x27;m not sure all the databases supports it.              Just to be clear, I wrote this post without doing anything real with LLBLGen except reading the documentation and reading the code in the sample application and after investing a lot of time and effort into NHibernate, there is no way I can be impartial. NHibernate is a complete abstraction over a database, which means that in 99% of the cases, you don&#x27;t feel like you are working against a database. LLBLGen is not a complete abstraction, the database is most definately there if you need to use it. From reading the sample application source, I think that you can certainly avoid the database if you don&#x27;t want to. It means that LLBLGen allows to take advantage of some features of the database that are not possible / easy to do so in NHibernate, like updating sets of rows in one query.     NHibernate seems more capable in the area of taking a convulted of schemas and presenting an OO view of it that you desire. I&#x27;ll freely admit that my scenarios are not usual, and that I tend to take advantage of features that I probably shouldn&#x27;t.     There isn&#x27;t a conclustion to this post, because I don&#x27;t have one. In general, I would like to use NHibernate, since I&#x27;m very familiar with it and what I can do with it. LLBLGen has several features that I wish that I could have in NHibernate (but I don&#x27;t see them coming, since they require different design and approach).

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There always seems to be a great debate with regard to what data type will be used as the primary key for tables. The debate is mostly centered on whatever we should use identity fields vs Guids.    Guids has the advantage that they are globally unique (duh!), so they are a good solution for the cases where you need to merge data from several sources. Identity fields are easier to understand (Quick, what is the difference between 8833075D-8861-4324-8814-421BD5F04C7D and&#xA0;AD7FF558-DFCB-4354-9D68-C1DD926BC22A) and to debug since you can easily see the difference between concecutive rows. They can cause problems in merge scenarios, since it is entirely all too possible that the identity columns from different machines will be identical.    Another, bigger, problem with Guids is that they are random by nature, which mean that using them as a clustered primary key has distinct disadvantages in high insert rate scenarios. The problem is that two concecutive rows will be put in two different pages, assuming an even distribution of the Guids, in high insert scenarios the I/O generated by using it can become the most significant cost of the whole operation. SQL Server will constantly load pages to memory and discard them when it run out of room in the cache.    In SQL Server 2005 there is a better solution for this, although I have not heard anyone talks about it. Instead of using Guids, you can use Sequencial Guids. What does this mean? SQL Server 2005 has a new functions that you can use for creating Guids, called newsequentialid(). This function can generate sequencial (per machine) guids. You get vastly improved performance for high insert rate scenarios, since all your inserts are likely to go into a small set of pages amd you can safely merge between multiply machines, since the sequencial Guids are still globally unique.    Here are a couple that I generated: 13D3AFD4-CDCA-DA11-9389-000C6EFB7322 and 14D3AFD4-CDCA-DA11-9389-000C6EFB7322    One thing to note, though: Don&#x27;t use Sequencial Guids as a session id, since then an attacker knows what will be the next id generated (obviously) and try to use it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This&#xA0;is much better than Oracle, in my opinion. Still, it means that NHibernate (and Hibernate) are now under the Red Hat&#x27;s umbrella.    I wonder if it will make it an easier or harder sell when I try to convince people that &quot;Yes, Open Source Software doesn&#x27;t mean that you are all along with hungy wolves all around you.&quot;</p>

You can read about the community here.    I am going to post mainly Hebrew stuff there (since it kind of hard to explain why Reshumot is a bad name for the accounting package in English) and because I would like to learn to write in Hebrew again :-) This is still my main blog, I&#x27;ll just be posting stuff there that just isn&#x27;t meaningful to readers outside of Israel. I&#x27;m guessing that there will be a fair bit of overlap between the two, as well.    The community there is at the very start, of course, but be sure to subscribe now, there is going ot be a lot of content there soon.</p>

I don&#x27;t think it will be a top 10 hit, though. &#xA;There are several crucial differences between the &quot;DO_CR_DA&quot; and &quot;DO_DA_CR&quot;, although both are called from the same place and looks nearly the same. &#xA;It doesn&#x27;t matter how long it takes the code to run, you can keep yourself busy for days, trying to gues what the method names mean.</p>

For this post, I&#x27;m not going to bring up searching by business rules,&#xA;since that is a different can of worms.&#xA;&#xA;To&#xA;simplify the above UI, I think we can say that we need to search by any or all&#xA;of the following:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA; Name&#xA; Content&#xA; Modification&#xA;     before&#xA; Modification&#xA;     after&#xA; Maximum&#xA;     size&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;Here&#xA;is my first implementation of the procedure:&#xA;&#xA;CREATE&#xA;PROCEDURE&#xA;SearchFileListing&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; @name as nvarchar(255),&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; @content as nvarchar(max),&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; @modifiedAfter as datetime,&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; @modifiedBefore as datetime,&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; @maximumSize as int&#xA;&#xA;AS&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; SELECT name,&#xA;content, modifiedDate, size&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; FROM FileListing files&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; WHERE&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; &#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; files.name =&#xA;isnull(@name,files.name)&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; AND files.content&#xA;like &#x27;%&#x27; &#x2B;&#xA;isnull(@content, files.content) &#x2B; &#x27;%&#x27;&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; AND files.modifiedDate &gt;= isnull(@modifiedAfter, files.modifiedDate)&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; AND files.modifiedDate &lt;= isnull(@modifiedBefore, files.modifiedDate)&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; AND&#xA;files.size &gt;=&#xA;isnull(@maximumSize, files.size)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;While&#xA;I have not tested it, I&#x27;m pretty sure that the performance of this stored&#xA;procedure is not ideal. For one thing, it will always search all the columns, which&#xA;mean that if there is an index available for the query (for instance, if we are&#xA;searching by filename only), it wouldn&#x27;t be used. This is the easiest SP to&#xA;write (although apparently not very obvious). &#xA;&#xA;To&#xA;be clear, the above procedure always does a table scan (or a clustered index&#xA;scan, if it has a clustered index), even if there are indexes that can be used&#xA;to help this particular query. For instance, if we have an index on the size&#xA;column, it will not be used with the above procedure.&#xA;&#xA;We&#xA;can re-write this procedure with IF statements to execute a different stored&#xA;procedure per each possibility, but the number of possibilities Is too large to&#xA;write a stored procedure for every possibility (which is the recommended approach).&#xA;And this is for a relatively case. In most cases, using the SP approach, I&#xA;would either suffer the performance degradation with a procedure like the one above,&#xA;create a few common search paths (for instance, not including the Content&#xA;column) or turn to sp ExecuteSql procedure (and the problems it entails).&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;In&#xA;comparison, check out the code to handle searching using NHibernate:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;ICriteria&#xA;query = session.CreateCriteria(typeof(File));&#xA;&#xA;if&#xA;(nameTxtBx.Text != &quot;&quot;)&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; query.Add(Expression.Eq(&quot;File&quot;,&#xA;nameTxtBx.Text ));&#xA;&#xA;if&#xA;(contentTxtBx.Text != &quot;&quot;)&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; query.Add(Expression.Like(&quot;Content&quot;, &quot;%&quot;&#x2B;contentTxtBox.Text&#x2B;&quot;%&quot;));&#xA;&#xA;if&#xA;(modifiedSelect.HasSelection)&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; query.Add(Expression.Between(&quot;Modified&quot;,&#xA;modifiedSelect.From, modifiedSelect.To));&#xA;&#xA;if&#xA;(sizeSelect.HasSelection)&#xA;&#xA;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0;&#x5B2;&#xA0; query.Add(Expression.Le(&quot;Size&quot;,&#xA;sizeSelect.Value));&#xA;&#xA;return query.List();&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;As&#xA;a note, this is not only easier to read, it will also produce queries&#xA;that will perform much better than the SP approach, because they will search&#xA;for exactly the right stuff, and allow SQL Server to use the indexes on the&#xA;table without going to the trouble of writing every possibility (which has its&#xA;own set of problem).</p>
