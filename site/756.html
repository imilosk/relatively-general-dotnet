            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am currently working on making this syntax possible, and letting ideas buzz at the back of my head regarding the implementation of the ETL engine itself. This probably requires some explanation. My idea about this is to separate the framework into two distinct layers. The core engine, which I&#x27;ll talk about in a second, and the DSL syntax. One of the basic design decisions was that the DSL would be declarative, and not imperative. How does this follow, when I have something like this working: source ComplexGenerator:&#xA;&#x9;CommandGenerator:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;if Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;production&quot;):&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;SELECT * FROM Production.Customers&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;else:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;return &quot;SELECT * FROM Test.Customers&quot;&#xA;This certainly looks like an imperative language to me... (And no, this isn&#x27;t really an example of something that I would recommend doing, it is here just make the principal).&#xA;The idea is that the DSL is used to build the object graph, then we can execute that object graph. But building it in a two stage fashion make it a lot easier to deal with such things as validation, visualization, etc.&#xA;Now, let us more to the core engine, and see what I have been thinking about. Core concepts:&#xA;&#xA;Connection - The details about how to get the IDbConnection instance, including such things as number of concurrent connection, etc... &#xA;DataSource - Contains the details about how to get the data. Command to execute, parameters, associated connection, etc. &#xA;DataDestination - Contains the details about how to write the data, command / action to execute, parameters, connection, etc. &#xA;Row - A single row. A simple key &lt;-&gt; value structure with a twist that it can also contain other rows (from a merge/join) &#xA;Transform - Transform the current row &#xA;RowSet - a set of rows, obviously, useful for aggregation, lookup, etc. Not really sure how it should come into play yet.&#xA;The architecture of the whole thing is based on the pipeline idea, obviously. Now, there are several implementation decisions that should be considered from there.&#xA;&#xA;Destination as the driver. The destination is the driver behind this architecture, it request the next row from the pipeline, which starts things rolling. Implementation can be as simple as:foreach(Row row in Pipeline.NextRow())&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;PushToDestination(row);&#xA;} This has the side affect of making the entire pipeline single threaded per destination, it makes it much easier to implement, and would make it easier to see the flow of things. Parallelism can be managed by multiple pipelines and/or helper threads. The major benefit in parallelism is with the data read/write, and those are limited to a pipeline at any rate.It does bring up the interesting question of how to deal with something like merge join, which requires multiply inputs, you would need to manage the different inputs in the merge, but I think that this is mandatory anyway.&#xA;&#xA;Message passing architecture. In this architecture, each component (source, transform, destination) is basically an independent object with input/output channels, they all operate without reliance on each other. This is more complex because you can&#x27;t do the simplest thing of just giving each component a thread, so you need to manage yielding and concurrency to a much higher degree.A bigger issue is that it puts a higher burden on writing components.&#xA;Right now I am leaning toward going to the single threaded pipeline idea, any comments?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here is the first test: [Test] &#xA;public void EvaluatingScript_WithConnection_WillAddDataSourceToContext() &#xA;{ &#xA;&#x9;EtlConfigurationContext configurationContext = EtlContextBuilder.FromFile(@&quot;Connections\connection_only.retl&quot;);&#xA;&#x9;Assert.AreEqual(3, configurationContext.Connections.Count, &quot;should have three connections&quot;);&#xA;}&#xA;There is quite a bit of information just in this test, we introduced the EtlConfigurationContext class, decided that we will create it from a factory, and that we have something that is called a connection. Another decision made was the &#x201C;retl&#x201D; extension (Rhino ETL), but that is a side benefit.&#xA;The source for this is:&#xA;Connection( &#xA;&#x9;&quot;Northwind&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;ConnectionType: SqlConnection,&#xA;&#x9;ConnectionString: &quot;Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=Northwind; Integrated Security=SSPI;&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;ConcurrentConnections: 5&#xA;&#x9;)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;Connection( &#xA;&#x9;&quot;SouthSand&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;ConnectionType: OracleConnection,&#xA;&#x9;ConnectionStringName: &quot;SouthSand&quot;&#xA;&#x9;)&#xA;&#xA;Connection( &#xA;&#x9;&quot;StrangeOne&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;ConnectionType: OracleConnection,&#xA;&#x9;ConnectionStringGenerator: { System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;MyEnvVar&quot;) }&#xA;&#x9;)&#xA;You may have wondered about the last one, what does this do? Well, it allows you to do runtime evaluation of something, in this case, it get the value from an env-var, but that has a lot of potential. Here it a test that demonstrate the capabilities:&#xA;[Test]&#xA;public void DataSources_ConnectionStringGenerator_CanUseEvnrionmentVariables()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;MyEnvVar&quot;,&quot;MyExpectedValue&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Assert.AreEqual(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&quot;MyExpectedValue&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;configurationContext.Connections[&quot;StrangeOne&quot;].ConnectionString&#xA;&#x9;);&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;MyEnvVar&quot;, &quot;2&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Assert.AreEqual(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&quot;2&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;configurationContext.Connections[&quot;StrangeOne&quot;].ConnectionString&#xA;&#x9;);&#xA;&#xA;}</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I finalized thinking about Rhino.ETL late last night, and then went to bed. I couldn&#x27;t sleep for over an hour later, kept rolling thinks in my head. When I caught myself thinking about how I would design the test strategy when I was in the shower, I knew that it is an emergency, this idea wants to get out, badly. Help! I am attached by my own muse!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note: This is just syntax idea that I have in my head right now, it has no implementation.  I have decided to do something about, and spent some time thinking about it, here is the initial design. It is a textual DSL for ETL. What you can see directly below is in a direct correlation of a lot of the stuff that I need to do with SSIS.&#xA0; The first one is basically a Data Flow task. The script goes like this:  Define two data sources, and you can see that I ma using named connection strings in one, and hard coded connection string in the other. Define the source, which is a SQL command, against Oracle database, with supports for parameters (that is not something that SSIS can do, amazing as it sounds). Note that the parameters are retrieved by executing SQL against the different databases, and then storing it in a variable. We have a simple transform, which include some logic as well as string manipulation and date formatting, all things that are disgustingly hard in SSIS. Then we have the destination, we define the command that we want to execute, and we get all the parameters from the context (note that we are using a new parameter that we created in the transform &quot;@Registered&quot;. We are also defining a BatchSize, which should increase performance if it matters.  DataSource(&#xA;&#x9;&quot;SouthSand&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;&quot;System.Data.SqlConnection&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;&quot;Data Source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=SouthSand&quot;&#xA;&#x9;)&#xA;&#xA;DataSource(&#xA;&#x9;&quot;Northwind&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;&quot;Orale.Client.OracleConnection&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[&quot;Northwind&quot;]&#xA;&#x9;)&#xA;&#xA;source Northwind:&#xA;&#x9;Sql: &quot;&quot;&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;SELECT CustomerID,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   CompanyName,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   ContactName,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   ContactTitle,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   Address,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   City,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   Region,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   PostalCode,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   Country,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   Phone,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;   Fax,                   RegisteredYear,                   RegisteredMonth,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9; FROM tblCustomers&#xA;&#x9;&#x9; WHERE LastUpdateDate BETWEEN :lastUpdate AND :currentTime&#xA;&#x9;      &quot;&quot;&quot;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Parameters:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;@lastUpdate = ExecuteScalar(&quot;SouthSand&quot;, &quot;GetLastRunTimeForETL&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;@currentTime = ExecuteScalar(&quot;Northwind&quot;, &quot;SELECT sysdate from dual&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;transform:&#xA;&#x9;@Phone = @Fax if @Phone is null&#xA;&#x9;@CustomerId = @CustomerId.ToLower()        @Registered = date(@RegisteredYear,@RegisteredMonth, 1)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;destination SouthSand:&#xA;&#x9;BatchSize: 500&#xA;&#x9;Command: &quot;&quot;&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;INSERT INTO  [Customers]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;(&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;[CustomerID] ,[CompanyName],[ContactName],[ContactTitle],&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;[Address],[City],[Region],[PostalCode],[Country],[Phone],&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;[Fax],[Registered]&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;VALUES&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;@CustomerID,@CompanyName,@ContactName,@ContactTitle,@Address,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;@City,@Region,@PostalCode,@Country,@Phone,@Fax,@Registered&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&quot;&quot;&quot;&#xA;If this is a data flow, how would the overall package look like? Let us take a package like this one, which is a format that I am using right now to do a lot of things.&#xA;DataSource(&#xA;&#x9;&quot;SouthSand&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;&quot;System.Data.SqlConnection&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;&quot;Data Source=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=SouthSand&quot;&#xA;&#x9;)&#xA;&#xA;DataSource(&#xA;&#x9;&quot;Northwind&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;&quot;Orale.Client.OracleConnection&quot;,&#xA;&#x9;System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[&quot;Northwind&quot;]&#xA;&#x9;)&#xA;&#xA;Execute(&quot;SouthSand&quot;, &quot;etl.TruncateAllTables&quot;) # etl.TruncateAllTables is a stored proc&#xA;&#xA;sequence: &#xA;&#x9;DataFlow(&quot;Customers.flow&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;DataFlow(&quot;Orders.flow&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;DataFlow(&quot;Products.flow&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;DataFlow(&quot;ProductStatuses.flow&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;DataFlow(&quot;OrderStatuses.flow&quot;)&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;Execute(&quot;SouthSand&quot;, &quot;etl.CleanData&quot;) &#xA;Execute(&quot;SouthSand&quot;, &quot;etl.UpdateInsertAllTables&quot;) &#xA;This probably means that I will have a way of inheriting the Data Source definitions. It took me about an hour to think it though, but I have this running through my head for a while now.&#xA;I estimate that it should take me a day or two to build this DSL. But you know what, once I have that, writing the ETL processes themselves are down to minutes! What is much more important is that I would estimate a similar amount of time to get an SSIS package of the same complexity ready to go, under the same circumstances, and I refuse to make estimates regarding SSIS deployments.&#xA;So, about the same time to build a new framework as it would take me to build a single task. Yes, it will not have a designer, but it will be maintainable RAD!&#xA;Nitpicker corner: No, it will not do XYZ feature of SSIS (lookups come to mind, or SSIS joins), but I rarely use them, and they are fairly simple to write once I do need them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jdn doesn&#x27;t agree with me:  .NET OSS developers *can&#x27;t* have it both ways. &#xA0;They can&#x27;t complain about Microsoft &#x27;reinventing the wheel&#x27; and not make it about a competition. &#xA0;It is the same thing, when it boils down to it.What is the complaint otherwise? &#xA0;That Microsoft shouldn&#x27;t come out with something that mirrors OSS efforts unless it is 10 times better? &#xA0;10 times better according to whom? &#xA0;You? &#xA0;The OSS police?  [...snip...] Your own and Jeremy Miller&#x27;s own blogs about &#x27;building a better CAB in an hour&#x27; *reek* of &#x27;it is a competition.&#x27;I do not doubt that you do not intend it to come across that way, but it certainly does, in spades, and I don&#x27;t see how you could think otherwise. Let me start by saying that I believe that it is a poor mind that can&#x27;t argue against itself (and win). I most certainly can have it both ways. I can complain about MS reinventing the wheel when they aren&#x27;t providing as much value as existing stuff, because they are in a position where people will follow them blindly. This means that they have the responsibility to be just as good as the existing things out there. I think that you missed an important distinction here, it is not about OSS, or using something other than MS, it is about not having to deal with a half-assed product. I would rather have nothing from Microsoft than something that doesn&#x27;t do everything that I expect something in its category to do. The reasoning is very simple, if I have nothing from Microsoft, it is much easier to build / buy something else. If there is something from Microsoft, but it is not up to par with the established standards, that is bad. It is bad because &quot;you don&#x27;t get fired for buying Microsoft&quot; way of thinking. And yes, this is a big issue to me. I would much rather do actual work than have to argue politics about &quot;But we are a Microsoft shop and they have a really cool presentation&quot;. Pointing out things that I don&#x27;t like, or consider overblown is not something that I would consider a competition, I do much the same for a lot of other things, including my own.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Take a look at this (highly simplified) package. The flow is very simple, truncate shadow tables, copy to shadow tables, perform cleanup and copy to the real tables. The inside of each data flow is simple Source -&gt; Convert to Unicode -&gt; Destination. Not really complicated or ground breaking, right? The shadow tables have the same structure as the real tables, but they have no FKs.  It failed on me, in production, but only when running as a job! The error? Primary Key violation in the Products Statuses and Order Statuses tables. I have verified that:  I am truncating those tables That only one instance of the job is running at any single time That the source data is neither changing nor invalid (those are lookup tables with 6 and 2 values, respectively) 99% reproducible, it would give an error when running as a job, 50% reproducible, it would give the error when running from dtexec.  After hitting the wall with it for way too long, I &quot;fixed&quot; it by doing:   Why it would make a difference, I have no idea.  The original version is what I was using for the last four or five months, and it never gave me any problems, until three days ago, just when I wanted to load it to production. I have began thinking about how to build my own &quot;ETL engine&quot; for the next project, code is reliable, safe, debuggable and easy to understand. Something in Boo is probably the way to go... I had enough of fighting with tools!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Hammett calls the term &quot;Fluent Interface&quot; unnecessary:  And about Fluent interfaces, what about OOP? What about method chaining? Does it need, for god&#x2019;s sake, a new name? This is method chaining: string user = new StringBuilder()&#xA;&#x9;.Append(&quot;Name: &quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.Append(user.Name)&#xA;&#x9;.AppendLine()&#xA;&#x9;.Append(&quot;Email: &quot;)&#xA;&#x9;.Append(user.Email)&#xA;&#x9;.AppendLine()&#xA;&#x9;.ToString();&#x9;&#xA;And this is a fluent interface:&#xA;return new Finder&lt;Order&gt;(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Order.User == CurrentUser &amp;&amp;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Order.TotalCost &gt; Money.Dollars(150) ||&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Order.OrderLines.Count &gt; 15&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;),&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;OrderBy.Order.CreatedAt&#xA;&#x9;).List();&#xA;Anders posts about DSL building&#xA0;contains examples that are tied more closely to the domain.&#xA;Method chaining is something that you would certainly use in the a fluent interface, but that is like saying that you need to use interfaces when you build a plugin framework. The fact that you are using something doesn&#x27;t mean that what you do is only that something.&#xA;Fluent interfaces are different than merely method chaining because they allow you to express your intent in the domain terms and&#xA0;allows you to get more readable code. Method chaining, operator overloading, nasty generics tricks are all part of that, certainly, but the end result is much more than just a simple method chain.&#xA;And yes, I think that it certainly deserves its own name.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This comment&#xA0;on Anders&#x27; blog&#xA0;has been brought to my attention:  I really enjoyed what Anders and Ayende did when they took the piss with Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;cool&quot; new technologies when they wrote Mean Fiddler and Bumbler in record time. Its a pity that these master programmers don&#x27;t want to continue developing these frameworks - it would be soooo cool to see open source alternatives to M$ stuff taking the lead before M$ are able to release anything themselves. Anders&#x27; post is about new development with&#xA0;Fiddler,&#xA0;exposing NHibernate&#x27;s entities over REST&#xA0;services (which deserves another post all together). I wanted to respond to this comment because of several things:  M$ - I would imagine that it is at least somewhat offensive to Microsoft when this is&#xA0;used. &quot;taking a piss&quot; - No, I use a bathroom for that. The general tone of the comment is basically amount us vs. them, which is completely opposite to the way I see things. I didn&#x27;t wrote&#xA0;Bumbler to show off anything, I wrote it because I was annoyed that Jasper was presented as&#xA0;some great &amp; heroic thing, when in practice it is very simple wrapper around existing functionality. I imagine that Anders has much the same reasoning when writing Fiddler, the counterpart to Astoria. The initial versions, at least, exists to make a point, not to show who is better. Writing software based on the old &quot;I&#x27;ll show them&quot; is not a good idea, in my opinion.  I am working on OSS because:  It it interesting It makes my job easier Clear my head I get plenty of benefits (from code reviews to patches, from bug reports to experience) Taking both those platforms and extending them to be usable (which is what is happening to Mean Fiddler right now) is dependant on need, not development for the sake of competition. As an aside, I would generally rather use something that already exists than write my own, on the condition that I get the same simplicity, flexibility and quality that I would get if I would write it on my own. A lot of the stuff from Microsoft fit that bill (most of the .Net framework), and a lot of the stuff doesn&#x27;t (the entire Web Forms stack, to start with). That is the main motivation, to make my work easier.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I dislike SSIS intently, and I say this as someone who has done two projects using it, and has spent much time recently struggling to work with it .Instead of harping how much I dislike, I decided that it would be better to list the things that I find it so hateful:  Bad Errors: The number one reason that I am using .Net instead of C&#x2B;&#x2B; is not the garbage collection, it is the errors. Clear, understandable errors, with the ability to trace them back into their source. Errors that gives you the reason for what happened. SSIS&#x27; errors are anything but useful. Often you will get some sort of a cryptic COM error, and maybe you will get lucky and get the message from the database, instead of relying on SSIS&#x27;s errors.The errors are not only hard to figure out, they are often hard to find, hiding in a mess of all the other information (mostly useless) that SSIS throws at you. No attempt is made to make it easier to locate and find the errors, those are left as an exercise for the user.The last time I felt this alone I was working with Pascal, trying to understand how the code moved the spindle of the HD using ASM commands.  Random Errors: I like predictability. One of the worse things that can happen to you is that you get an &quot;sometimes it happens, but I don&#x27;t know why&quot; error report. With SSIS, I literally had the entire project breaking up because I made such a significant change as changing the connection string. They are few things that I like less than having to deal with stuff that make me work in a stupid way, SSIS&#x27; way is to force me to go through all&#xA0;the boxes in my package and approved that I want it to do the same thing that it did before.  Keeping track of what it shouldn&#x27;t: I wish I had a dollar for every time that SSIS kept track of something it shouldn&#x27;t. Be it the old configuration, hard coding the connection string inside the package and completely ignoring the configuration... etc.  Sorry excuse for deployment: As you can probably see from above, SSIS&#x27;s previous faults doesn&#x27;t make for a nice transfer to production. I had to deal with that today, and it was a pain. Things just refuse to work if you move them between machines, when the database target remains the same. In most cases, those are &quot;need new metadata&quot; or plain &quot;I am broke&quot; errors, which leave you with the tried and true method of getting VS, opening the package, and starting to mess around with that manually, until it decides that it doesn&#x27;t hate you so much again. Requiring VS to deploy successfully is a big mistake, but I have been unable to avoid this requirement in any package of any complexity so far.Would I need to do it again when I want to redeploy? Why, yes! It is not like I have better things to do...!  Security? Who needs that: I should also mention that SSIS packages requires sysadmin rights to run when scheduled as a job. Which of course it will not tell you until you have run the job. I am aware of the agent proxy solution, it still remains a mystery to me why this is a requirement, after all, you can run an SSIS package just fine from inside SQL Server, just not as a job.  UI formatting instructions along side with the executable code: Here is another huge mistake. The SSIS package contains both the executable blocks and the formatting for it, making it completely unreadable from plain text perspective, and making it impossible to understand what has change from a diff of the file.  No thought about version control: As long as we touch that, SSIS packages and configuration might as well be binary objects, they are completely opaque for version control, and the decision to make the configuration files for SSIS un-indented was made by someone who really never had to modify a configuration file outside of the pretty UI, or wanted to actually see what is going to change.  Bad configuration scheme: This bring me to the configuration scheme itself, yes, you can put the configuration anywhere you want, from incomprehensible XML files with hard coded paths to SQL tables to which you will have to have an hard coded connection string, from environment variables (WTF?!) to stored inside the package.  Random configuration scheme: The problem with all those options is that SSIS seems to choose between those at random. At times it would choose the connection that it had assimilated inside the package, at times it would go to the wrong file, get the old configuration, or just complains that it is not having fun and that I should baby sit it again.  Bad UI: If we are talking about baby sitting, that is what the UI makes me feels like. Having to feed it very carefully, in smaaaalll bites, what I would like it to do. Going through six&#xA0;dialogs and three property grid just to&#xA0;get something to work is not my idea of fun, and SSIS has the lovely errors to point your way.&#xA0;Oh, and there is the advanced property dialog, if I was feeling stupid.Then there are the worse issue, building expressions is horribly broken from the UI perspective, you can see the evaluated string if it is bigger than a few lines, and no one will help you if you dare break the source string into multiply lines.  Lack of extensibility: My company has actually developed a series of components for SSIS, they cost a lot of time and frustration, so I can honestly say that trying to extend SSIS is nothing but pain.  Bad interoperability: As it happened, I am dealing with Oracle. As an integration services platform, I fully expected SSIS to support this little known database, but it doesn&#x27;t. I will spare you the pain of &quot;CREATE VIEW Customers_SSIS_DOESNT_LIKE_ORA_TABLES as SELECT * FROM Customers;&quot;, but I assume your can guess the rest.  Busy work: I mentioned it before, but SSIS is very click happy, requiring your to do a lot of work with the mouse, over and over again. Just trying adding a field to a data source, see how much pain you have to go through as you have to go through each and every one of the steps that it passed along the way, even if they never touched that field. Heaven forbid that you dare to remove a field. Did I mentioned the lovely huge dialog when SSIS basically tells you: &quot;Nothing have changes, shall I map with the same column names?&quot;  Hard to debug:&#xA0;Today I had a dynamically generated SQL inside an SSIS package that was causing an error. I had no way of finding out how to get this dynamic SQL (which was stored in a variable), eventually I created a secondary path that saved the variable to&#xA0; a table, where I could read it. Update: This is possible, see here for the details. The rest of this point still stand, though.Finding out why things are failing is a task for those who have little respect for their time, for SSIS insist that it is important enough to engulf all your time. Oh, and have fun getting a MESSAGE BOX from the SSIS process if a script task has thrown an exception! Obviously this message box will be hidden behind SSIS, so you will wait for the process to end for quite some time before realizing what have happened.  The missing basics: I lost count of the many things that I consider a given that SSIS doesn&#x27;t have. From date formatting to parameterized queries (to Oracle) to the basic UPSERT support. There have been a few times when I literally count not believe that it didn&#x27;t have this capability. Date formatting and parsing is a basic part of what you ought to get out of the box with an integration package, as just simple example of a basic lack that is driving me crazy. There are more, but I am going to walk the dog now.</p>
