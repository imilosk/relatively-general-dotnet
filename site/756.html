            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post was prompt by an email that was   I&#x27;ve read many things on forums regarding the architecture of an ASP.NET 2.0 application which is using NHibernate. Personally I like most the idea with service module (not necessary web service, just an assembly with the role of a service). The main idea for me is to make the asp.net application independent of the NH.Therefore I consider that asp.net app should be aware only of the Model, Service.  My main concern is how can I make this service to force NH to be transparent for the main application. What I mean with this.Some of the methods from this assembly, that will return Model objects, will use directly HQL (these ones are no problem).But I will need for sure a wrapper over the NH session, in this way NH will became unknown to the main project.  The problem in creating this wrapper.Some of the methods are very simple...for example Delete, Save, GetById.The main problem is on creating the methods for retrieving the data based on a list of conditions.  To Most of everyone agree that having something like new SqlConnection() in your business level code is not a good idea. Why then people have much less trouble with code such as this?IList&lt;Customer&gt; customers =             session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Customer))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;.List&lt;Customer&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;//process customers&#xA;Yes, this is not a valid example, because this may be a sign that you are mixing your concerns here, but bear with me here, I am not going to build a 9 layer application just for demonstration purposes. If we frown on using a SqlConnection, why is using the session much more acceptable? Isn&#x27;t something like this preferred?public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomers()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;// do query here&#x9;&#xA;}&#xA;Well, it is certainly much more explicit than the previous example, isn&#x27;t it? The problem that I have with the code above is that it usually turn to something like:public IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomers()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;using(ISession session = factory.OpenSession())&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;//transaction handling omitted for brevity&#xA;&#x9; &#x9;return session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Customer))&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;.List&lt;Customer&gt;();&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;}&#xA;The problem with that is that it misses out on one of the more important features of the platform, the Unit of Work implementation. It relegate the OR/M into a stupid tool getting/saving data from a persistence store. So, then you take the next step, and create something like IUnitOfWork, and abstract the Unit of Work implementation from the rest of the application.&#xA0;Problem solved, right?&#xA;Well, no, it isn&#x27;t. It is only &quot;solved&quot; for the very simple case. What happens when you want to do a more complex query? Or utilize features of the underlying OR/M to your best advantage.&#xA;I am going to pick LLBLGen and NHibernate as two OR/M products that have roughly similar capabilities, but radically different design. LLBLGen doesn&#x27;t use the Unit of Work pattern, for instance, so the abstraction above it fairly useless in this scenario. A lot of the stuff that you would do in one tool would be actively harmful in another. Trying to build an application in a way that would take advantage of only the basic features of the tool that you are using is a big disservice for the application, it complicate the programming model, and it wouldn&#x27;t gain you much flexibility in the end.&#xA;In my Rhino Commons library, I have two implementations of the IUnitOfWork interface, one for NHibernate, and the second for Active Record, which is NHibernate. I have explicitly made the choice to being able to take full advantage on the capabilities of NHibernate, which means that I can&#x27;t take the same code base and try to use that against another OR/M, even one that is using the Unit of Work pattern.&#xA;NHibernate is explicitly designed to be used in a way that doesn&#x27;t force a dependency between the domain model and NHibernate, but trying to abstract NHibernate from the service layer is a losing proposition. The service layer now does a translation from the NHibernate&#x27;s concepts to terms that are really NHibernate&#x27;s terms, but in the service layer&#x27;s namespace. You can&#x27;t port this code:FindAll&lt;Customers&gt;(&#xA;   new Predicate(Operator.Equality, &quot;City&quot;, &quot;London&quot;&#xA;);&#xA;As seen above, this is usually more awkward than the original syntax.&#xA;To be clear, this doesn&#x27;t mean that you can now freely scatter code all over the place that uses NHibernate directly. SoC is still king, but you should accept that trying to replace a core part of the system such as NHibernate is going to be a very costly endeavor. I have seen a few efforts where people have decided that they want to use NHibernate, but without taking a dependency on it. It was costly, confusing, and eventually abandoned, because the translation layer always had this one more feature that a developer needed that NHibernate supported. And adding this feature to the translation layer would have created 1:1 mapping between NHibernate concepts and the service layer concepts, making the whole effort pointless.&#xA;That approach also meant that you couldn&#x27;t take advantage of NHibernate&#x27;s tools such as NHibernate Query Generator, which can really make the syntax smooth.&#xA;What do I recommend, then?&#xA;&#xA;Evaluate the various OR/M implementations, and find out what fits your scenarios best.&#xA;Make full use of all the OR/M capabilities, don&#x27;t limit yourself to a strict subset because in the future you may want to replace it.&#xA;If independence from the OR/M is important to you, understand that no matter how you try, you would still have some dependencies, usually in a place that you wouldn&#x27;t look for, and that you will likely spend a lot of time on translation layer needlessly.&#xA;However, in that case, be sure to create a service layer that can express what you want to do in the terms of the domain. &#xA;What do I mean by that?&#xA;Instead of:&#xA;&#xA;session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Customer))&#xA0;&#x9;.Add(Expression.Eq(&quot;Name&quot;, london))&#xA0;&#x9;.List&lt;Customer&gt;();&#xA;Or even this:&#xA;&#xA;FindAll&lt;Customer&gt;(Where.Customer.City == london);&#xA;Which is fairly clear to read even if you are not really familiar with the syntax, try to do this:&#xA;&#xA;FindAll&lt;Customer&gt;(&#xA0; CustomerByCityFinder.With(london) );&#xA;This is an approach that can help isolate you from the complexity of the OR/M layer, but it means that you now separate the place where you do the query from the query itself. This is not a bad thing on itself, except that this is already done for you by the OR/M itself. Using NHQG, those queries are very expressive in the terms of the domain.&#xA;I reserve this approach for the more complex queries. Where the query is complex enough to have its own responsibilities.</p>

A lot of the features of XML require an extra action on the side of the parsing code, such as explicitly asking for resolving XInclude, and most of the time that is never supported by the tools. And while XSD schema &#x2B; intellisense is nice, do you really want to write something like an SSIS package using plain XML &#x2B; intellisense?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last night I commited WCF Integration&#xA0;to the Castle trunk. This is based in part on the work described here&#xA0;by Orand. The main idea here is that WCF should get the service instances from Windsor, which gives us all the usual advantages of IoC plus Windsor&#x27;s interceptors capabilities.&#xA0;It isn&#x27;t a lot of code, but it makes it much easier to work with WCF services.  Using it on a web application:  Call this in the beginning of the application (Global.Application_Start): WindsorServiceHostFactory.RegisterContainer(container);  Create a MyService.svc file and put this in it:&lt;%@ ServiceHost Service=&quot;component name in windsor&quot; &#xA;Factory=&quot;Castle.Facilities.WcfIntegration.WindsorServiceHostFactory, Castle.Facilities.WcfIntegration&quot; %&gt; &#xA;&#xA;Have fun&#xA;Using it from a non-web application:WindsorContainer windsorContainer = new WindsorContainer();&#xA;&#xA;windsorContainer.AddComponent(&quot;operations&quot;, typeof (IOperations), typeof (Operations));&#xA;Uri uri = new Uri(&quot;net.tcp://localhost/WCF.Facility&quot;);&#xA;WindsorServiceHost host = new WindsorServiceHost(windsorContainer, typeof (Operations),&#xA;                                                 uri);&#xA;host.Description.Endpoints.Add(&#xA;&#x9;new ServiceEndpoint(ContractDescription.GetContract(typeof (IOperations)),&#xA;&#x9;                    new NetTcpBinding(),&#xA;&#x9;                    new EndpointAddress(uri)));&#xA;host.Open();&#xA;Obviously you can cut down on this code significantly using the standard WCF configuration.&#xA;Another interesting thing is the ability to apply cross cutting concerns using IServiceBehavior / IEndPointBehavior. Any components that are registered with those interfaces on the container will be applied to all the services that are created this way. You can apply individual behaviors using the standard WCF means.&#xA;What is this not?&#xA;It is not here to replace WCF configuarion, and it deals specifically just with creating/disposing of services using Windsor. There are already good tools to configure WCF, and this approach takes full advantage of them.&#xA;The code has both tests and a sample site, have fun.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Ted Neward is talking about Gavin&#x27;s &quot;In Defence of the Relational Database&quot;.  Sure enough, as people (apparently in this case, myself) start to talk about approaches to persistence that don&#x27;t involve Hibernate, Gavin feels compelled to point to these other technologies using inflammatory terms and a certain amount of FUD. I think that Ted is missing the point, the post is inflammatory intentionally, in order to make it funny. There is usually a distict difference betwen an inflammatory rant to such posts. For one, it is rare a rant that can make me guffaw.  Object-relational mapping isn&#x27;t that hard, so there&#x27;s no need to eliminate it. Sorry, Gavin, but the fact is, this remains, and always will remain, a point of difference between you and I, and between you and a fairly large number of developers I&#x27;ve spoken to over the years at conferences and consulting engagements and classes. For simple table-to-class mappings, you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s a pretty simple thing. It is, however, still a &quot;dual schema&quot; problem, in that now you have two competing &quot;sources of truth&quot; that have to be reconciled to one another, the database schema, and the object model. There are two cases here, where you have a legacy DB and when you get to create your own. For the first case, the complexity of the mapping in this case depends on how messed up the database is and how far from the existing schema do you want your domain model to be. For the second case, you get to create your own, in which case you simple let the tool handle all the persistence concerns, and don&#x27;t really think about the persistence until you have to.  Oh, and the comment that &quot;If you just want to &quot;throw some objects in the database&quot;, you&#x27;ll never need to write a single mapping annotation.&quot; really sort of proves the point I try to make in the ODMG.org paper: if you just want to &quot;throw some objects in the database&quot;, why do you bother having an RDBMS in the first place? Because I need to handle imports from the Monster DB, handle queries, reports, etc. I also need to scale well for cross-machine work (the DB server is a separate machine, across the network), the OR/M is a mature technology that is based on even more mature technology. Finding bottlenecks and fixing them is very easy, you get to see the data very easiy in tools such as management studio, etc. I can probably do the same with an OODBMS, I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t have a real need for that, and RDBMS is very simple and well understood.  There are DBAs that are in open revolt at the idea, particularly since you&#x27;ve also just conveniently left out any sort of indexing or other tuning decisions that will make the database perform at all reasonably. Well, I think that the worst way to scale a database is described here, it is also one of the best answers to why I would like to move logic outside the database. I have a really nice DB schema that is generated from NHibernate, I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with having to query it, so I don&#x27;t think that a DBA would object to the schema. Ted&#x27;s point about indexing is a very good one, I prefer to leave that until later, when I actually have data in the DB and I can actually do real queries on it and see where the cost is. Premature optimization applies to DB indexes as well. The most common approach to performance with databases is to reduce the number of queries. This tend to change the queries sent to the database significantly. I don&#x27;t see a lot of value in trying to place indexes on the &quot;easy on the db, hard on the network&quot; kind of queries, which is usually what you starts with. Going for production without indexes is stupid indeed.  (It&#x27;s not like any self-respecting DBA is going to want to take your slapdash relational schema, anyway...) I would disagree strongly on that, but I would like to hear more about the reasons for that first.  ...rather than display his own benchmark that directly contradicts the benchmark offered by the OODBMS folks... Benchamrks are an inefficent way to judge performance, unless you have tailored the benchmark for the current situation. Gavin has responded to such a benchmark here, and there is a Q&amp;A about Performance in Hibernate here&#xA0;that discuss why there isn&#x27;t a standard Hibernate benchmark. Specifically: &quot;the number of variables in any decent benchmark make it almost impossible to transfer these results into reasonable conclusions about the performance of your own application&quot;  But in a situation where you&#x27;re just &quot;throwing objects into the database&quot;, and nobody else is connecting to this data (in other words, you can be tightly coupled to the data storage), why take that overhead if it&#x27;s not necessary? Choosing an out-of-proc database because &quot;somebody may want to get to this data someday&quot; is YAGNI, pure and simple. Scaling, reliability, etc. I want to run it in a web farm and have the DB clustered and failed over. As for YAGNI, I challange anyone to take any reasonably sized&#xA0;application that is using in-process DB and try to run the DB in a separate machine. The technical issues are not relevant, this is a configuration change, mostly. The main issue is that you have vastly different trade offs for in-process DB vs. out-of-process DB. Number of remote calls is the key factor here.  &quot;... the problem is that existing, mature RDBMS systems happen to not be written in Java (see Benefit #3).&quot; Ouch. Don&#x27;t let the Cloudscape developers hear you say that. Granted, HSQL is not what I&#x27;d call a &quot;heavy-duty&quot; RDBMS, but Gavin, not everything has to be stored in Oracle. Sometimes a lighter-weight database--MySQL, HSQL, Postgres, or even (gasp!) Access--is good enough. Or are you advocating that everybody should be using clustered J2EE servers to build their 5-user department calendar app? Ted, in what cases would you recommend putting a&#xA0;HSQL in production?  I also think that you are ignoring a key part of Gavin&#x27;s point. Hibernate is meant for use in scalable, high performance applications. If you need to write a 5 users department app, then Hibernate can offer a nicer programming model, but you wouldn&#x27;t care about performance, now would you? When you do care about performance, you usually move to those clusterd servers against a central (or RACed, or whatever) DB, and then you really want to have support from the tools for that.  OODBMS benchmarks suck because they measure ORM with caching turned off. As well they should, because not all ORM users can use caching. Particularly if they need to bypass the ORM for particularly sophisticated straight-up SQL queries. If you can&#x27;t use caching in your application, you are left with scaling at the database level, that hurts. And since Hibernate has a fairly sophisticated way of dropping things out of the cache if you tell it to (SessionFactory.Evict***() ) and several mechanisms that allows you to use SQL directly in Hibernate, I would say that this is invalid assumption to make.  If an O/R-M is doing more stuff than an OODBMS, but the end result is the same from the programmer&#x27;s perspective, the fact tha the O/R-M has to do more stuff shouldn&#x27;t be held against it? See the previous points, the OR/M isn&#x27;t doing more for nothing, it is doing more because it is focused on building scalable solution. So the end result is not the same at all.  The problem is with the general approach of trying to manage the associations of the object model and the fact that the complete object graph (which doesn&#x27;t have to be a hierarchy, by the way) frequently is larger than the programmer wants to pull across the wire. There are well understood solutions for that, that isn&#x27;t the real issue. The issue is that for the hierarchical queries, there isn&#x27;t a way right now to in a cross-db fashion. You can use the OR/M to do this, as shown here, and it isn&#x27;t very hard, but it would be nicer to have it baked into the OR/M itself. I guess that will have to wait until we will have a standard way of doing that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Another story from class, today I was reviewing some of the student&#x27;s code, and we run into this one:   The student is one of the keenest persons I have ever seen on removing code duplication (painful experience, I understand). But in this case, I had stopped and started using clipboard inheritence to duplicate the code. No, I have no gone insane.   The issue is in this case, removing code duplication has cause a violation of the Single Responsibility Principal. That is a bad idea. These two views had distinct responsabilities, they just happened to have identical implementations at the moment. That doesn&#x27;t means that you are free to duplicate code in the name of SRP, in this case, I would usually have something like this:   Where the implementation would live, and it would be forwarded from the views implementations. In this case, it wasn&#x27;t necessary, because shortly thereafter, I had to modify the IReturnBookView significantly :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Another discussion with Eli Lopian, check it here. I would start out by saying that I agree to what he says, especially:  It is the process that will allow us to meet future requirements. A process that will allow us to change the design as the features grow. I wouldn&#x27;t call it process, but what the hell.  This, however, I disagree:  Lets recall the TDD process:  Write Tests -&gt; Code -&gt; Refactor (Design) Notice that the Design stage is the LAST stage, it is not:  Design (For Testability) -&gt; Test -&gt; Code  In my view, the way it works is that you: Write Test (Drive Design) -&gt; Code -&gt; Refactor The idea is that writing tests is design, coding and refactoring is just making sure that it is working :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In case you didn&#x27;t notice, I don&#x27;t like XML. To be rather exact, I don&#x27;t like the way XML is used. If you are writing a document, it is a great way to skip parsing headaches, but seriously, is writing a parser that hard? Case in point, SSIS packages are just XML, but they are literally binary XML, in that I have no way of really looking inside and figuring out what is going on. Oh, I can probably put it through a prettifier and then try to have a look-see, but that is a costly endevour, and not really practical for anything beyond getting the bloody connection string out of the file. Just today I was looking at SSIS package, it was changed, but I have no idea what the change was, so I run a diff. It came back with a lot of changes, non of which told me, an occational (reluctant) dabbler of SSIS what the hell had happened. Just this, the inability to understand what the hell has changed from a diff file, is a serious offence against the maintainability of most of the &quot;no code&quot; approaches (but reams of XML). Urgh! In other news, Boo got better support for creating DSLs.</p>
