            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My current project has a huge dependency on Windsor. Basically everything that goes on has to go through Windsor. This has made my life a lot simpler, but I just today noticed something interesting. Sometimes at the beginning of the application, we have defined the core services (logging, authorization authentication, etc) and then we forgot about them. What do I mean by that? Well, I mean that after the initial setup, we have continued to develop the application, but because of the way Windsor is structured, and because I have some defaults in the application (auto-configure controllers, for instance), it has literally been: Create new controller, expose dependencies in the constructor, move on to the real use case. Everything just falls into place without much thought, and it matches correctly. I am very pleased with the way it turned out. :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This comment by Stefan Wenig really made me think:  ...the elephant in the kitchen is the fact that there is no process for discussing c# enhancements within the community before everything is written in stone. The way you&#x27;re designing C# seems to work better in some aspects than the java community process, so I&#x27;m not sure how far you should really go. But getting feedback and discussing suggestions early is definitely overdue. The community seems to have very little influence on the choices made at Microsoft. We can make suggestions in MS Connect and for all intents and purposes they are ignored there after.&#xA0;There may be something going on behind the scenes, but I want to be able to take part in a discussion, not a popularity contest with arbitrary and contrary judges that I never get to talk to. Again, Stefan make the case very clearly in another comment:  As for the discussion process, I know that there are ways, but they basically all suck. I can make suggestions at connect, but that&#x27;s no place to discuss stuff. I&#x27;m not talking about voting either, things like AOP are far too complicated to be discussed in this matter. I&#x27;d like to see a discussion between language geeks inside and outside of MSFT, voices from framework developers (the nhibernate/castle kind) and application developers, etc. This is all happening in the blogosphere - except that it&#x27;s fragmented and the C# team is not really participating.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The title comes from one of the students, when asked why we should choose an MVC approach to building simple UI. After he said that I repeated that six or seven times, I like this term. As an aside, I am having a lot of fun just pumping out all the odd &amp; ends that I have tried, and it is interesting to see have to explain to beginners the reasoning behind what drive me decisions. By the way, the code for the sample application is here: https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rhino-tools/trunk/SampleApplications/Course And you can see what we have done so far here: https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rhino-tools/trunk/SampleApplications/Course/Docs/The_Library_Application.pdf  This is an approach that I took in order to expose the students to as many ideas (vs. knowledge) on the framework and design. Nothing like throwing recursive delegates at someone to keep them on their toes :-) Please remember that this is a work in progress and is not meant to represent what I consider best practices or correct way to code, it is code that is written partially by me, partially by the students, and I don&#x27;t have R# at class* so I am limited to what I can do. Also, keep in mind that the PDF (and the presentation in the same directory) are intended for people who have been through the previous lessons, so it may not make much sense on its&#xA0; own. * On purpose, I don&#x27;t really have much control over the speed I am writing code, and having R# there would make understanding how the code work very hard.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, I got my phsycic hat today, and I wanted to refer to Frans&#x27;&#xA0;post and try to answer the question that Frans is asking:            Roger:         9. Provide read-only access to foreign key values.             Mike:         This is actually a feature I&#x2019;m fighting to get into our final milestone for V1. Can you describe the scenarios where this is used? Do you need the ability to query on the foreign key value, or simply expose it on the domain object?             If I have an Order entity object in memory, if I want to obtain its CustomerID and I only have the ability to get that ID is by fetching the related Customer entity into memory, instead of doing Order.CustomerID, I lose performance which is unnecessary. It&#x27;s simple data-access stuff and it puzzles me a bit why Mike has to put up a fight to get this into their framework in the first place. Especially since the underlying object context knows that Order.CustomerID as it has to save it to the DB if you change the Customer related to that particular Order instance.         I should mention that I know very little about the way the Entity Framework internals work, but I would like to make an educated guess about the reasons for this issue, and why it is appernatly hard to do for V1.    The problem is basically this:            Order&#xA0;order&#xA0;=&#xA0;GetOrderFromDatabase();        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Order&#x27;s&#xA0;Customer&#xA0;ID:&#xA0;{0}&quot;,&#xA0;order.Customer.CustomerID);        Now, the Entity Framework is apperantely not able to handle this case without loading the entire customer entity, which isn&#x27;t really not needed, since you already have loaded the CustomerID column when you loaded the Order entity.    The reason that this is likely hard (again, I am making guesses here) is that the EF uses code generation where other frameworks use interception, and&#xA0;I assume that there isn&#x27;t really a good way to detect when the identifier property is access and when it is a normal property (that does require loading the object). This likely means that trying to access the Customer entity when it is not loaded would throw, and trying to deal with that would force the EF to handle lazy loading, which is something that they seem to want to push to the client, rather than the framework.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is an integration story. Once upon a time there was the need to integrate between two systems. A meeting (blah!) was scheduled and it was decided that web services are an appropriate integration technology. Fast forward some time, and now you get&#xA0;a strange situation where the other side has found that they are unable to use web services because of technical limitations in Java. Sound suspicious to me, but whatever. How do you suppose we will integrate, then? Well, they know how to talk to a database... So, they can&#x27;t figure out web services but you want to talk to my database? I don&#x27;t think so. But you can add security and stored procedures and then they would not be able to do any harm. So, because they are incompetent, I need to start managing security in the database layer? I don&#x27;t think so. create database Application_Integration; Here is the user/pass, enjoy. Abstraction is for more&#xA0;than just code. Now I wonder how long it would take them to complain that I don&#x27;t do any work because I have a single table in the database.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">From Kevin, the OR/M Wars: Now there are is a lot of uproar at the moment from the NHibernate Mafia (as termed in DotNetRocks) slamming everything that isn&#x27;t there WAY. First, Richard &amp; Carl, I believe the terms belongs to you - I am going to send a triple nested cursors with Cartesian products to your database as a revenge. Second, I am rarely the kind of guy that would simply ignore something that he doesn&#x27;t agree on. I don&#x27;t think that there is any slamming involved in the discussions we are having, merely an opinionated argument, and I like those because they make me think. Kevin&#x27;s mentions that he evaluated NHibernate and Active Record, and he doesn&#x27;t think that they will speed up development. I would like to know why, but that is a totally acceptable stand, especially when it is given from a position of someone that tried it.  The biggest thing that seems to set the NHibernate people off is using the database as anything more than a means for object persistence. What if I want to use the flash XML features or SQL 2k5? CLR types? If you have a big expensive database damn sure use it. Give me a use case, and I&#x27;ll give you an answer, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much you can get out of an OR/M when you put your mind to it. And yes, there will be cases when I will say, &quot;that is a valid use case, use the DB directly for that&quot;. Otherwise you could just have one table in the database and serialize out your objects to and from the db. That way you never have to worry about relational data or normalizing a database or tuning a database. Not really a good approach, &quot;Give me all the users registered last week&quot; and see you next week. What is really important, however, is this: Now the thing that worries me most though seems to be the venom in the both some of the posts and some of the comments. In general, I think that the discussion was being professional and educating. There were some incidents, but we are all friends now :-) I don&#x27;t like confrontational situations, they lead to violence and they I have to do paperwork, so I have a vested interest in keeping the discussion professional.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Just to clarify, the other side of this post&#xA0;in this one. Rob Conery&#xA0;says that he landed on my bad side. Allow me to clarify, I may disagree with with Rob, but I like this types of discussions. Oh, and Rob, in the last week I posted 55 posts,&#xA0;5 of which were about this discussion. Considering that this is usually how much I post in a week month, and considering that this is a topic which is (a) near and dear to my heart, (b) I disagree with Rob on this matter, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see more coming soon. I actually have one that I still need to work on, regarding Rob&#x27;s to Evan&#x27;s post. What sucks is that ORM can easily be abused The universe keeps producing better idiots, it is a shame, I know. By the way, I agree with the spirit of what Rob is saying, except that I don&#x27;t agree with the examples that he is using. Basically, going anywhere blinding is a bad approach, you should really learn the stack that you are using and be able to utilize every part of it. Closing off options because of dogma is a really bad place to be when the shit hit the fan.</p>
