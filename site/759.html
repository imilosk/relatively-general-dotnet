            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jacob Proffitt has another post, called Tilting at Windmill&#xA0;that expound on this subject, and Nate Kohari&#xA0;has a good response to Jacob&#x27;s first post here. In this post, Jacob starts with:  I&#x2019;ve been giving poor Nate Kohari a hard time over at Discord &amp; Rhyme. He has been very patient in Defending Dependency Injection. His attitude stands in sharp contrast to Ayende Rahien&#x27;s post today about testing Linq for SQL. Ayende&#x2019;s snide &quot;(Best Practices, anyone?)&quot; is exactly the attitude I lamented in my original post on Dependency Injection Jacob, yes, I fully believe that it is a best practice to be able to test code without using a hammer (TypeMock)&#xA0;to force the dependencies into order. And as I have already mention, I am doing quite a lot of stuff with dependency injection &amp; inversion of control that explicitly require separating the dependencies. Seams are just that, seams where I can put my own stuff, be it a mock object or a decorator or a proxy. They are incredibly useful in reducing the amount of concerns that I need to deal with at any given point. Jacob then continues to:  My hypothesis (entirely untestable, so technically a mere speculation) is that what happened is that in order to achieve 100% code coverage in their unit tests with methods that read databases or call web services or have other potentially nasty dependencies, someone came up with the neat idea to invert control of those dependencies so that unit tests could feed in an abstracted object that fakes those calls and the real logic of the methods could be tested without bothering the poor database (or whatever). That&#x2019;s a noticeable, pervasive, broad architectural change, though, especially if it is only used for unit testing, so in order to defend their idea, developers began looking for additional justification for this pattern. I don&#x27;t think that you will find anyone accomplished in unit testing that would say that achieving 100% coverage is a goal that you should strive for. In fact, you are usually explicitly warned from chasing that number just because is a nice round shiny one. Hell, Rhino Mocks itself has only 95% coverage, and I am not worried about it in the least. Dependency Injection &amp; Mocking often goes hand in hand, but they don&#x27;t need to be, and I value DI because I use it in conjunction with IoC, which means that I really don&#x27;t need to think about dependencies at all. That is a much better solution than any other alternative:  Seriously, with providers that allow you to contextualize defined sub-systems and something that allowed you to Mock objects in testing without having to feed those objects to the tested class, can you think of a good reason to use Dependency Injection? Providers are just an abstract factory with a static access, not really anything new. In fact, it is a service locator that can locate a single server. That means that I don&#x27;t have easy visibility for my dependency map. If I look at a class, I can see at a glance what it is dependant on when using DI, not so when I am using the static accessors. It also mean that I have no ability to pick &amp; choose what the dependencies that I will pass to my objects. Jacob&#x27;s answer to that is:  Any dependency that needs to be altered more frequently than a contextual provider framework would allow needs to be exposed for access by calling objects anyway, I&#x2019;m thinking. And who shoulder the burden of handling that? Who decide what should use what? I prefer&#xA0;a consistent approach, aided by smart tools, which, in the end, means that I have to spend little to no time thinking and managing dependencies. In fact, in most scenarios, you quickly forget that you even use DI, because that is so natural and the framework simply supports what you do. Trying to look at DI alone, without seeing how it is used in practice means that you miss the overall picture.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jacob Proffitt has&#xA0;a&#xA0;post&#xA0;about Dependency Injection, which he doesn&#x27;t seem to like very much.  The real reason that DI has become so popular lately, however, has nothing to do with orthogonality, encapsulation, or other &quot;purely&quot; architectural concerns. The real reason that so many developers are using DI is to facilitate Unit Testing using mock objects. Talk around it all you want to, but this is the factor that actually convinces bright developers to prefer DI over simpler implementations.  I do wish that people would admit that DI doesn&#x2019;t have compelling applicability outside of Unit Testing, however. I&#x2019;m reading articles and discussions lately that seem to take the superiority of DI for granted While the ability to easily mock the code is a nice property, it is almost a side benefit to the main benefits, which is getting low coupling between our objects. I get to modify my data access code without having to touch the salary calculation engine, that is the major benefit I get. I have had more than one occasion to experience the result of not doing so, and I have seen the benefits of breaking the application to highly independent components that collaborate together to create a working whole. Take that and join it with a powerful container (such as Windsor), and suddenly you gain a whole new insight into the way you are constructing your application, because the moment you are tunneling a lot of the dependencies through a single source, you find that there are a lot of smart things that you can do. Decorators, interceptors and proxies come immediately to mind, but there are quite a few other options as well.  All of this becomes particularly exasperating in the dead silence regarding TypeMock. Type Mock is a great library, and you can check this blog to see my discussion with Eli Lupian about it. The main weakness of Type Mock is its power, it allow me to take shortcuts that I don&#x27;t want to take, I want to get a system with low coupling and high cohesion. And from the comments to that post, again by Jacob:  How can you say that dependency injection (I&#x27;m not taking on the whole inversion of control pattern, but I might. Jury&#x27;s still out on that one.) creates loosely coupled units that can be reused easily when the whole point of DI is to require the caller to provide the callee&#x27;s needs? Because there isn&#x27;t a coupling from the unit to its dependencies, and there shouldn&#x27;t be a coupling between the caller to the callee&#x27;s dependencies. But even without the use of an IoC container, you can get a lot of benefit from DI, just the ability to pass a CachingDbConnection instead of&#xA0;an IDbConnection is very valuable, and not, this is not something that you can just put in some sort of a factory or provider, because you want that kind of decision to be made on case by case basis.  Ugh. I wish Ayende would admit that the only advantage to DI in his examples is to allow the mock objects to work, is all. There is no other compelling reason. Sorry, but I don&#x27;t think that this is the case at all. Dependency Injection isn&#x27;t (just) for testing, it is to Enable Change.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Mats (NPersist) is talking about Saving to Blob, basically suggesting that you can turn your persistence strategy into Table(Id, Blob):  An alternative would be to serialize the non-identity fields into a blob of some kind and save that to just one column in the database. The database table would then have primary key columns matching the identity fields and then just one more blob column for the serialized non-identity fields of the object. Since this basically prevent any useful filtering on the data, he suggest that you can extract columns outside the blob, much in the way we currently do with indexes. As far as I am concerned, this is the worst possible persistence strategy. It means that you have taken some of the great strengths of the database and turned it into a stupid file server, for no real benefit. Mats suggest that this can have positive performance implications, but I doubt that this is the case. Just consider the cost of doing something as simple as providing a sortable, paged,&#xA0;grid using this approach. If the user has chosen to sort on a column that is inside the blob, then you would need to pull all the table in memory, sort it, and then hand the application just the page it is interested in. It also completely destroy the possibility of working with the database with database oriented tools. I can go into my DBs and look at the tabular data, but 0x20495bacfca12312 doesn&#x27;t have much meaning to me. ETL tools, reporting, etc are going to become useless. Not to mention that now you are in versioning hell. Serialization is notoriously difficult to handle correct across versions, and to have all the data in the DB in a format that is sensitive to serialization is quite a problem. Handling associations between objects is another issue, I can use the DB&#x27;s FK capabilities if I am using the standard mode, but a blob can have no FK enforcement by the DB.&#xA0; In fact, I can&#x27;t really think of a good reason to do this, and I can think of plenty of reasons not to. As far as I know, there were &quot;Object &lt;-&gt; Blob Mappers&quot; on the Java side at one time, and they are one of the points that always come up when an argument about OR/M come up, because that is a really bad way to handle this requirement.  Note: There is a really good article on this issue with Java Serialized Objects &amp; Reporting that I have read a few years ago in an Oracle site, but I can&#x27;t find it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most common issues that people have run into with using NHQA is the DuplicateMappingException. The root problem is that you are adding both the DLL (which contained embedded resources mapping files) and the mapping files themselves.  Well, after getting tried of answering that question so often, I decided to fix the issue, and let NHQA knows about the issue, and try to resolve it. The fix is in the repository now, but I would like to have some more input before I would release it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note: I am writing this post in the express hope that it would help to change the current situation. I have been just recently informed about a significant problem with Linq for SQL. It doesn&#x27;t support testing easily. You can see the bug report here, and as usual, it was closed as Won&#x27;t Fix without even providing an explanation. Did I mention already that I don&#x27;t like Connect&#x27;s approach to it? Yes, I did. The root problem is a fairly simple one. Linq for SQL relies on reams of generated code, which means that if I have code line this:  var customers = from c in context.Customers &#xA;  select c;&#xA;Then I have no really easy way to mock what is going on in here. The generated code provides a concrete class without an interface, so it is very hard to mock, and naturally, System.Data.Linq.Table&lt;T&gt; is sealed, has internal stuff, and is utterly hostile to mocking.&#xA;You have to use mocking if you&#xA0; want to use the code above without hitting the database, and this is a core part of the way a lot of people work. Linq for SQL doesn&#x27;t take that into account.&#xA;The requirement for mocking aren&#x27;t really that onerous, we need and interface generated for the context class, and interface for Table&lt;T&gt; and that the generated code will default to using interfaces by default (Best Practices, anyone?).&#xA;Having to write adapters classes is something that TDDers on the .Net platform has become very familiar with, because of the insistence of using untestable practices throughout the framework. I am fairly tired of that, and I would certainly like to be able to skip this tiring process for once.&#xA;It is shocking to me that in this day and age the Linq for SQL team can still believe utterly ignore such practices and put hurdles in the path of easy testability. &#xA;Are we back to demos vs. reality development?&#xA;To finish, this bug has been closed, so it is not possible even to vote for it. At the very least, I would like to hear an explanation, and it had better not involved &quot;lack of resources&quot;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have currently stopped working on the UI for Rhino ETL, and it is an interesting experience. In the past, I have usually started with building the functionality and then adding the UI for it. That failed. The problem wasn&#x27;t that the functionality wasn&#x27;t there, it was that the UI wasn&#x27;t nice enough for use, or wasn&#x27;t pretty enough to attract. This time, I am doing it in reverse, I am building the UI first, at least the rough draft of it, and then I intend to go and hook everything up. This means that while the picture on the right looks very nice, it is mostly skeleton with nice UI, without much functionality. Right now it is just an editor for Rhino ETL scripts, but I am currently hooking up the requirements for a project system that would allow me to build some really interesting functionality on top of the scripts. You can see some of the ideas that I have in the live view pane, which should allow me to visualize everything in the project for ease of use. Doing it the other way around is not likely to be possible, sadly, except in the most trivial cases, so I think that I will skip that. Anyway, the point of this post is that by giving it a good looking UI, I make myself feel much better about the application. Working on an ugly application is distasteful, and you tend to just try to get away. Working on pretty ones make you want to improve the current state.  That is the whole No Broken Windows mentality again, by the way, as well as some self motivation practices. Beside, and that is a secret, working on the UI allows me to consider the back end in a very detailed way without getting too low level. Almost by accident, there is this Daily WTF post&#xA0;about just this issue. Insightful is not something that I use lightly with regards to the Daily WTF posts, but this one is certainly is. If you possibly can, make it pretty, you, your users, and the application will be thankful.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Smalltalk had it right from the start, when I want to explore a system, I want to explore a live system, once I can interact with and get immediate results. REPL systems are very good (those are live interpreters, such as boo, perl, python, ruby, etc has) for exploring, but today the requirement for Liveness was brought home very clearly when I needed to work with some web service I knew nothing about. Now, I could have looked at the WSDL, and tried to figure out what it means (either by looking at the WSDL itself or looking at the generated code), but I didn&#x27;t, that was a chore. It was much easier to make a call to the web service, stop in the debugger, and analyze the results with quick watch. With all the noise around dynamic languages, I fully expect that this would once again be a common model to work with.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is mostly a maintenance release, to get the code out the door before it eats me. As you can see, there has been quite a few changes, most of them are bug fixes, but there are some new features. A side note, I have had 34,034 downloads for the 3.1 version, Wow! As usual, you can get it here. Features:  Applied patch from Robert Angres, adding TraceWriterExpectationLogger Applying patch for With.Mocks fluent interface from Tobias Grimm Applied patch from Tobias Grimm that adds support for: With.Mocks(...).ExpectInSameOrder(...).Verify() Adding a way to have more granularity on what BackToRecord will revert. EventRaiser.Create() Adding EventRaiser.Raise(sender, e) overload, for better intelli sense support. Playback disposable will check for an exception and avoid the VerifyAll if there was one. Bugs  Disable calling LastCall.Constraints more than once. Better error message on LastCall, will point the user to the option of non virtual method call being made. Fixed bug: stub with properties that return value types must have the value set before it can be get. Fixing mocking generic methods with generic class constraint Fixing mocking of internal properties of internal types Applied patch from Josh Flanagan, do not consider the value of an out parameter when creating default constraint. Passing a null to a params parameter would throw null reference exception. Fixing a bug where Stub would not stub the base class / interface properties. Should throw exception on verify if Repeat.Never was called. Better error messages when calling EventRaiser.Raise() incorrectly. Applying Adam Tybor patch, removing warning from the build and setting DelegateTargetInterfaceCreator creation assembly to be a signed one. Fixing an issue with stubbing generic types. Fixing minor issues with EventRaiser error handling Better error message when using specifying a return value and setting Repeat.Never</p>
