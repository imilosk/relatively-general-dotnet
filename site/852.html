            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Paul Stovel talks about defaulting to making your code public (accessible to developer). There is nothing more infuriating than looking at the exact code you need in Reflector, yet not being able to call it yourself.     I said it before, many times, and I fully agree with him on that.     Scott Hansleman&#xA0;reponded: When you&#x27;re designing for Users, you do a usability study. When you&#x27;re designing for Developers, you need do a a developability study.     Yes, and when you give me six months and real world use cases, then maybe you can get something out of it. You aren&#x27;t hitting the need of those until you are really deep in complex scenarios. Scenarios that aren&#x27;t going to be covered in any shorter time frame. It is not the scenarios that you thought of when you design the framework that worries me. It is the scenario of needing to integrate the way I work with a new framework and finding out that I need to modify the existing functionality just a little bit, and then finding the hood welded shut. Brian theorized that they didn&#x27;t need as much extensibility as they thought, and shipped a internally basically sealed version. When folks needed something marked virtual, they put it in a queue. The next internal version shipped with something like 7 methods in one class marked virtual - meeting the needs of all - when originally the developers thought they wanted over 50 points of extensibility.     Scott, this is for an internal application, used by several dozens of developers, building most the same kind of applications, right? What Paul is talking about, and I fully cuncur him, is that when you don&#x27;t have a release cycle that is measure in days/weeks, and when your target audiance is far more diverse, you need all those extention points.     In the comments to Scott&#x27;s post, Joshua Flanagan&#xA0;suggests: public override unsupported void Foo(); // overriding a non-virtual method             Widget x = new Widget();         x.$InternalHelper(); // call a non-public method on an object     I have issues with the syntax, but I agree with the idea, for myself, I use the [ThereBeDragons] attribute.     A good point that was raised in this issue was that exposing everything limits extensibility and will hurt forward compatability. As much as I like those terms, they are not sacred. In the name of the Holy Backward Compatability, Microsoft refuses to fix this bug: TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(typeof(int)).IsValid(&quot;abcd&quot;)&#xA0;==&#xA0;true     Is there anyone reading this that thinks that this is a valid approach?! In the name of forward compatability, this approach hurts the developers far more than it helps. In the commercial world, there is such a fuss about Supported vs. Not Supported anyway, so it is not an issue. The framework vendor should have the balls to say, &quot;Breaking Changes&quot; and deal with it.     Thinking that you can control software once it is outside the gate is silly. If I need this functionality, I will get it. Take a look at my SqlCommandSet, huge performance improvement that the ADO.Net team didn&#x27;t see a reason to expose to the outside world. Of course that they didn&#x27;t see a reason, no one tried to build a OR/M framework on 2.0 Alpha/Beta/Gamma until very late into the game, and they didn&#x27;t encounter the batching performance implications until very late into the game.     Microsoft is very good in saying &quot;This is unsupported scenario&quot; (recent example, putting Atlas&#x27; assemblies on the GAC, rather than on the application base, which completely breaks continious integration scenarios) - they should learn to say &quot;unsupported extensability&quot; and move on, instead of slapping sealed and internal over everything and anything in sight. Strangely, on the Java world, where everything is virtual by default, people still do manage to issue a second version of their software. So I don&#x27;t see a big issue there.    Note that I am not saying not to use internal, I use it myself, but usually for very different reasons. To hide complexity or remove things from direct reach. In 95% of the cases, if I have internal, I have a public way of safely overriding it (and if I don&#x27;t, it is a bug, page me).    Let me give an example of a scenario that you wouldn&#x27;t think about until late into development. I have a static IoC class that holds the reference to the IoC container that I am using. Part of the initialization process of my container recursively uses itself to load stuff. I need to replace the container dynamically, but then I hit a problem. I can&#x27;t fully initalize the container because if I do, it will use the previous container and not its own, and I can&#x27;t replace the global container because I have other threads that are running and might access the still-initalizing container and break. This is not something that you are going to run into until very late in the game, and if you can&#x27;t fix this issue, then it is Game Over replace everything from scratch.    Until I run into this scenario, I would have never thought that I would need a seperate container (accessibly globaly) side-by-side with the global container. But I did, and if I had been limited to the external interface, there would have been hell to pay for it.    Make everything public, and only interalize stuff after a lot of careful thought and agonizing decision process. Other people will use your stuff, be polite to them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">NCache&#xA0;has a new version out, and while the freature list seems really impressive, they added support to clustered, fail over caching. I have strong issues with any application where caching is mission critical to the point where you need to cluster it for reliability.    To me, this points to one of two things:            You are Google (and they have other solutions to this).            You rely on the cache to an extent that the application can&#x27;t perform at all without it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I get handed a lot of resumes, and I developed a system to speed-evaluate the resumes.&#xA;&#xA;Quickly scan the recuiter&#x27;s stuff, see if they have some personal stuff about it, but ignore the fluff about the technologies that the candidate used (according to them).Reason: They tend to put everything there. I suspect that the method they use is to ask a candidate if he every heard about SQL Server, and then put &quot;Worked with SQL Server, Stored Procedures, Triggers, Indexes&quot; instead. Perhaps they fail to understand the difference. I consider myself proficent in SQL Server, and I wrote two triggers in my life. There is no need to put stuff like this in every resume, it just end up being skipped.&#xA;Go to the projects part, see if they have done anything interesting. Interesting being define as hard / rare. Usually, I search for doing stuff with multiply threads, AI, big systems, etc. No hard rule here.&#xA;Languages, ignore any langauge that they know aside of C# and C&#x2B;&#x2B;. C# because it is what we are hiring (although I have no issues with getting a VB guy) and C&#x2B;&#x2B; because I think that it is something that give tremendous help in understanding what is going on under the hood. I don&#x27;t care what other langauges the candidate has managed to dredge from the bottomless pit of history. That they know HTML, JavaScript, VBScript, Ada, Pascal, and Shell Script is interesting for diversity, but doesn&#x27;t influence decision otherwise.&#xA;Technologies, don&#x27;t really care about that. It is nice if they have experiance there, but we can just teach an emlpyee that ourselves.I am interested in seeing that they have a diverse background (at least it shows that they can learn well)&#xA;High notes:&#xA;&#xA;Mentioning&#xA0;unit testing, agile&#xA0;experiance&#xA0;or continious integration give a 10x of an interview.&#xA;Working with open source software - just about any experiance with open source tools / frameworks is going to get a notice from me. The reason here is that it means that they manages to escape the evil clutches of Microsft Is The Source Of All Software mantra, which is at the very least very helpful.&#xA;Being a member of an open source project - this one gets you an interview, period.This is not an altruistic move on my side, by the way. If you work on open source software it usually means that you are doing it on your own time. This, in turn, means that you care about the software. It also means that I can instantly see your code and check what kind of a developer you are. And, of course, that you are cofident enough in your abilities to make your code public*. It also makes you part of the community, which is very valuable.&#xA;The candidate has a blog about software - also get an interview, period. For much the same reason that an OSS project does.&#xA;Sadly, I get a lot of really bad resumes / people. I would like to take this chance to announce again, if you are in Israel, and you are looking for a job as a software developer, give me a call or send me your resume**. Both my email and my phone are on the web site, and I would love to hear from you.&#xA;* As an aside, it also means that you probably don&#x27;t suffer from &quot;That is my code that you just touched!&quot;&#xA;** And if I don&#x27;t return to you within one day, it means that your email is in the spam folder or I&#x27;m dead. Try sending it again.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I look at a lot of resumes, and one of the things that catches my eyes in &quot;Design Patterns&quot;. So, several time, when I had an interview with a candidate that had this in his resume, I ask them what design patterns they know. Invariably, the question produce the following response:&#xA;&quot;Uh... (deep, frantic thought) Singleton!&quot; &#xA;A guy interviewing for a team lead job manages to recall Factory after a very long thought.&#xA;Bzzt, Wrong! I don&#x27;t care what GoF says, Singleton is not a design pattern. If that is the only thing you know, don&#x27;t put it in your resume.&#xA;If you do, expect to be asked about the good/bad of it and giving me &quot;only a single instnace&quot; isn&#x27;t going to help you any. &#xA;Putting design patterns on your resume means that you know what Decorator is, when to use Observer (and why it is rarer in .Net than in Java), how to implement Strategy properly, that you can convince me that I should use&#xA0; Front Controller&#xA0;instead of Page Controller, that you can tell me why Model View Controller is a good approach for this app, and why I should avoid using Transaction Script&#xA0;for a complex application.&#xA;It means that you can talk knowledgly about it. Preferably, that you have implemented (and understood) it.&#xA;Singleton is not a design pattern, if that is all you know, don&#x27;t bother to put design patterns in your resume.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Joshua Flanagan has a post where he shows a really nice solution to the problem of incomprehensible regular expressions here.&#xA0;Great Use Of Fluent Interfaces.    The very simple example is finding a US SSN: &#xA0; Regex socialSecurityNumberCheck = new Regex(@&quot;^\d{3}-?\d{2}-?\d{4}$&quot;);     Which turns out to be:                         &#xA0; &#xA0; Regex socialSecurityNumberCheck = new Regex(Pattern.With.AtBeginning                             &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; .Digit.Repeat.Exactly(3)                             &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; .Literal(&quot;-&quot;).Repeat.Optional                             &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; .Digit.Repeat.Exactly(2)                             &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; .Literal(&quot;-&quot;).Repeat.Optional                             &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; .Digit.Repeat.Exactly(4)                             &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; .AtEnd);                 Here is the output from The Regulator about the above regex:^ (anchor to start of string)    Any digit         Exactly 3 times    -    ? (zero or one time)    Any digit         Exactly 2 times    -    ? (zero or one time)    Any digit         Exactly 4 times    $ (anchor to end of string)    Comparing the two, they are nearly identical. Which is impressive, since I use Regulator all the time to deal with regexes.    What it more, for about the first time ever, this allow me to consider building a regular expression on the fly. I can&#x27;t think of a good use case to do this, of course, but now I can.    Very impressive.</p>

One of the biggest hurdles so far has been the install for NHibernate Query Generator.&#xA0;I don&#x27;t know zlit about MSI, installers, etc. So I tried to take WixEdit, Votice and SharpDevelop and create a very simple Wix script that can install NQG. Took me longer than it would have taken to write an installer myself, I suspect, but I finally managed to do it.    I then turned to the skinning of the installer. I just have an issue with the default computer &amp; disk images that 99% of the installers use. I dug up my log psd file, got the latest photoshop trial (I tried using the GIMP, horrible horrible results), and produced the following:            Pretty good for someone that can&#x27;t draw a straight line with a ruler and three hours.</p>
