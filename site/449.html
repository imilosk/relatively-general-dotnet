            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got repeated calls for doing a RavenDB in Israel, and it really makes little sense not to do one here, since it is the one we would have the easiest time running.  Therefor, I am pleased to announce that our two days RavenDB course is going to open in Israel on the 11 &#x2013; 12 July. We are going to do the course in our offices in Hadera, and part of the course will include interaction with the actual development team.  You can register for the course using the following link. We provide early bird registration until the 16th May. The course is going to be in English, and is open for people from outside of Israel as well.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It is interesting to note that for a long while, what we were trying to do with RavenDB was make it use less and less resources. One of the reasons for that is that less resources is obviously better, because we aren&#x2019;t wasting anything. The other reason is that we have users running us on a 512MB/650 MHz Celeron 32 bit machines. So we really need to be able to fit into a small box (and also allow enough processing power for the user to actually do something with the machine). We have gotten really good in doing that, actually.  The problem is that we also have users running RavenDB on standard server hardware (32 GB / 16 cores, RAID and what not) in which case they (rightly) complain that RavenDB isn&#x2019;t actually using all of their hardware. Now, being conservative about resource usage is generally good, and we do have the configuration in place which can tell RavenDB to use more memory. It is just that this isn&#x2019;t polite behavior.  RavenDB in most cases shouldn&#x2019;t require anything special for you to run, we want it to be truly a zero admin database. The solution?&#xA0; Take into account the system state and increase the amount of work that we do to get things done. And yes, I am aware of the pitfalls. As long as there is enough free RAM available, we will increase the amount of documents that we are going to index in a single batch. That is subject to some limits (for example, if we just created a new index on a big database, we need to make sure we aren&#x2019;t trying to load it entirely to memory), and it knows how to reserve some room for other things, and how to throttle down and as well as up. This post is written before I had the chance to actually test this on production level size dataset, but I am looking forward to seeing how it works.  Update: Okay, that is encouraging, it looks like what we did just made things over 7 times faster. And this isn&#x2019;t a micro benchmark, this is when you throw this on a multi GB database with full text search indexing. Next, we need to investigate what we are going to do about multiple running indexes and how this optimization affects them. Fun .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As I said in my previous post, tasked with having to load 3.1 million files into RavenDB, most of them in the 1 &#x2013; 2 KB range.  Well, the first thing I did had absolutely nothing to do with RavenDB, it had to do with avoiding dealing with this:  As you can see, that is a lot.  But when the freedb dataset is distributed, what we have is actually:   This is a tar.bz2, which we can read using the SharpZipLib library. The really interesting thing is that reading the archive (even after adding the cost of decompressing it) is far faster than reading directly from the file system. Most file systems do badly on large amount of small files, and at any rate, it is very hard to optimize the access pattern to a lot of small files. However, when we are talking about something like reading a single large file? That is really easy to optimize and significantly reduces the cost on the input I/O. Just this step has reduced the cost of importing by a significant factor, we are talking about twice as much as before, and with a lot less disk activity.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the things that is really important for us in RavenDB is the notion of Safe by Default and Zero Admin. What this means is that we want to make sure that you don&#x2019;t really have to think about what you are doing for the common cases, RavenDB will understand what you mean and figure out what is the best way to do things. One of the cases where RavenDB does that is when we need to generate new ids. There are several ways to generate new ids in RavenDB, but the most common one, and the default, is to use the hilo algorithm. It basically (ignoring concurrency handling) works like this: var currentMax = GetMaxIdValueFor(&quot;Disks&quot;);&#xA;var limit = currentMax &#x2B; 32;&#xA;SetMaxIdValueFor(&quot;Disks&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And now we can generate ids in the range of currentMax to currentMax&#x2B;32, and we know that no one else can generate those ids. Perfect! &#xA;The good thing about it is that now we have a reserved range, we can create ids without going to the server. The bad thing about it is that we now reserved a range of 32. If we create just one or two documents and then restart, we would need to request a new range, and the rest of that range would be lost. That is why the default range value is 32. It is small enough that gaps aren&#x2019;t that important*, but it since in most applications, you usually create entities on an infrequent basis and when you do, you usually generate just one, then it is big enough to still provide a meaningful optimization with regards to the number of times you have to go to the server.&#xA;&#xA;* What does it means, &#x201C;gaps aren&#x2019;t important&#x201D;? The gaps are never important to RavenDB, but people tend to be bothered when they see disks/1 and disks/2132 with nothing in the middle. Gaps are only important for humans.&#xA;So this is perfect for most scenarios. Except one very common scenario, bulk import.&#xA;When you need to load a lot of data into RavenDB, you will very quickly note that most of the time is actually spent just getting new ranges. More time than actually saving the new documents takes, in fact.&#xA;Now, this value is configurable, so you can set it to a higher value if you care for it, but still, that was annoying. &#xA;Hence, what we have now. Take a look at the log below:&#xA;&#xA;It details the requests pattern in a typical bulk import scenario. We request an id range for disks, and then we request it again, and again, and again.&#xA;But, notice what happens as times goes by (and not that much time) before RavenDB recognizes that you need bigger ranges, and it gives you them. In fact, very quickly we can see that we only request a single range per batch, because RavenDB have optimized itself based on our own usage pattern.&#xA;Kinda neat, even if I say so myself.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">On my last post, I descried the following problem:  And stated that the following trivial solution is the wrong approach to the problem: select d.* from Designs d &#xA; join ArchitectsDesigns da on d.Id = da.DesignId&#xA; join Architects a on da.ArchitectId = a.Id&#xA;where a.Name = @name&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The most obvious reason is actually that we are thinking too linearly. I intentionally showed the problem statement in terms of UI, not in terms of a document specifying what should be done.&#xA;The reason for that is that in many cases, a spec document is making assumptions that the developer should not. When working on a system, I like to have drafts of the screens with rough ideas about what is supposed to happen, and not much more.&#xA;In this case, let us consider the problem from the point of view of the user. Searching by the architect name makes sense to the user, that is usually how they think about it.&#xA;But does it makes sense from the point of view of the system? We want to provide good user experience, which means that we aren&#x2019;t just going to provide the user with a text box to plug in some values. For one thing, they would have to put in the architect full name as it is stored in our system. That is going to be a tough call in many cases. Ask any architect what the first name of Gaudi is, and see what sort of response you&#x2019;ll get. &#xA;Another problem is how to deal with misspelling, partial names, and other information. What if we actually have the architect id, and are used to type that? I would much rather type 1831 than Mies Van Der Rohe, and most users that work with the application day in and day out would agree.&#xA;From the system perspective, we want to divide the problem into two separate issues, finding the architect and finding the appropriate designs. From a user experience perspective, that means that the text box is going to be an ajax suggest box, and the results would be loaded based on valid id.&#xA;Using RavenDB and ASP.Net MVC, we would have the following solution. First, we need to define the search index:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This gives us the ability to search across both name and id easily, and it allows us to do full text searches as well. The next step is the actual querying for architect by name:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Looks complex, doesn&#x2019;t it? Well, there is certainly a lot of code there, at least.&#xA;First, we look for an a matching result in the index. If we find anything, we send just the name and the id of the matching documents to the user. that part is perfectly simple.&#xA;The interesting bits happen when we can&#x2019;t find anything at all. In that case, we ask RavenDB to find us results that might be the things that the user is looking for. It does that by running a string distance algorithm over the data in the database already and providing us with a list of suggestions about what the user might have meant.&#xA;We take it one step further. If there is just one suggestion, we assume that this is what the user meant, and just return the results for that value. If there is more than that, we sent an empty result set to the client along with a list of alternatives that they can suggest to the user.&#xA;From here, the actual task of getting the designs for this architect becomes as simple as:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And it turns out that when you think about it right, searching is simple.</p>
