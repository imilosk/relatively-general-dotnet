            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post about NHibernate and Stored Procedures, I showed how it can be done, and I closed of with this:The disadvantages - You take away from NHibernate the ability to comprehend the structure of the tables, this mean that it can&#x27;t do joins, eager fetching, etc. This is extremely important capability that just vanished. Likewise for queries, NHibernate&#x27;s abilities to query your objects is being severly limited using this method of operation.    Galen commented:            It sounds like the following two architectural decisions are mutually exclusive:        1. Require stored procedures for all data access                 2. Use NHibernate                Is there an effective way to do both?                We have a particularly large project (3 year, multi-million) on which we know we need code generation.&#xA0; Our choices are down to                 a) NHibernate/MyGeneration or                 b) Roll our own code generation using CodeSmith templates.&#xA0;                 We want to use NHibernate, but our data architects are unhappy about losing the &quot;require stored procedures&quot; battle.        I won&#x27;t get into the issues I have with &quot;SP for everything&quot;, I already expressed them (at some length), elsewhere.&#xA0; NHibernate is a great tool for abstracting the database, and calling Stored Procedures is a good step forward, mainly because some issues are best solved with them.     The main problem with stored procedures is that they rob NHibernate one of its most important advantages, its flexibility. If you want to do an arbitrary join between three entities and sort by a forth, you can do it very easily. This opens up a lot of options that you just can&#x27;t have with SP. Using SP, if the SP doesn&#x27;t allow it, you just can&#x27;t do it. And any time you have a new need you have to either create a new SP or add parameters, and I am not sure which is worse.    Here is what I would recommend, assuming that the &quot;Give Me Stored Procedures Or Give Away The Database&quot; mindset is prevasive. Do all selects from views (preferably thin views), and all CUD via stored procedures. I had quite a success with using views for NHibernate, and I don&#x27;t really care how NHibernate is writing stuff to the database. That is going to always be fairly simple insert/update/delete statement, and as long as the SP keeps the usual semantics, everything is going to be fine.    In most cases, this makes the DBAs happy, since then they get to deny everyone direct access to the databases, and they control both the views and the SP.&#xA0;However, this also means that NHibernate is mostly free to join between the views, so it doesn&#x27;t lose any of its power.    Take into account that writing the SP and wiring NHibernate to use them is still not simple, but you get all the power of NHibernate and the DBAs are happy because they get to keep all of the control in their hand and can optimize the database to their heart&#x27;s content.    Now, if you can&#x27;t get your data architects to&#xA0;accept that, it is&#xA0;a problem.    Would I use NHibernate is a situation where SP are&#xA0;really the only way to use the database? Yes. But you&#xA0;should read this statement with the qualifier that says &quot;I really like NHibernate and I know what I&#x27;m doing there.&quot; There is a lot of value that NHibernate brings to the table quite outside from&#xA0;the flexiblity of working with the data model (just the Unit Of Work is a huge issue for me, and I could gush on and on and on about it... hm, actually, I do&#xA0;). But, I don&#x27;t have any experiance in working with NHibernate in a SP-only manner. (And if I have any say in the matter, I won&#x27;t :-) ). It might be better to try asking the Java guys that has done it before.    I would highly recommend against rolling your own, for reasons already mentioned.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have a piece of code that has to calculate some pretty hefty stuff over a large amount of data. Unfortantely, that large amount of data took large amount of time to load. By large amount I mean, I walked away and had time for a coffee, chit chat, about three phone calls and a relaxing bout of head banging, and it still continued to pry into the database, and likely would continue to do so until the end of time or there about.    This calculation has two main charactaristics:            It is vital to several core functions of the system.            It is very highly preferred to make this calculation on the fly. Doing it on the backend is possible, but will cause a lot of major complications.    So, in the middle of checking the price of a dozen new servers (and a safe place in Nigeria, once the client hear about this), it occur to me that while pre-mature optimization is evil, maybe optimization itself has some&#xA0;value and that Nigeria might have to wait for another day.    After carefully thinking about the scentific process (i.e: observing the occurances, forming a theory, preparing experiments, proving a theory, arguing for a decade about what it means, etc...) I decided to take a more direct approach and looked at what I was trying to do.    Then I added this to the query:             left     join fetch e.Rules rules        And I re-run the whole thing. The performance benefit was four orders of magnitude. And by that I mean that the page is still very heavy DB wise (around ~50 queries on empty cache, which is my usual benchmark), it actually complete in real time, and all the rest of that stuff are things that are very easy to solve (grab those three pieces of code in one shot, instead of five, etc).    Of course, I then had to spend about half an hour staring at the generated query and think about what it was doing (there was a CROSS JOIN there that scared me) before coming to the conclution that it really was a good&#xA0;to fetch all that data. Well, almost. There should have been around ~6000 rows returned from this query, but only 2 were returned.    After a long bout of head scratching, I determained that the fault was at my mapping. I had several places where I had where clauses like this one:where=&quot;Cancelled&#xA0;=&#xA0;0&quot;    I&#x27;m pretty sure that you can see where this is going. In a left join scenario, this (non-nullable) column is going to be null, so it would evaluate to false, making the join into an inner join, reducing the returned data by quite a bit. I&#x27;m writing this post as I go along fixing this issue. Right now the situation is not much improved :-(    After a long and hard battle, I managed to drop it merely three order of magnitude down, and I run into some issues with the code that uses it, so I need to fix those first.    I&#x27;ll try to post some ideas about how to solve the complex SELECT N&#x2B;(M*N*Zm)&#x2B;1 issues (where N is the number of items, M is the number of collections in each item, and Zm is the number of items in each collection in each item). (The short version, don&#x27;t do this.)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I branched&#xA0;Active Record to move it to NHibernate 1.2, because of some needed features from NHibernate 1.2 that simply do not exist in NHibernate 1.0.2. The branch at the moment should handle generics natively and easily, so you should be able to do this:             [    HasMany]    public ISet&lt;Post&gt; Posts { ... }        And Active Record would figure out all the rest. (Although it is probably recommended to give it at least the table / column for the relation).    But, as much as I like features that include &quot;someone else will figure it out&quot;, the nicest feature of all is this one:            ProjectionQuery&lt;Blog, int&gt; proj = new ProjectionQuery&lt;Blog, int&gt;(Projections.RowCount());                        int rowCount = proj.Execute();                        Assert.AreEqual(1, rowCount);        This one involves taking advantage on NHibernate 1.2 projections, and it makes certain types of action possible, the above query can also take an ICriteria, which make it a very easy way to handle what previously required HQL to do. There are a large number of builtin projections that can be used, and I found uses for them about 5 minutes after seeing them in action.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">No, I&#x27;m not going to talk about the hard to create/understand queries, performance, or maintainability. The really bad side of composite keys is that you get assoications using part of a key. Here is an example:        Now, start working with the associations here. Payments are linked to salaries that falls within their date range and belong to the same employee. Needless to say, this breaks down FK support, so you will end up with bad data that you need to clean. No to mention that they queries that you need against this database are horrendous.    But, the wost thing that I saw was a relation between two tables that relied on the last N left-most unique characters in a string key.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a major WTF, in my opinon, consider the following code:            using&#xA0;System;        public&#xA0;class&#xA0;Program        {        &#xA0;static&#xA0;void&#xA0;Main()        &#xA0;{        &#xA0;&#xA0;Console.WriteLine(&#xA0;&quot;Is&#xA0;Public:&#xA0;{0}&quot;,&#xA0;typeof(Inner).IsPublic&#xA0;);        &#xA0;&#xA0;Console.WriteLine(&#xA0;&quot;Is&#xA0;Not&#xA0;Public:&#xA0;{0}&quot;,&#xA0;typeof(Inner).IsNotPublic&#xA0;);        &#xA0;}        &#xA0;        &#xA0;public&#xA0;class&#xA0;Inner&#xA0;{}        }        Without compiling this, can you hazzard a guess about what is the result of this program?    Don&#x27;t bother, here it is:Is Public: False    Is Not Public: False    In a stunning misuse of their own guidlines and the English langauge, those are actually not mirror images of each other. Furthermore, check out the documentation for those properties:Type.IsPublic and Type.IsNotPublic. Ignore the documentation at the top of the page, it flat out misleading, check the Property Value section, it contains such gems as (IsNotPublic):true if the Type is not declared public and is not a nested type; otherwise, false.    So, I can change the visibility of Inner to private, and the output remains the same. IsXXX is a well defined notation, this just completely breaks it. The issue here is the use of TypeAttributes to get the value, and TypeAttributes make a distiction between Public and NestedPublic, but why the hell do they take this distinction to the IsXXX properties. Either the value is public or it isn&#x27;t, don&#x27;t go put nesting issues there when you call the property IsPublic.</p>
