            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Damn, but that is a good book. A different style than most of the other ones, with a lot more investment in characters than in actions, but very good nonetheless. Highly recommended. Finished it in one sitting, and already want more, but that would be out in 2008 :-(</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just bought Empire of Ivory, in both ebook and audio book format.  It came out four days ago, and I can&#x27;t believe that I let four days pass by without getting that.  Yes, it is that good. &#xA0; I was just getting ready to listen to&#xA0; Black Powder War, the third part of this series, but with changing times comes changing plans. Now I intend to read the ebook, hopefully this will take up the rest of the night only, and then listen to Black Powder War and then to Empire of Ivory as an audio book. I don&#x27;t have Throne of Jade as an audio book, the story was masterfully told, but I didn&#x27;t like all the PITA politics that went there, too realistic and far too close to stuff that I had to deal with in the past, so I am skipping that. I really enjoyed His Majesty Dragon as both an ebook and an audio book, however. I usually don&#x27;t re-read books at those intervals, but Naomi is a very talented writer. And I am looking forward to that. &#xA0; Right now I have finished listening to We Few from David Weber again (started on the flight, actually), and I am really wishing that this story had more books in it, there are at least two that I can think of. &#xA0; Now I just need to get through some Brail bugs before I can dedicate myself to truly masterful story telling...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Manuel Abadia&#xA0;has some criticism on NHibernate that I wanted to respond to. First things first, though, it seems that I have been hasty in my response to a problem that Manuel reported, NH-1123. I really don&#x27;t like it when other people do it to me, and I would like to apologize to Manuel for treating him in a manner I don&#x27;t wish to be treated. &#xA0;As an aside, I have created a new bug&#xA0;on&#xA0;the JIRA,&#xA0;with&#xA0;a bit more focus on the underlying problem. This bug has now been fixed, and I would like to thank Manuel for (a) finding it, (b) persisting even after I wasn&#x27;t as attentive as I should. Interesting bug, by the way. He had several other things to say, which I want to respond to in details:  1)&#xA0;It is heavily tied to the java version (Hiberante), so a lot of the request and/or enhancements are ignored. If the java version is not going to add it, probably it will not be added to NHibernate. &#xA0;I wouldn&#x27;t say that, NHibernate is focused on bringing us up to par with Hibernate, but that is certainly not saying that we aren&#x27;t going to add things that Hibernate doesn&#x27;t have. Right now, MultiQuery and MultiCriteria are stuff that Hibernate doesn&#x27;t have and we do, and there are others. At the same time, if a feature request is something that we can either develop from scratch or port from Hibernate, we would rather bring it from Hibernate. The main reasons are to make it easier to use documentation, built on already fixed bugs, maintain knowledge, and more.  2)&#xA0;Hibernate was started in 2001, and was designed to overcome a lot of the ORM problems. During these years, it has solved a lot of those problems, but other still remain and they can&#x2019;t be fixed without heavily changing its design. There are certainly things that I would change with NHibernate/Hibernate if I were able. One of the things on the very top of the list would be to turn the entire internals to AST manipulation and delay the actual generation of SQL to just before executing the query / command. We are working on that, actually. And you are more than welcome to join in and help us do so. And yes, I do mean you, personally, dear reader. I would be interested to learn what the other problems are, by the way.  3)&#xA0;Even if it is extensible, the IInterceptor interface does not expose all the events that can be interesting to capture (For example, events after loading, updating or deleting data). The only way to handle that at the moment is to implement the ILifecycle interface by the entity itself, losing entity transparency. Fabio Maulo has been doing tremendous amount of work on this very topic, and NHibernate 2.0 will have the full power of events and listeners from Hibernate 3.0. Most of the world have been completed, and can be found on NHibernate trunk, it opens quite a bit of possibilities.  4)&#xA0;No paging support in some nontrivial scenarios. As I said, the bug was fixed, but even without that, I would still say that this is not correct. There are quite a few ways that you can do paging in NHibernate, the default approach is not always the best one.  5)&#xA0;There is no support for retrieving all the data at once for hierarchical queries Here is one example of how to do just that :-) Okay, that was cheating, since it used native SQL, but that did worked through NHibernate, and you got live entities back from it. No, NHibernate has not native support for doing hierarchical queries, and to support them we have the prerequisite of AST based internal, most probably. (At least the way I think about them) There is also multi queries, which is what I use to do hierarchies all over the place, mainly because they are far cheaper than a single hierarchical query in real world scenarios (7 tables representing hierarchy, in my case). To surmise, I would like to mention that NHibernate is an open source project. By its very nature, you are able to go into the code and fix things yourself! NHibernate&#x27;s codebase is fairly big, but it is also well partitioned, so you are going to find it much easier to work with it than you would expect by simple size estimates. If you have a problem, by all means, please report it, but do give a try at fixing it, that is going to be easier than you imagine.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Usually when I start a system, I want to focus on the shortest scenario that would bring me a live system. That is usually the login page, since that is almost universally identical.  My approach to that is fairly simple, Login Controller that collaborate with an authentication service and an authorization service. The first to verify who the user is, the second to verify that the user even has the right to log in. I always use interfaces for those, so I would have IAuthorizationService and IAuthenticationService as the forth or fifth elements in my application.  Now, the reason for interfaces is actually not mocking, or anything of the like. If is simply because an interface allows me to create a strict separation between what is going on and how&#xA0;it works. In order to complete the story, I may often need to write ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationService, but that is an implementation detail, I don&#x27;t want to know about that. I want the interface to express just the required detailed for authentication, not to be involved with the details of actually handling the AD authentication. In most projects I am going to have only one implementation of many of those types of interfaces, but the fact that I maintain this separation means that reading the code that makes use of those interfaces is far easier than it would have been otherwise. There is a wider line between the two collaborators, and far less chance of letting implementation semantics go through. I was in place to try to extract those semantics out once or twice, and that is never pleasant or easy.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Wendy has a very good point here. Good practices, good design, are not there in order to facilitate some fad-of-the-day. The case she is giving is DI, SRP and SoC with regards to testing, and then taking the nuclear approach to testing, and deciding that since you can do just fake on the fly anything you need, you&#xA0; can test without DI, SRP and SoC, therefor, you don&#x27;t need them any more. That is a problem. Consider for a moment the guide lines for writing good C programs. Short methods, clear naming, guard clauses, etc. Those still holds today. In fact, pretty much all of the good design rules are not tied down to a technology or a language, and I have very rarely seen a case where it was beneficial to ignore design guidelines. I am extremely suspicious of anything that asserts that &quot;because you are using XYZ, then the following guidelines no longer applies.&quot; Dependency Injection is a good tool, which I can live without if other methods are provided, but ignoring basic guide lines such as the Single Responsibility Principal or Separation of Concerns is going to bite you in the end, each and every time.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Something really bothered me in JAOO. A couple of the presenters had a slide that showed something like this:  The Relational / OO Divide  DBA not familiar with OO design  Developer not familiar with SQL I asked around, and apparently there is this assumption on the Java world that developers are usually only vaguely familiar with SQL. I am not sure if this is the case in practice or not, but that just sounds insane to me. I live in the .NET world, and here I expect&#xA0;all developers to have a fairly good grasp of SQL and&#xA0;how it works. Not to the DBA level, I wouldn&#x27;t really&#xA0;expect a developer to be able to fully analyze a query&#xA0;or optimize it based on index scan patterns for Oracle&#xA0;11.g with patch XYZ.B, but I would expect that they would know SQL as well as they&#xA0;know their&#xA0;programming language of choice. In fact,&#xA0;thinking about it,&#xA0;in most of my recent projects, a developer is expected to know at least the following languages:      C#  XML  XPath  HTML  JavaScript  CSS   ASPX  XSLT  SQL  HQL  Regular Expressions  VB.NET  &#xA0; This isn&#x27;t really from choice, this is simply because those are the stuff that we use fairly often. It seems odd to assume that you would limit that. That would severely limit your ability to actually do useful work.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here is an observation, once a code base has reached a certain size, either in time or in size, it usually takes on a style and identity of its own. This is far more than just a coding style that I am talking about. I don&#x27;t care where you put the braces. I am talking about the repeated patterns that you see over and over in side that code base. An example would be Castle-inspired projects. You are far more likely to see things named SmartXYZ or IAbcAware, with the usual implications that there are there. What are the styles that you have noticed?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, I am finally home. After running into three late consecutive flights, slow bus, late train and one sweat car ride home. All in all, it was about 20 hours on the road (from the moment I left the hotel to the moment I reached home). I am suddenly reminded of all the reasons why I don&#x27;t really like to travel. Couldn&#x27;t sleep the whole trip, so I am acting very funny now, got a whole torrent of stuff out in one go when I got home, got pretty funny responses, as well. I am going to crash soon...</p>
