            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The design of Macto (that is this prison management application I&#x2019;m discussing) so far seems pretty strange. Some of the constraints are common, the desire for resiliency and being able to have each independent portion of the system work in isolation. However, the way we go about handling this is strange.I looked up the definition of a micro services architecture and I got to Martin Fowler, saying:..the microservice architectural style [1] is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.This wouldn&#x2019;t work for our prison system, because we are required to continue normal operations when we can&#x2019;t communicate with the other parts of the system. A prison block may not be able to talk to the Registration Office, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that it can error. Operations must continue normally.So RPC over HTTPS is out, but what about messaging? We can use a queue to dispatch commands / events to the other parties in the system, no? The answer is that we can do that, but let&#x2019;s consider how that will work. For events, that would work quite nicely, and have roughly the same model that we have now. In fact, with the RavenDB ETL process and the dissemination protocol in place, that is pretty much what we have. Changes to my local state are pushed via ETL to a shared known location and then distributed to the rest of the system.But what about commands? A command in the system can be things like &#x201C;we got a warrant for releasing an inmate&#x201D;. That is something that must proceed successfully. If there is a communication breakdown, generating an error message is not acceptable, in this case, someone will hand deliver the warrant to the block and get this inmate out of the prison. In other words, we have the notion of commands flowing in the system, but the same command can also come from the Registration Office or from a phone call or from a lawyer physically showing up at the block and shoving a bunch of papers at the sergeant on duty demanding an immediate release. All of this leads me to create an data architecture that is based on local data interaction with a backbone to share it, while relying on external channels to route around issues between parts of the system. Let&#x2019;s consider the case of a releasing an inmate. The normal way it works is that the Registration Office prepare a list of inmates that needs to be released today. Here is one such document, which is created on the Registration Office server.This then flow via ETL to the rest of the prison. Each block will get the list of inmates that they need to process for release and the Command &amp; Control Center is in charge that they are processed and released properly. I&#x2019;ll have a separate post to talk about such workflows, because they are interesting, but the key here is that we don&#x2019;t actually have a command being sent.Instead, we create a document starting the workflow for release. This is exactly the same as an event being published and it will be received by the other parties in the prison. At this point, each party is going to do their own thing. For example, the Command &amp; Control Center will verify that the bus to the nearest town is ordered and each block&#x2019;s sergeant is in charge of getting the inmates processed out of the block and into the hand of the Registration Office, which will handle things such as returning personal effects, second verification that the right inmate is released, etc.Unlike a command, which typically have a success / error code, we use this notion as well as timed alerts to verify that things happen. In other words, the Command &amp; Control Center will be alerted if the inmate isn&#x2019;t out of the prison by 10:00 AM and will take steps to check why that has happened. The Registration Office will also do its own checks at the close of the day, to ensure that no inmates are still in the prison when they shouldn&#x2019;t. Note that this involves multiple parties cooperating with each other, but none of them explicitly rely on request / response style of communication. This is message passing, and also event publication, but I find that this is a much more passive manner in which you&#x2019;ll work. Instead of explicitly interacting with the outside world, you are always operating on your own data, and additional work and tasks to do shows up as it is replicated from the other parts of the system.Another benefit of this approach is that it also ensures that there are multiple and independent verification steps for most processes, which is a good way to avoid making mistakes with people&#x2019;s freedom.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the previous post, I talked about the flow of data in the system and introduced the notion of sharing data via explicit ETL processes. The ETL process is an explicit contract of each part of the system that shares some of the data to the outside world. By the way, in the context of the prison system, the outside world is a bit misleading, it might be more accurate to say that we share the data with the other parties inside the prison. Nothing here is actually available outside the prison itself (integration with other systems, such as the Department of Justice, other prisons, etc is an even more complex topic that I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;ll be covering. For now, assume that the method of integration if a Fax machine). Here is the simplest topology that we can build using this approach. The Registration Office has an ETL process that outputs the data it wants to share with a dedicated database, specially for this purpose. From this public database, we setup replication to dedicated database instances on each of the blocks. In other words, when the application inside the block wants to access some shared data, it isn&#x2019;t going to reach over the network and hit the public registration database but use a local instance that the public registration database is replicating to. Why do we have this behavior? Because we don&#x2019;t trust the network and must always rely on our own local resources. When the network is available, we&#x2019;ll get continuous updates via replication, and when it isn&#x2019;t available, we&#x2019;ll have the latest information that we possibly could and can still act on that (I&#x2019;ll have a separate post talking about workflow processes that mitigate eventual consistency and concurrency handling in such a system).This means that the application can always continue running, regardless of the state of the outside world.Another option, which is somewhat simpler, is to not have a public registration database, but a database that is there to share the data explicitly between all the different parties, this will look like this:In this case, each party&#x2019;s setup includes both the internal data that is required to running the block / office / department in question and a shared database that is used to hold all the data that is shared by all the parties in the prison.Note that the topology of the shared data is a full mesh. In other words, data that is sent to the shared database from the Registration Office using RavenDB ETL will be sent to all the other parties, this is the same as we had before. However, because we now have a shared database, if the Registration Office cannot talk to Block B, that block will still get all the updates from Block A, including the updates that originated from the Registration Office. This is because RavenDB replication uses the gossip model and can bridge such gaps in network without issue.This might be a simpler model, because the process of each party publishing information for the consumption of the rest of the prison is simplified, we simply define an ETL process to the shared database and the data will be distributed far and wide, made available to anyone that wants it.This has the advantage that most of the details of managing services can be deferred to RavenDB. You need to make sure that your ETL processes are contractual, that is, they don&#x2019;t change the shape or meaning of the data, and that is about it. All data access from the application is made to the local database and there is little need to worry about integration between the various parties, error handling of remote calls, etc.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In our prison system, we have a lot of independent parts, by design. Each of them is expected to work independently of the rest of the system, but also cooperate with them. That typically require a particular mindset when designing the application.Let&#x2019;s lay out the different aspects of integration between the various pieces, shall we?Each part of the system should be able to run completely independently from the other pieces.There are offline methods for communications (literally a guy walking down to the block with a piece of paper) that can be a backup communication plane but can also by pass the system entirely (a warrant being served directly to the block&#x2019;s officers). There are two distinct options for communication: Commands (release this inmate, ensure inmate is ready to go to court at date) and notifications (inmates count, status, etc)We trust, but verify, each piece of information that we receive.The first point seems like a pretty standard requirement, but in combination of the second point, we get into a particularly interesting issue. We may have the same information entered into the system by multiple parties at different times.For example, a warrant to release an inmate might be served directly to the block&#x2019;s officer. The release is processed, and then the warrant arrives to the Registration office, which will also enter it. At some later time, this data is merged and we need to ensure that it make sense to the people reading it.The offline communication plane is also a very important design considerations for a system that reflects the real world. It means that we don&#x2019;t have to provide too complex an infrastructure for surviving production. In fact, given the fact that a prison is going to hardly have a top notch technical operations team (they might have a top notch operations team, but they refer to something quite different), we don&#x2019;t want to build something that rely on good communications.To make sense of such a system, we need to define data ownership and data flow between the various systems. Because this is a really complex system, we&#x2019;ll take a few example and analyze them properly. The legal status of an inmate.The location of an inmate.What is the meaning of legal status? It means under what warrant it is in the prison (held until trial, 48 hours hold, got a final judgement). At its simplest, it is what date should this person be released. But in practical terms, this can be much more complex and may have conditions on where this inmate can be held, what they can do, etc. Everything about the legal status of an inmate is the responsibility of the Registration Office. Any movements of inmates into or out of the prison must go through the Registration Office. Actually, this isn&#x2019;t quite true. Any movement of an inmate from the responsibility of the prison must go through the Registration Office. But the physical location of the inmate is the responsibility of the block into which the inmate was assigned.A good example of this would be an inmate that has been hospitalized. They are not physically inside the prison, but the prison is still responsible for them. The Registration Office doesn&#x2019;t usually care for such details (but sometimes they do, for example, if the inmate has a court date that they&#x2019;ll miss, they need to notify the court) because there isn&#x2019;t a change in who is in charge of the inmate. This is complex, but this is also the real world, and we need to manage this complexity. So, let&#x2019;s define the ownership rules and data flow behavior:Legal Status is owned by Registration Office and is being disseminated from there to all interested parties.The location of an inmate and its current physical status are owned by the blocked it is assigned to and disseminated from there to all interested parties.The assignment of an inmate to a particular block is also interesting. This piece of information is owned by the Registration Office, but it is not their (sole) decision. This may take a bit of explaining. The block an inmate is assigned to is determined by a bunch of stuff. What is the legal status of the inmate, what is the previous / expected behavior of this inmate, whatever the inmate needs to be isolated from / together with certain people, information / recommendation from the intelligence office, court decisions, the free space available on each block, the inmate medical status and many other details that are not quite important. The Registration Office will usually make the initial placement of where an inmate is going to go, but this is not their decision, there is a workflow involved that has input from way too many parties. The official decision is at the hands of the prison commander, but recording this decision (and the data ownership of it) is at the hands of the Registration Office.Okay, enough domain knowledge, let&#x2019;s talk about the technical details, shall we? I&#x2019;m sorry that I have to do such an info dump, and I&#x2019;m trying to contain it to relevant pieces, but if I don&#x2019;t include the semantics of what we are doing, it will make very little sense or be extremely artificial.The legal status of inmates in the Registration Office needs to be sent to other parties in the prison. In particular, all the blocks and the Command &amp; Control Center. We can deal with this by defining the following RavenDB ETL process from the Registration Office:What this does is simply define the data that we&#x2019;ll share to the outside world. If I was building this for real, this will probably be a lot bigger, because an inmate is a really complex topic. What is important here is that we define this as an explicit process. In other words, this is part of the service contract that we have with the outside world. The shape of the data and the way we publish it may only be changed if we contact all parties involved. Practically speaking, this usually means that we can only add data, but never remove any fields from the system.Note that in this case, we simplify the model as we send it out. The warrants for this inmate aren&#x2019;t going out, and we just pull the latest status and release dates from the most up to date warrant. This is a good example of how we avoid exposing our internal state to the outside world, giving us the flexibility to change things later.The question now is where does this data goes to? RavenDB ETL will write the data to an external database, and here we have a few options. First, we can define an ETL target for each of the known parties that want this data (each of the blocks and the Command &amp; Control Center, at this time). But while that would work, it isn&#x2019;t such a great idea. We&#x2019;ll have to duplicate the ETL definition for each of those.A better option is to send the (transformed) data to a dedicated database that will be our integration source. Consider the following example:In this case, we can have this dedicated public database that exposes all the data that the Registration Office shares with the rest of the world. Any part that wants this information can setup external replication from this database to their own. In this manner, when the Intelligence Office decides to make it known that they also needs to access the inmate registration data, we can just add them as a replication destination for this database.Another option is not to have each individual party in the prison share its own status, but have a single shared database that each of them write to. This can look like this:In this case, any party that wants to share data will be writing it to the shared database, and anyone who reads it will have access to it through replication from there. This way, we define a data pipeline of all the shared data in the prison that anyone can hook up to.This post is getting long enough that I&#x2019;ll separate the discussion of the actual topology of the data and handling the incoming data to separate posts, stay tuned.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When you need to write a form, one of the first things that pops to mind is what kind of validations are required. A good example would be the new user registration form:This is such an ingrained instinct that we typically seek to stop such invalid states as soon as possible. If the business rules says that you cannot have a certain state, it is easiest to just ensure that you can never get into such a state.If you are working in a system that exists purely within the scope of your application, that might actually be useful property to have. This is certainly something that you want in your code, because it means that you can make assumptions on invariants. If you have a system that reflects the real world, however, you need to take into account several really annoying things:Your model of the real world is not accurate, and will never be accurate.The real world changes, sometimes quite rapidly and in a very annoying fashion.Sometimes the invariant is real, but you gotta violate it anyway.If the system doesn&#x2019;t let the users do their job, they will do the job in spite of your system. That will lead to a system of workarounds. Eventually, you&#x2019;ll have to support these workarounds. This may result in hair loss and significant amount of aggravation.Consider the case that the prison in question is a minimum security prison, expected to have white collar inmates that have already been tried. Now you get an inmate that is accused of murder and is currently on trial. (Side note, prisons have a very different structure for people who still undergoing trial, because they aren&#x2019;t convicted yet and because the amount of pressure that they are under is very high. They&#x2019;ll typically be held in different facilities and treated differently from inmates that have already been convicted and tried).What do you think will happen if the system refuses to accept such an inmate into the prison? Well, the guy is right there, and the prison commander has already authorized letting him in. So telling him that he should go back home because they &#x201C;computer won&#x2019;t let you in&#x201D; is not going to be a workable solution. Instead, we use a very different model for validation and acceptance of data. Instead of stopping the bad input as soon as possible, we raise a flag about it during processing, but we do allow the user to proceed, assuming they explicitly authorize this. It will look like this:At the same time, we flag such records and require additional review of the data.In most cases, by the way, the fact that the inmate is in residence is not something that can be ignored and will be in all reports on the state of the prison until the state changes (transferred, verdict given, etc).This kind of thinking is important, because it means that the software intrinsically does not trust the data, but continue runs validation on it. This is a good practice to be in when dealing with systems that reflect the real world.This does lead to an interesting question, where do we run these validations, and when?The ground rules for a good application is that it is like an amoeba, it may have multiple locations that it accepts input, but that is the only way to push data in, through well defined channels.This is another way of saying that we don&#x2019;t allow someone else to go and poke around in our database behind our back.Any time that we accept new data, regardless of the channel it arrives in, we run it through the validation pipeline. And this validation pipeline can add (or mark as obsolete) validation issues that should be brought to the attention of the people in charge.Note that these sort of validations are almost always very much business rules, not type issues. If someone&#x2019;s birthday is in the future, you can feel free to very easily reject that data as purely invalid. But if someone&#x2019;s release date is in the past, however, you might still need to accept them as an inmate (the paperwork are really in the mail, sometimes). I think I&#x2019;ll need another post just to talk about how to implement these validation rules and behaviors, but that is still down the line. The next post topic is going to be data flow between the different systems that we talked about so far.</p>
