            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So for the last few hours I have been getting back into the Linq for NHibernate project, after having left it for far too long. I am beginning to think that building a Linq provider might not have been the best way to learn C# 3.0, but never mind that now. It is with great pride that I can tell you that the following query now works: from e in db.Employeesselect new { Name = e.FirstName &#x2B; &quot; &quot; &#x2B; e.LastName, Phone = e.HomePhone } Why is this trivial query important? Well, it is important because about a year ago I said that there is only a single feature in Linq for SQL that NHibernate doesn&#x27;t have. I also promised to fix it the moment that someone would tell me what it is. No one did, so it waited until today. The main issue had to do with the Criteria API and handling parameters, no one ever needed to do that, it seems. When they did, they generally used HQL, which did have this feature. Since I have based Linq for NHibernate on the Criteria API*, that was a problem. Now that ReSharper works on C# 3.0, I can actually get things done there, so I sat down and implemented it. It is surprisingly difficult issue, but I threw enough code on it until it gave up (I wonder if there is a name for nested visitors... ). At any rate, I strongly recommend that you&#x27;ll take a look at the project. And bug (fixes) and other patches are welcome**. * This decision was important for two reasons, the first was that it is generally easier to use the Criteria API programmatically, and the second was that I wanted to ensure that the Crtieria API (which I favor) was a full featured as the HQL route. ** Yes, I know that I&#x27;ll regret it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Amazon has released (scroll all the way down) some details about their outage. It is light on details, but it gives enough information to guess a few things. Apparently, there is an authentication services that handles both account validation and authentication of request. Since authenticated requests requires some cryptography, they are significantly more expensive than unauthenticated requests. Since the authentication services also handle account validation, and since that is done per request, swamping the authentication services with costly authenticated request has overloaded the capacity of the authentication services and cause many account validation requests to fail. As I was reading Amazon&#x27;s response, I kept thinking about Release It! It seems like Amazon&#x27;s issue could be a great sample for that book. I am not sure what could be done to prevent this rolling outage scenario (except adding more capacity, of course). Maybe prioritizations of requests, or determining that the authentication service is effectively down, triggering a Circuit Breaker and ignoring account validation for a specified amount of time? That would give some people the option to use the service even if they didn&#x27;t pay for the account, I would guess, but that would be much better for Amazon than the effect of the outage. It is an interesting thought experiment. What would you do in this scenario?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, this is just a train of thought about a few things. I just finished submitting a couple of chapters, and I feel very wrung out at the moment. For the last few weeks I have been too busy to do much of the things that I usually do. First there was getting ready to quit my job, with a last minute project to finish. That took most of my time in that regard, and I let the book project slid too far behind schedule.  This week I spent most of my time writing, and it was bloody well hard. The chapter about integrating DSL into your application progressed agonizingly slowly. I couldn&#x27;t really keep writing for extended period of time, which was damn annoying, since I already had a fairly good idea what I wanted to write. The next chapter was far easier to write, but still took too long, in my opinion. One of the results of that was that I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to email, currently I have 64(!!!) unread emails, and about a dozen tasks that I need to handle relating to my OSS projects. I thought leaving work was supposed to give me more free time... :-) I am going to get some rest and try to handle that afterward. Other tidbits include the fact that ReSharper 4.0 is now in early access program, with features that really make me want to drool. This means that I can work with VS 2008 now (well, hopefully). This has direct correlation to the amount of work that is now going to head into Linq for NHibernate. Udi Dahan has a very interesting post about moving from CRUD to Domain Driven services. It is an eye opener, and I heartily recommend reading it. Amazon&#x27;s S3 have suffered a massive failure, apparently. Some of the comments on that are interesting, looks like it is suggested as high volume, good performance but with possible high latencies. As such, you probably should use it for archiving and storage, but still keep a hot cache around on your own servers so you can get at least partial service when it is down. Enough for now, I think...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just did a major refactoring to Rhino DSL, to add orthongality to the DslEngine. It was an interesting refactoring, and something that is worth talking about. Let us take a look at the before image, first:   We have two classes that are involved in creating and managing DSL. Notice the FileFormat, CreateInput, GetMatchingUrlsIn and NotifyOnChange methods on the DslEngine? Or the GetFromCache, RemoveFromCache, SetInCache methods? The firsts are related to the storage of the DSL scripts on disk and the second batch are related to caching, they have nothing to do with the actual work performed by the DslEngine. Those are completely different responsibilities and concerns. I didn&#x27;t feel the pain of mixing the responsibilities until I had to create a class that wanted to change the storage mechanism of the scripts.&#xA0; Looking at it, the cache methods especially really want to move to another class. You can tell by their names. Then I realized that I had to override a bunch of methods and correlate results between them, and I found myself thinking, &quot;Who the hell wrote this nightmare?&quot; *. Changing the storage mechanism, something that I certainly wanted to support, has gotten fairly involved, and I couldn&#x27;t see anyone figuring out all the knobs they had to turn without reading the source, carefully. This is a bad situation to be in. Hence, refactoring. What was involved in this was mostly moving code around. The technicalities of it where mostly these:  Ask R# to extract super class with the unrelated methods. Ask R# to extract an interface from the new super class Remove the inheritance association with the DslEngine Add a property for the new interface type Initialize the property to use a default implementation Fix code that broke as a result (mostly involved adding the property name before the method). Rename methods to match current location (Removing the &quot;Cache&quot; from the methods in the caching interface). The result is this:  Now, changing the storage mechanism doesn&#x27;t need to affect the DSL implementation. We have a more robust model, and a good example for the blog. Of course, I just finished writing half a chapter about the old way of doing things... Time for a rewrite.  * I often think thoughts like this, the sad answer is often: &quot;Me&quot;.</p>

I really like what Microsoft did here. Both in terms of the UI experience that you get, the guidance that they keep popping up (which is not annoying), the speed, and overall feeling. What really made me happy was this. Now I can actually drill down and see what is going on so easily.   Something that certainly cheered me up was the file-copy test:   It started instantly, and it looks like we get information that is actually useful. Unlike... that other OS.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just installed Windows 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 on a VM. Here is the result:   I am not sure what is in there, but it is a lot. I then tried to install SQL Server 2005, but is never let me actually install the server, it only want to install the client components. It warns that you need SP2, so I installed that, then try it again, no go. Any ideas?   By the way, so far, ignoring the issue of the SQL Server installation issues, I am impressed by Win 2008, it looks slick, it is fast even on a slow VM. And it is not annoying me. Update: I think that I am stupid. Looks like I installed the web edition of 2008, which I guess can&#x27;t handle SQL Server. I&#x27;m downloading the standard version now, will see how it works.</p>
