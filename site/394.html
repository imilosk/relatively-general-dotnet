            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I wish that I could have more control over virtual memory. In particular, what I would really like at this time is the ability to map two virtual address ranges to the same physical memory. And yes, I am well aware (and already using) the ability to do just that using memory mapped files.&#xA0; However, what I would like to do is to have a pure memory based system, without any files being involved. This is meant to be used for the memory only system, which is commonly meant to be be used for unit testing. The reason that I want to be able to map the physical memory multiple times is that I have a buffer. Let us say that it is 1MB in size. And now I need to grow it. I can&#x2019;t ask the OS to just grow the buffer, since it might not have the virtual address available past the buffer end by the time I request it. What I would like to do is to request a new virtual allocation, let us say of 2 MB, and then ask the OS to map the same physical memory for the first buffer to the first section of the new buffer, and new memory for the rest.  The end result is that the first part of the buffer is mapped twice, and any changes you make there will be visible in both locations. Now, it is pretty easy to do this with memory mapped files, but I couldn&#x2019;t find a way to do it sans files. What I ended up doing is reserve a large portion of the virtual address space (using VirtualAlloc) and then committing it on demand. But I would really have liked to do something better, because now just moved the problem to when I run out of the reserved buffered space.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last time we talked about collections, I talked about Linked Dictionary and Safe List. The first did some fancy dancing to reduce the cost of allocations, and the second would re-create the list on change. Those implementations were good enough for us to go to hundreds of thousands of writes per second in the sequential scenario, but we noticed them cracking up under the pressure for the random writes scenario. So I started looking at more options. As it turns out, there is a very simple immutable and highly efficient design for a list. Just hold to the end of the list, and every append is just creating a new node that points to the old tail of the list. This makes adding to the list an O(1) operation. It is very fast, simple and easy to work with. This has just one issue, it allows efficient iteration only in reverse order. And there are a few places where we are actually relying on the ordering, so it would be nice not to lose that. Alex suggested using a internally mutable but externally immutable structure, such as this one. The benefit here is that we still get external immutability, but we get the performance of mutable access.  That works, as long as we use a list, which we needed for some pretty important things. However, the key collection, and the one that caused us most performance issues was the cost of getting values from the page table, which is a dictionary. We needed a really good solution there. I started to think that we would need to change all the code that uses this, but then I realized something very important. I don&#x2019;t actually need this. I don&#x2019;t need immutability, I just need snapshotting. And another aspect of that is that we have only a single writer thread for all of those items. So while we require that once we gave an instance to a reader, it can never change, that only applies to its externally observable behavior.  I would like to thank Tyler for the suggestion. Basically, we start off with a Concurrent Dictionary (and the only reason we need it is so we can write to the dictionary while we are reading from it, something that isn&#x2019;t safe to do with standard dictionary). The values in that dictionary is an immutable list of the values with the transaction id. Whenever we modify a value, we can drop all the values older than the oldest existing transaction. And when we search, we search for a value that is not greater than our own transaction id. That means that we effectively have a frozen snapshot of the page table, at a very little cost. I felt bad calling this as a generic collection name, so we actually named the class PageTable, since it has a very specific role in the code.  After this was done, we could not longer find any major cost associated with collections. So it is onward to the next challenge, reducing the cost of key comparisons&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Take a look at the following profilers results. They both showcase pretty much the same codebase, without any major changes in between. However, they have been both run on different machines, and they result in very different performance optimization paths.  Main machine:   Laptop:   As you can see, when running the code on my main machine, the most expensive thing is actually writing to disk (WriteToJournal). However, on my laptop, writing to disk is actually very cheap.&#xA0; The likely reason is, again, my laptop is faking writing to disk in favor of buffering writes, even though we explicitly tell it not to. That means that it behaves as if it is we already optimized writing to disk. My main machine behaves more like a server, and we see a lot more I/O costs, which pretty much mask any other costs that we might have. Using the profiler to guide you with regards to how to optimize the system on any one of those machines would lead you in very different paths. With Voron, we are testing it in a variety of scenarios, to make sure that we aren&#x2019;t optimizing for one particular machine and hurting another.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, we found out that the major cost of random writes in our tests was actually writing to disk. Writing 500K sequential items resulted in about 300 MB being written. Writing 500K  random items resulted in over 2.3 GB being written.  Note: I would like to point out Alex&#x2019;s comment, which helped setup this post. So the obvious thing to do would be to use compression. I decided to try and see what that would give us, and the easiest thing to do is to just enable file compression at the NTFS level. But we can probably do better. The major cost we have is writes to the journal file. And we only ever read from the journal file when we recover the database. We are also usually writing multiple pages at a time for most transactions, and for the scenario we care about, writing 100 random values in a single transaction, we are usually write about a 100 pages or so anyway. That means that we have got a pretty big buffer that we can try to compress all at once. Sadly, we don&#x2019;t really see a meaningful improvement under that scenario. Using NTFS compression slow us down considerably, while both LZ4 and Snappy resulted in greatly reduce file writes, but roughly the same performance. &#xA0;   Note that I have done just the minimal amount of work required to test this out. I changed how we are writing to the journal, and disabled reading from it. That was pretty disappointing, to tell you the truth, I fully expected that we&#x2019;ll see some interesting improvements there. The LZ4 compression factor is about x10 for our data set. That means that 100 &#x2013; 121 pages usually are compressed to 10 &#x2013; 13 pages. The good thing about this is that running this through the profiler shows that we are running on a high I/O machine, where the amount and speed of I/O doesn&#x2019;t impact our performance much.  To test it out, I run the same test on an Amazon m3.2xlarge machine, and got the following results (writing to the C: drive):  So for now I think that I&#x2019;ll do the following. We&#x2019;ll focus on the other costs beyond I/O, and profile heavily on systems with higher I/O costs. Compression should work, in fact, my first thought was that we pay for less I/O with more CPU, but that is a guess without looking at the numbers. Here is the cost of committing using compression (lz4):  And here it is without compression:  So the good news is that we can visible see that we reduced the I/O cost from 8 seconds to 3.8 seconds. And even with compression cost of 2.6 seconds, we are still ahead. However, the cost of the collections used is actually a lot worse from our perspective. So we are back to reducing computation costs first, then looking at compression again at a later point in time.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A while ago we added monitoring capabilities to RavenDB via performance counters. The intent was to give our users the ability to easily see exactly what is going on with RavenDB. The actual usage, however, was a lot more problematic.   Performance counters API can just hang, effectively killing us (since we try to initialize it as part of setup db routine). They require specific system permissions, and can fail without them. They get corrupted, for mysterious reasons, and then you need to reset them all. Even after you created them, they can still die on you for no apparent reason. I would have been willing to assume that we are doing something really stupid. Except that SignalR had similar issues. What is worse, it appears that using the performance counters needs to iterate the list of printers on the machine.&#xA0; This is really ridiculous. And it is to the point in which I am willing to just give it up entirely, if only I had something that I could use to replace it with. Currently I threw a lot of try /catch and a background thread to hide that, but it is ugly and brittle.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After pretty much getting to where we wanted with sequential writes, it is time to try to tackle the cost of random writes. Here is Esent &amp; Voron doing random writes for 1 million entries:  Yes, it is sad that this is the case, because we can do about 40 times better for sequential writes. However&#x2026; what is the reason for the slowness? As usual, the answer is to profile, profile &amp; profile. In fact, we want to do profiling on multiple machines, to check that we don&#x2019;t have a machine bias. At any rate, as you can see, we are actually pretty close to Esent in random writes, but why are we so much slower than our performance during sequential writes? Well, we actually covered that, actually. The major reason for the cost is actually the fact that we have to deal with very different B-Tree shapes. You can see the difference between sequential and randomly inserted trees here. The more random you are, the bigger your tree is, the more pages you have to touch whenever you update. Our scenario calls for making 100 random modification in every transaction. That means that on every transaction, we have to touch many different parts of the tree. Here are the results (in pages) for how much it cost us (in this test, we run 5,000 transactions of 100 items each.    &#xA0;  Sequential  Random   Average  7.06   111.37    Max  11.00   134.00    Total  35,320.00   556,973.00    Std Dev  0.35   7.09  In other words, this means that on average, a sequential transaction wrote 7 pages, or about 28Kb. While the average random transaction wrote about 450Kb! While the total size written for sequential was 137MB, and allocate 319MB. However, random sizes wrote 2.1 GB for 2.3 GB that were allocated. And that explains quite a lot about the whole thing. (Note that we count for writes only the journal writes, not the data writes, because those are the limiting factor for write performance).  Esent, by the way, writes sequentially about 465 MB and 2.3GB for random writes. Now we know why we are pretty close, because the vast majority of the time is actually spent just writing to the disk, and we are stalled by the sheer amount of data we have.  Interestingly enough, I don&#x2019;t think that there is a good way to handle that nicely. Certainly not with a B-Tree. We&#x2019;ll see how we can work with that at a future post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The following code is taken from the leveldb codebase:  This code is responsible for merging concurrent transactions. It operates using a mutex and conditional variables. And the idea really impressed me when I first saw it. I implemented that in Voron because I think that this is a great way to gain higher concurrency rates while still having a single writer mode (which is much easier to work with). However, as it turned out, this isn&#x2019;t a really good idea in practice. The way conditional variables work, you lock the mutex, check your condition, and then wait on the conditional variable. Waking up from a conditional variable means that you have re-acquired the mutex. What I want to happen:  Multiple concurrent threads will try to write at the same time. One of them goes through and start writing, it takes all the pending writes and write them to disk. It then releases all the waiting threads whose work it already completed. They all move on from there without having to wait on one another. However, because of the way conditional variables are implemented, what will actually happen is that they each will wake up one at a time, acquiring the mutex lock, then releasing it. However, while they are being released, they compete with one another, and they also compete with the next write. We profiled this approach, and the result was that we could see how we were spending pretty much all of our time in just synchronizing threads. Instead, we moved to a different approach, in which the first write will actually start off a new thread, dedicated to writing batches. The way it works, when a thread want to write a batch, it will add that to a queue and wake up the background writer thread, then wait on an event. The background writer will read all the current batches and merge them into a single write transaction. When it is done, it will wake up all the sleeping writers. We tried to use TaskCompletionSource for that, initially, but we found that the inline nature of tasks made that too expensive to use. Instead, we use ManualResetEventSlim, and we explicitly wait / wake them. We even reuse events, so we don&#x2019;t have to keep creating and disposing them. The end result is that we have a pretty sequential process for actually doing concurrent writes, which turn it into a simple producers/consumer problem from threading perspective, and the actual writes into a simple write things out as fast as you can process them. This also gives us the chance to do some re-ordering of operations to get better performance overall.</p>
