        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Abstractions have a cost. You should limit them. That seems like an obvious statement, but in a recent discussion I had, I realized that I didn&#x2019;t articulate things in quite the proper way before.  Let me see if I can explain better now. One of the problems in typical applications is that we don&#x2019;t really think before we introduce abstractions. For the purpose of this discussion, an abstraction in an interface. Let us take a look at a sample DDD application.  Nitpicker corner: No, I am not saying avoid using interfaces. I took all the interesting interfaces out of the application, you can see them here:  Take a look at those interfaces. They bother me. They bother me because each of them represent an abstraction that is specific for a particular problem. In other words, it represent an non-abstracted abstraction, if that make any sense. As I said, this is taken a DDD sample application. It isn&#x2019;t a big one (and no, I didn&#x2019;t review the actual code to see if it is a good one), but the interfaces that it has reveal a common problem, namely, interface explosion, or over abstraction. I removed any infrastructure / persistence stuff that was in the app, so you are looking just at the business interfaces, mind. The problem is that the way this application is structured, it is highly procedural and had to maintain. Huh?! I can hear you say, procedural? This is a DDD app, just look at the names, we have services and facades and events and&#x2026; those are all good things. This design is pretty much text book. How can you say that this design is hard to maintain? I&#x2019;ll answer this question (and propose answers) in this series of posts. In the meantime, feel free to look at the code (it is Java, in its origin, and I simply modified it to C# for easier working) and make your own conclusions.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In fact, for over 30 years or so, the Database Wars have been settled, the relational databases have won the fight, and the decision left was which relational database to use. Everyone &#x201C;knows&#x201D; that NoSQL is something that Google invented to handle the amount of data and users they have, and that is it somehow related to scaling to Google or Facebook levels.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And since most of us aren&#x2019;t working on applications that have millions of users, we get to keep using the tried and true methods, no need to bother with something that is only relevant at extreme high scale. The relational database has served us well, and can continue serving us in the future. Learning SQL was a very smart investment, after all.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Let us go back a bit to those Database Wars that I mentioned. In the 70s there were actually quite a lot of different types of databases competing with each other, anything from ISAM to DBase to relational databases. And as you can see, the relational database has won such a decisive victory that it rules undisputed for over a generation.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;But one thing that we have to remember is that those Database Wars were fought on a drastically different ground than the one we have today.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;1980 vs. 2012&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In 1980, a 10 MB hard disk (that is in megabytes, about 2 songs or 3 pictures) cost around 4,000 $ US. Adjusting for inflation, that comes at about 11,000 $ US in today&#x2019;s dollars. Just to compare, today a 10 MB of disk space would cost you about half a dollar cent. And those aren&#x2019;t the only changes, of course. Computation speed, memory sizes and networks are all many orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than they were in the 80s.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Even more interesting is the differences in the type of applications being built. In the 80s, a typical application had exactly one user. Multi users&#x2019; applications had to support&#x2026; 3 users. All of them at the same time! The UI paradigms were drastically different, as well. At the time, the master &#x2013; details form was the top of the hill, the uncontested king of good UI design. But today&#x2026; there are usually so many items and active elements on a single web page today as there were in entire applications then.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Why the history lesson, you ask? Why, to give you some perspective on the design choices that led to the victory of the relational databases. Space was at a premium, the interaction between the user and the application closely modeled the physical layout of the data in the database. That made sense, because there really were no other alternatives given the environment that existed at the time.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That environment is no longer here, and the tradeoffs made when 30 MB would cost as much as an annual salary are no longer relevant. In particular, one immensely annoying aspect of relational database is very much a problem today. Relational databases trade off read speed in favor of write speed. Because it made perfect sense to make this trade off when disk space was so costly, and making users wait an extra second was no big deal.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In separate studies conducted by both Google and Amazon, they found that even additional 100ms added to the latency of a page severely impacted their bottom line. And yet relational database tradeoff read speed (having to do joins and extra loads) for write speed (having to write small amount of data).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Another problem that pops up frequently with relational database is their inability to handle complex data types, such as collections or nested objects. Oh, you can certainly map that to a relational database, but that requires additional tables, and each additional table is going to make it that much more complex to query the data, work with it and display it to the user.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;For many years, I have been working with customers on optimizing their applications using relational databases, and I&#x2019;ve seen the same problems occur over and over again. That led me to the belief that the NoSQL databases aren&#x2019;t suitable just for extremely scalable scenarios. NoSQL databases make sense for a wide range of options, and this realization led me to RavenDB.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;In my company, we are using RavenDB as the backend database for everything from a blog, our ordering and purchasing systems, the daily build server and many more.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The major advantages that we found weren&#x2019;t the ability to scale (although that exists), it is the freedom that it gives us in terms of modeling our data and changing our minds.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Matthew Bonig asks, with regards to a bug in RavenDB MVC Integration (RavenDB Profiler) that caused major slow down on this blog.:  I&#x27;d be very curious to know how this code got published to a production environment without getting caught. I would have thought this problem would have occurred in any testing environment as well as it did here. Ayende, can you comment on where the process broke down and how such an obvious bug was able to slip through? Well, the answer for that comes in two parts. The first part&#xA0; is that no process broke down. We use our own assets for final testing of all our software, that means that whenever there is a stable RavenDB release pending (and sometimes just when we feel like it) we move our infrastructure to the latest and greatest. Why?  Because as hard as you try testing, you will never be able to catch everything. Production is the final test ground, and we have obvious incentives of trying to make sure that everything works.&#xA0; It is dogfooding, basically. Except that if we get a lemon, that is a very public one. It means that whenever we make a stable release, we can do that with high degree of confidence that everything is going to work, not just because all the tests are passing, but because our production systems had days to actually see if things are right. The second part of this answer is that this is neither an obvious bug nor one that is easy to catch. Put simply, things worked. There wasn&#x2019;t even an infinite loop that would make it obvious that something is wrong, it is just that there was a lot of network traffic that you would notice only if you either had a tracer running, or were trying to figure out why the browser was suddenly so busy. Here is a challenge, try to devise some form of an automated test that would catch something like this error, but do so without actually testing for this specific issue. After all, it is unlikely that someone would have written a test for this unless they run into the error in the first place. So I would be really interested in seeing what sort of automated approaches would have caught that.</p>

Obviously we were doing something very wrong there, but what exactly was it? We tracked down the problem to the following code:   As you can probably guess, the problem is that we have what is effective an infinite loop. On any Ajax request, we will generate a new Ajax request. And that applies to our own requests as well. The fix was pretty obvious when we figured out what was going on, but until then&#x2026;</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a review of the Northwind Starter Kit project, this review revision 94815 from Dec 18 2011.  A while ago I said:   Seriously?!&#xA0; 22(!) projects to do a sample application using Northwind? And people took me up to task about it. The criticism was mostly focused on two parts:   I didn&#x2019;t get that the project wasn&#x2019;t about Northwind, but about being a sample app for architectural design patterns.  I couldn&#x2019;t actually decide that a project was bad simply by looking at the project structure and some minor code browsing. I am sad to say that after taking a detailed look at the code, I am even more firmly back at my original conclusion.&#xA0; I started to do a review of the UI code, but there really is no real need to do so. The entire project, as I said in the beginning, is supposed to be a sample application for Northwind. Northwind is a CRUD application. Well, not exactly, it is supposed to be an example of an Online Store, which is something much bigger than just Northwind. But it isn&#x2019;t.  Say what you will, the Northwind Starter Kit is a CRUD application. It does exactly that, and nothing else. It does so in an incredibly complicated fashion, mind, but that is what it does. Well, it doesn&#x2019;t do updates, or deletes, or creates. So it is just an R application (I certainly consider the codebase to be R rated, not for impressionable developers). If you want to have a sample application to show off architectural ideas, make sure that the application can actually, you know, show them. The only thing that NSK does is loading stuff from the database, try as I might, I found no real piece of business logic, no any reason why it is so complicated. So, to the guys who commented on that, it isn&#x2019;t a good project. If you like it, I am happy for you, there are also people who loves this guy:  Personally, I would call pest control.</p>
