            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;ll start with saying that this is not something that is planned in any capacity, I run into this topic recently and decided to dig a little deeper. This post is mostly about results of my research.If you run a file sharing system, you are going to run into a problem very early on. Quite a lot of the files that people are storing are shared, that is a good thing. Instead of storing the same file multiple times, you can store it once, and just keep a reference counter. That is how RavenDB internally deals with attachments, for example. Two documents that have the same attachment (content, not the file name, obviously) will only have a single entry inside of the RavenDB database.When you run a file sharing system, one of the features you really want to offer is the ability to save space in this manner. Another one is not being able to read the users&#x2019; files. For many reasons, that is a highly desirable property. For the users, because they can be assured that you aren&#x2019;t reading their private files. For the file sharing system, because it simplify operations significantly (if you can&#x2019;t look at the files&#x2019; contents,&#xA0; there is a lot that you don&#x2019;t need to worry about).In other words, we want to store the users&#x2019; file, but we want to do that in an encrypted manner. It may sound surprising that the file sharing system doesn&#x2019;t want to know what it is storing, but it actually does simplify things. For example, if you can look into the data, you may be asked (or compelled) to do so. I&#x2019;m not talking about something like a government agency doing that, but even feature requests such as &#x201C;do virus scan on my files&#x201D;, for example. If you literally cannot do that, and it is something that you present as an advantage to the user, that is much nicer to have.The problem is that if you encrypt the files, you cannot know if they are duplicated. And then you cannot use the very important storage optimization technique of de-duplication. What can you do then?This is where convergent encryption comes into play. The idea is that we&#x2019;ll use an encryption system that will give us the same output for the same input even when using different keys. To start with, that sounds like a tall order, no? But it turns out that it is quite easy to do. Consider the following symmetric key operations:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.&#xA;      Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;              Show hidden characters&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          public static byte[] Encrypt(byte[] message, byte[] nonce, byte[] key);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          public static byte[] Decrypt(byte[] cipherText, byte[] nonce, byte[] key);&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          encryption.cs&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;One of the key aspects of modern cryptography is the use of nonce, that ensures that for the same message and key, we&#x2019;ll always get a different ciphertext. In this case, we need to go the other way around. To ensure that for different keys, the same content will give us the same output. Here is how we can utilize the above primitives for this purpose.

First, we compute the cryptographic hash of the message, and use that as the key to encrypt the data. We use a static nonce for this part, more on that later. We then take the hash of the file and encrypt that normally, with the secret key of the user and a random nonce. We can then push both the ciphertext&#xA0;&#xA0; and the nonce &#x2B; encrypted key to the file sharing service. Two users, using different keys, will always generate the same output for the same input in this model. How is that? Both users will compute the same cryptographic hash for the same file, of course. Using a static nonce completes the cycle and ensures that we&#x2019;re basically running the same operation. We can then push both the encrypted file and our encrypted key for that to the file sharing system. The file sharing system can then de-duplicate the encrypted blob directly. Since this is the identical operation, we can safely do that. We do need to keep, for each user, the key to open that file, encrypted with the user&#x2019;s key. But that is a very small value, so likely not an issue.Now, what about this static nonce? The whole point of a nonce is that it is a value that you use once. How can we use a static value here safely? The problem that nonce is meant to solve is that with most ciphers, if you XOR the output of two cipher texts, you&#x2019;ll get the difference between them. If they were encrypted using the same key and nonce, you&#x2019;ll get the result of XOR between their plain texts. That can have catastrophic impact on the security of the system. To get anywhere here, you need to encrypt two different messages with the same key and nonce. In this case, however, that cannot happen. Since we use cryptographic hash of the content as the key, we know that any change in the message will ensure that we have a different key. That means that we never reuse the key, so there is no real point in using a nonce at all. Given that the cryptographic operation requires it, we can just pass a zeroed nonce and not think about it further.This is a very attractive proposition, since it can amounts to massive space savings. File sharing isn&#x2019;t the only scenario where this is attractive. Consider the case of a messaging application, where you want to forward messages from one user to another. Memes and other viral details are a common scenario here. You can avoid having to re-upload the file many times, because even in an end to end encryption model, we can still avoid sharing the file contents with the storage host.However, this lead to one of the serious issues that we have to cover for convergent encryption. For the same input, you&#x2019;ll get the same output. That means that if an adversary know the source file, it can tell if a user has that file. In the context of a messaging application, it can spell trouble. Consider the following image, which is banned by the Big Meat industry:Even with end to end encryption, if you use convergent encryption for media files, you can tell that a particular piece of content is accessed by a user. If this is a unique file, the server can&#x2019;t really tell what is inside it. However, if this is a file that has a known source, we can detect that the user is looking at a picture of salads and immediately snitch to Big Meat. This is called configuration of file attack, and it is the most obvious problem for this scenario. The other issue is that you using convergent encryption, you may allow an adversary to guess about values in the face on known structure. Let&#x2019;s consider the following scenario, I have a system service where users upload their data using convergent encryption, given that many users may share the same file, we allow any user to download a file using:GET /file?id=71e12496e9efe0c7e31332533cb53abf1a3677f2a802ef0c555b08ba6b8a0f9fNow, let&#x2019;s assume that I know what typical files are stored in the service. For example, something like this:Looking at this form, there are quite a few variables that you can plug here, right? However, we can generate options for all of those quite easily, and encryption is cheap. So we can speculate on the possible values. We can then run the convergent encryption on each possibility, then fetch that from the server. If we have a match, we figured out the remaining information.Consider this another aspect of trying to do password cracking, and using a set of algorithms that are quite explicitly meant to be highly efficient, so they lend themselves to offline work. That is enough on the topic, I believe. I don&#x2019;t have any plans of doing something with that, but it was interesting to figure out. I actually started this looking at this feature in WhatsApp:It seams that this is a client side enforced policy, rather than something that is handled via the protocol itself. I initially thought that this is done via convergent encryption, but it looks like just a counter in the message, and then you the client side shows the warning as well as applies limits to it.</p>

However, the second type was run in the main thread only, and there should be no contention on that at all. However, the user was getting a concurrency error on that particular lock, which shouldn&#x2019;t happen. Looking at the logs, it was even more confusing. Leaving aside that we could only reproduce this issue when we had a high contention rate, we saw some really strange details. Somehow, we had a write to the document coming out of nowhere?It took a while to figure out what was going on, but we finally figured out what the root cause was. RavenDB internally does not execute transactions independently. That would be far too costly. Instead, we use a process call transaction merging.Here is what this looks like:The idea is that we need to write to the disk to commit the transaction. That is an expensive operation. By merging multiple concurrent transactions in this manner, we are able to significantly reduce the number of disk writes, increasing the overall speed of the system. That works great, until you have an error. The most common error, of course, is a concurrency error. At this point, the entire merged transaction is rolled back and we will execute each transaction independently. In this manner, we suffer a (small) performance hit when running into such an error, but the correctness of the system is preserved.The problem in this case would only happen when we had enough load to start doing transaction merging. Furthermore, it would only happen if the actual failure would happen on the second transaction in the merged sequence, not the first one.Internally, each transaction does something like this:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Do you see the bug here?The problem was that we successfully executed the transaction batch, but the next one in the same transaction failed. RavenDB did the right thing and execute the transaction batch again independently (this is safe to do, since we rolled back the previous transaction and are operating on a clean slate).The problem is that the transaction batch itself, on the other hand, had its own state. In this case, the problem was that when we replied back to the caller, we used the old state, the one that came from the old transaction that was rolled back.The only state we return to the user is the change vector, which is used for concurrency checks. What happened was that we got the right result, for the old change vector. Everything worked, and the actual state of the database was fine. The only way to discover this issue is if you are continue to make modifications to the same document on the same session. That is a rare scenario, since you typically discard the session after you save its changes.In any other scenario, you&#x2019;ll re-load the document from the server, which will give you the right change vector and make everything work. Like all such bugs, when we look back at it, this is pretty obvious, but to get to this point was quite a long road.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Following my previous post, which mentioned that you can save significantly on disk space if you store a plain text attachment using gzip, we go a feature request:Perhaps in future attachments could have built-in compression as well?The answer to that is no, but I thought that it is worth a post to explain why not. Let&#x2019;s consider the typical types of attachments that you&#x2019;ll store in RavenDB. Based on experience, we usually see:PDF filesWord / Excel / Power PointImages (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc)VideoesDesigns (floor plans, CAD / DWG, etc)Text filesAside from the text files, pretty much all the data you&#x2019;ll store as an attachment is already compressed. In fact, you&#x2019;ll be hard pressed today to find any file format that does not already have built-in compression.Compressing already compressed data is&#x2026; suboptimal. I will not usually lead to significant space savings and can actually make the file size larger. It also burns CPU cycles unnecessarily. It is better to shift the responsibility to the users in this case, since they have a lot more information about what they actually put into RavenDB and won&#x2019;t have to guess.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In distributed systems, the term Byzantine fault tolerance refers to working in an environment where the other nodes in the system are going to violate the invariants held by the system. Sometimes, that is because of a bug, sometimes because of a hardware issue (Figure 11) and sometimes that is a malicious action. A user called us to let us know about a serious issue, they have a 100 documents in their database, but the index reports that there are 105 documents indexed. That was&#x2026; puzzling. None of the avenues of investigation we tried help us. There wasn&#x2019;t any fanout on the index, for example.That was&#x2026; strange.We looked at the index in more details and we noticed something really strange. There were documents ids that were in the index that weren&#x2019;t in the database, and they were all at the end. So we had something like:users/1 &#x2013; users/100 &#x2013; in the indexusers/101 &#x2013; users/105 &#x2013; not in the indexWhat was even stranger was that the values for the documents that were already in the index didn&#x2019;t match the values from the documents. For that matter, the last indexed etag, which is how RavenDB knows what documents to index.Overall, this is a really strange thing, and none of that is expected to happen. We asked the user for more details, and it turns out that they don&#x2019;t have much. The error was reported in the field, and as they described their deployment scenario, we were able to figure out what was going on.On certain cases, their end users will want to &#x201C;reset&#x201D; the system. The manner in which they do that is to shut down their application and then delete the RavenDB folder. Since all their state is in RavenDB, that brings them back up at a clean state. Everything works, and this is a documented manner in which they are working.However, the manner in which the end user will delete is done as: &#x201C;Delete the database files&#x201D;, the actual task is done by the end user. A RavenDB database internally is composed of a few directories, for data and indexes. What would happen in the case where you deleted just the database file, but kept the index files? In that case, RavenDB will just accept that this is the case (soft delete is a a thing, so we have to accept that) and open the index file. That index file, however, came from a different database, so a lot of invariants are broken. I&#x2019;m actually surprised that it took this long to find out that this is problematic, to be honest.We explained the issue, and then we spent some time ensuring that this will never be an invisible error. Instead, we will validate that the index is coming from the right source, or error explicitly. This is one bug that we won&#x2019;t have to hunt ever again.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A user called us with a strange bug report. He said that the SQL ETL process inside of RavenDB was behaving badly. It would write the data from the RavenDB server to the MySQL database, but then it would immediately delete it.From the MySQL logs, the user showed:2021-10-12 13:04:18 UTC:20.52.47.2(65396):root@ravendb:[1304]:LOG: execute &lt;unnamed&gt;: INSERT INTO orders (&quot;id&quot;) VALUES (&#x27;Tab/57708-A&#x27;)2021-10-12 13:04:19 UTC:20.52.47.2(65396):root@ravendb:[1304]:LOG: execute &lt;unnamed&gt;: DELETE FROM orders WHERE &quot;id&quot; IN (&#x27;Tab/57708-A&#x27;)As you can imagine, that isn&#x2019;t an ideal scenario for ETL processes. It is also something that should absolutely not happen. RavenDB issues the delete before the insert, obviously. In fact, for your viewing pleasure, here is the relevant piece of code:It doesn&#x2019;t get any clearer than that, right? We issue any deletes we have, then we send the inserts. But the user insisted that they are seeing this behavior, and I tend to trust them. But we couldn&#x2019;t reproduce the issue, and the code in question dates to 2017, so I was pretty certain it is correct.Then I noticed the user&#x2019;s configuration. To define a SQL ETL process in RavenDB, you need to define what tables we&#x2019;ll be writing to as well as deciding what data to send to those tables. Here is what this looked like:And here is the script:Do you see the problem? It might be better to use an overload, which make it clearer:In the table listing, we had an &#x201C;orders&#x201D; table, but the script sent the data to the &#x201C;Orders&#x201D; table.RavenDB is a case insensitive database, but in this case, what happened behind the scenes is that the code used a case sensitive dictionary to keep track of the tables that we are working with. That meant that what we did was roughly:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

One from the table definitions and one from the script. When we validate that the tables from the script are fine, we do that using case insensitive comparison, so that passed properly.To make it worst, the order of items in a dictionary is not predictable. If this was the iteration order other way around, everything would appear to be working just fine. We fixed the bug, but I found it really interesting that three separate people (very experienced with the codebase) had a look and couldn&#x2019;t figure out how this bug can happen. It wasn&#x2019;t in the code, it was in what wasn&#x2019;t there.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A scenario came up from a user that was quite interesting to explore. Let&#x2019;s us assume that we want to put the Gutenberg Project inside of RavenDB. An initial attempt for doing that would look like this: I&#x2019;m skipping a lot of the details, but the most important field here is the Content field. That contains the actual text of the book.On last count, however, the size of the book was around 708KB. When storing that as a single field inside of RavenDB, on the other hand, RavenDB will notice that this is a long field and compress it. Here is what this looks like:The 738.55 KB is the size of the actual JSON, the 674.11 KB is after quick compression cycle and the 312KB is the actual size that this takes on disk. RavenDB is actively trying to help us.But let&#x2019;s take the next step, we want to allow us to query, using full text search, on the content of the book. Here is what this will look like:Everything works, which is great. But what is going on behind the scenes?Even a single text field that is large (100s of KB or many MB) puts a unique strain on RavenDB. We need to manage that as a single unit, it significantly bloats the size of the parent document and make it more expensive to work with. This is interesting because usually, we don&#x2019;t actually work all that much with the field in question. In the case of the Pride and Prejudice book, the content is immutable and not really relevant for the day to day work with the document. We are better off moving this elsewhere. An attachment is a natural way to handle this. We can move the content of the book to an attachment. In this way, the text is retained, we can still work and process that, but it is sitting on the side, not making our life harder on each interaction with the document. Here is what this looks like, note that the size of the document is tiny. Operations on that size would be much faster than a multi MB document:Of course, there is a disadvantage here, how can we index the book&#x2019;s contents now? We still want that. RavenDB support that scenario explicitly, let&#x2019;s define an index to do just that:You can see that I&#x2019;m loading the content attachment and then accessing its content as string, using UTF8 as the encoding mechanism. I tell RavenDB to use full text search on this field, and I&#x2019;m off to the races.Of course, we could stop here, but why? We can do even better. When working with large text fields, an index such as the one above will force us to materialize the entire field as a single value. For very large values, that can put a lot of pressure in terms of memory usage.But RavenDB supports more than that. Instead of processing a very large string in one shot, we can do that in an incremental fashion, avoiding big value materialization and the memory pressure associated with that. Here is what you can write:That tells RavenDB that we should process the field in a streaming fashion. Here is why it matters:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Value Materialized&#xA;Streaming Value&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;When we are working on a document that has a &lt; 1 MB attachment, it probably doesn&#x2019;t matter all that much (although using 25% of the memory is nice), but it matters a lot more when you are working with larger texts.We can take this one step further still! Instead of storing the attachment text as is, we can compress it, like so:And then in the index, we&#x2019;ll decompress on the fly:Note that throughout all of that, the queries that you send are exactly the same, we are just taking 20% of the disk space and 25% of the memory that we used to.</p>
