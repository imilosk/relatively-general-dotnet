            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Let us get a few things out of the way:&#xA;&#xA;    I am not using TDD. &#xA;    I am not using BDD. &#xA;    I am not using Test After. &#xA;    I am not ignoring testing. &#xA;&#xA;I considered not posting this post, because of the likely response, but it is something that I think it worth at least discussion. The event that made me decide to post this is the following bug:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;public bool IsValid{    get { return string.IsNullOrEmpty(Url); }}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can probably guess, I have an inverted conditional here. The real logic is that the filter is valid if the Url is not empty, not the other way around.&#xA;When I found the bug, I briefly considered writing a test for it, but it struck me as a bad decision. This is code that I don&#x2019;t see any value in testing. It is too stupid to test, because I won&#x2019;t have any ROI from the tests.&#xA0; And yes, I am saying that after seeing that the first time I wrote the code it had a bug.&#xA;The idea behind TDD is to use the tests to drive the design. Well, in this case, I don&#x2019;t have any design to drive. In recent years, I have moved away from the tenets of TDD toward a more system oriented testing system. &#xA;I don&#x2019;t care about testing a specific class, I want to test the entire system as whole. I may switch some parts of the infrastructure (for example, change the DB to in memory one), for perf sake, but I usually try to test an entire component at a time. &#xA;My components may be as small as a single class or as big as the entire NH Prof sans the actual UI pieces.&#xA0; I have posted in the past, showing how I implement features for NH Prof, including the full source code for the relevant sections. Please visit the link, it will probably make more sense to you afterward. It is usually faster, easier and more convenient to write a system test than to try to figure out how to write a unit test for the code.&#xA;Now, let us look at why people are writing tests:&#xA;&#xA;    Higher quality code&#xA;    Safe from regressions&#xA;    Drive design&#xA;&#xA;Well, as I said, I really like tests, but my method of designing software is no longer tied to a particular class. I have the design of the class handed to me by a higher authority (the concept), so that is out. Regressions are handled quite nicely using the tests that I do write. &#xA;What about the parts when I am doing design, when I am working on a new concept?&#xA;Well, there are two problems here:&#xA;&#xA;    I usually try several things before I settle down on a final design. During this bit of churn, it is going to take longer to do things with tests.&#xA;    After I have a design finalized, it is still easier to write a system level test than write unit tests for the particular implementation.&#xA;&#xA;As a matter of fact, in many cases, I don&#x2019;t really care about the implementation details of a feature, I just want to know that the feature works. As a good example, let us take a look at this test:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;public class CanGetDurationOfQueries : IntegrationTestBase{    [Fact]    public void QueriesSpecifyTheirDuration()    {        ExecuteScenarioInDifferentAppDomain&lt;SelectBlogByIdUsingCriteria&gt;();        var first = model.RecentStatements            .ExcludeTransactions()            .First();        Assert.NotNull(first.DurationViewModel.Inner.Value);    }}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;NH Prof went through three different ways of measuring the duration of a query. The test didn&#x2019;t need to change. I have a lot of tests that work in the same manner. Specifying the final intent, rather than specifying each individual step.&#xA;There are some parts in which I would use Test First, usually parts that I have high degree of uncertainty about.&#xA0; The &#x201C;show rows from query&#x201D; feature in NH Prof was develop using Test First, because I had absolutely no idea how to approach it.&#xA;But most of the time, I have a pretty good idea where I am and where I am going, and writing unit tests for every miniscule change is (for lack of a better phrase) hurting my style. &#xA;Just about any feature in NH Prof is covered in tests, and we are confident enough in our test coverage to release on every single commit.&#xA;But I think that even a test has got to justify its existence, and in many cases, I see people writing tests that have no real meaning. They duplicate the logic in a single class or method. But that isn&#x2019;t what I usually care about. I don&#x2019;t care about what a method or a class does.&#xA;I care about what the overall behavior is. And I shaped my tests to allow me to assert just that. I&#x2019;ll admit that NH Prof is somewhat of a special case, since you have a more or less central location that you can navigate form which to everything else. In most systems, you don&#x2019;t have something like that.&#xA;But the same principle remains, if you setup your test environment so you are testing the system, it is going to be much easier to test the system. It isn&#x2019;t a circular argument. Let us take a simple example of an online shop and wanting to test the &#x201C;email on order confirmed&#x201D; feature.&#xA;One way of doing this would be to write a test saying that when the OrderConfirmed message arrive, a SendEmail message is sent. And another to verify that SendEmail message actually send an email.&#xA;I would rather write something like this, however:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;[Fact]public void WillSendEmailOnOrderConfirmation(){    // setup the system using an in memory bus    // load all endpoints and activate them    // execute the given scenario    ExecuteScenario&lt;BuyProductUsingValidCreditCard&gt;();    var confirmation = model.EmailSender.EmailsToSend.FirstOrDefault(x=&gt;x.Subject.Contains(&quot;Order Confirmation&quot;);    Assert.NotNull(confirmation);}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I don&#x2019;t care about implementation, I just care about what I want to assert.&#xA;But I think that I am getting side tracked to another subject, so I&#x2019;ll stop here and post about separating asserts from their scenarios at another time.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had a short discussion with Steve Bohlen about distributed source control, and how it differs from centralized source control. After using Git for a while, I can tell you that there are several things that I am not really willing to give up.     Fast commits    Local history    Easy merging   To be sure, a centralized SCM will have commits, history and merging. But something like Git takes it to a whole new level. Looking at how it changed my workflow is startling. There is no delay to committing, so I can commit every minute or so. I could do it with SVN, but it would take 30 seconds to a minute to execute, blocking my work, so I use bigger commits with SVN.  Having local history means that I can deal with a lot of small commits, because diffing a file from two commits ago is as fast as diffing the local copy. I tend to browse around in the history quite a lot, especially when I am doing stuff like code reviews, or trying to look at how I did something three weeks ago.  Merging is another thing that DVCS excels at. Not so much because of better merge algorithms (although that is a part of this), but simply because having all the information locally make the merge process so much faster.  All in all, it end up being a much easier process to work with. It takes time to get used to it, though.  And given those requirements, Fast commits, Local history, Easy merging, you pretty much end up with a distributed solution. Even with a DVCS, you still have the master repository, but just the fact that you have full local history frees you from having to manage all of that.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It isn&#x2019;t just pair programming that is really useful. I had a problem that I found horrendously complicate to resolve, and I got on the phone with the rest of the team, trying to explain to them what I wanted and how I wanted to achieve that.  Luckily for me, they were too polite to tell me that I am being stop and that I should stop whining. But they were able to guide me toward an elegant solution in about fifteen minutes. Until at some point I had to say: &#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t understand why I thought this was hard.&#x201D;  Getting feedback is important, be it on code or design.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I needed to handle some task recently, so I sat down and did just that. It took me most of a day to get things working.  The problem was that it was a horrible implementation, and it was what you might call fragile:     I don&#x2019;t usually have the patience to tolerate horrible code, so after I was done, I just reverted everything, without bothering to stash my work somewhere where I could retrieve it later. That sort of code is best kept lost.  Time lost: ~12 hours.  I talked with other team members about how to resolve the problem and they made me realize that there isn&#x2019;t a great deal of difficulty in implementing that and that I am just being an idiot, as usual. With that insight, I spent maybe two hours in rebuilding the same functionality in a much more robust manner.  I could also reuse all my understanding on how things should behave, now that I knew all the places that needed to be touched.  Overall, it took me about 14 hours (spread over three days) to implement the feature. Scrapping out everything and starting from scratch really paid off, I invested 15% of the original development time, but I got a robust, working solution.  Trying to fix the previous implementation would have taken me significantly longer, and would result in a fragile bit of code that would likely need to be touched often.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A few weeks ago I had to touch a part of NH Prof that is awkward to handle. It isn&#x2019;t bad, it is just isn&#x2019;t as smooth to work with as the rest of NH Prof.  I had the choice of spending more time there, making this easier to work with, or just dealing with the pain and making my change. Before touching anything, I looked at the commit log. The last commit that touched this piece of NH Prof was a long time ago.  That gave validity to my decision to just deal with the pain of changing it, because it wouldn&#x2019;t be worthwhile to spend more time on this part of the application. Noticing areas of pain and fixing them is important, but I am willing to accept areas of pain in places that I need to touch twice yearly.</p>
