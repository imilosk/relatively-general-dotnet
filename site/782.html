            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the ideas of test first programming is that you shouldn&#x27;t write code that unless you have a failing test. This can be a problem if you are writing code to make a test pass, when you find something new that you want to add, but you don&#x27;t have a test for it. I don&#x27;t like waiting until I am finished with the current test (I forget) and I don&#x27;t like trying to write a new test in the middle of implementing another one. I understand that some people write stuff down, but I hate that, even pulling notepad for a to do is too distracting. Let us say we have this code:[Test]&#xA;public void CanAddToDistributerIfHasEnoughSpace()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;IDistributer distributer = new NavalDistributer()&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;.SetNumberOfContainers(3);&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;distributer.Add( new Container() );&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Assert.AreEqual( 1, distributer.Containers.Count );&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;And the implementation is:public class NavaDistributer : IDistributer&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;int numberOfContainers = 0;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public ICollection&lt;Container&gt; Containers = new List&lt;Container&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public IDistributer SetNumberOfContainers(int numberOfContainers)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;this.numberOfContainers = numberOfContainers;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;public void Add(Container container)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;if(Containers.Count &gt;= numberOfContainers)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;throw new MissingTestException();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Container.Add(container);&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;The check for going over the allowed number of containers is simply shouting at me to build it. But I don&#x27;t have a test for it, so I really shouldn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know what we should do in this case, since I haven&#x27;t given it enough thought. Putting MissingTestException() (often with a descriptive message) keeps me in the flow of the test and satisfy the &quot;you didn&#x27;t handle this case&quot; voice.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had a funny moment today at a meeting, here we were, calmly analyzing what we need to do, when the client has said the Wrong Thing. &quot;We need to add XYZ to the search page&quot;. Me and a coworker had a simultaneous twitch at this. I felt like jumping up in slow motion and screaming &quot;Noooooo!!!&quot;, like in a bad cop&#xA0;film. The search page is undoubtedly the most complex piece of the application. Just the UI portion of the result grid alone was took about two days to build. A quick calculation showed that we have ~15 classes that take parts in building this page, it is interacting with at least three other pages that I can recall off hand and can do anything from producing reports to making coffee.&#xA0;To be clear, the ~15 classes that I am talking about, they are not domain classes or infrastructure stuff, those are classes that exists solely for this page. It is not a page, it is a module, but all of its functionality is exposed  Then I took a deep breath and remembered that I actually have (lots of) tests in place for this, that I am actually capable of running them and that the code is good code.&#xA0; I still don&#x27;t want to touch that page, the last time that we did, we broke this:  Search something Move to the third page Order by date descending Click on second result and go to details page Click on another link in the details page From the second link, go back to the search page (verify that you are still in 3rd page, ordered by date descending) Click on second result and go to details page Click on another link in the details page Boom! I can do any sort of change there, and objectively, there isn&#x27;t anything there that cannot be safely changed, I can assert that my change didn&#x27;t break existing functionality (except stuff like above, which we didn&#x27;t have a test for). Nevertheless, I would like to leave that alone. It is perfect as it is right now, both from UI perspective and from code perspective. I am afraid of another tree view incident, frankly*. I wish we could apply SRP to UI. * Seemingly simple change, with cascading complexity as you start to understand what is required.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, tonight it happened, my other personality jumped on the chance to get me when I was down about the tree view incident, and it took over in the middle of class. Symptoms ranged from fast speaking, cracking jokes* and basically covering a 12 hours material overview in about 20 minutes. Usually it takes three drinks in very small glasses to get him out. I wouldn&#x27;t mind that much except that such incidents burned so much energy while leaving me so jumpy. I can&#x27;t speak right now, because I am just pushing out words faster than I can think about. Oh, and all connection to reality is highly suspect. I have been telling the class a lot of stuff about an imaginary DBA who huff &amp; puff at my lack of reverence for the holy RDBMS for quite some time. During that time in class, I have fleshed my mythical DBA out fairly well. It went like this, and this may not go very well in writing:  So, we have this background worker class, and it makes working with threads easier. But you don&#x27;t know what a thread is. Well, a&#xA0; thread is a piece of work that can be executed, and we need to be careful about it because if we try to do UI from a background thread we will get weird results (pick up a student, tell him to paint something on the board, paint all over it while he is painting, push him back, point to the mess on the board, claim that it is an abstract masterpiece and demand royalties) so the .Net framework will throw an exception if we do that. So now we need to sync between threads, which is not trivial. And by non trivial we are talking about 2 AM at the office, cursing someone in tongues.&#xA0;The background worker class is supposed to help us with that, you give it a piece of work and this piece of work can notify the worker about when it complete a stage, and when everything is over it will notify the UI thread, making our life simpler. So, why would I need this? I have&#xA0;a database, but I don&#x27;t have any permissions to that, since the DBA got pissed after the last time I touched the database. Prickly person, it was only 19 joins and a cursor or two, per page view. Anyway, after that argument I threw the DBA out the window (it was a small window, but quite high), so after which I have to use a three DB links proxy to get to the database, but it wasn&#x27;t found yet, so I am fine. Anyway, this means that a query now takes around an hour to complete, okay, three minutes, but the annoying users tends to complain when they get a white screen and &quot;non responsive&quot; title bars, and we really can&#x27;t murder them (I checked) in their sleep, so we really have to do something about it. And that is why we can use the background worker, so we wouldn&#x27;t have to kill the users. Which remind me of the disuablity study that I have been meaning to investigate. Which is a better way to amuse ourselves when we are faced with boring task. Level one is when you randomly move the cursor by 30 pixels whenever the user is pressing a menu item. So, back to the background worker, we can give it a work like calling to the database through the amazing database proxy** which will take a while, and at the same time, keep the UI responsive, our user sane and ourselves out of jail. Winners all around. *applause* Dedicated to my multi threaded, mythical, DBA. * Politics and threading! For crying out load! ** Sigh, that is a real project.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">How long would it take you to implement the functionality to the left?    I have already spent over a day implementing a tri state tree. The scary part is that I have not even tried to build the tree myself, it was a completely innocent chain of events that led to this stage.    Let me explain a bit about what I am trying to do first. It is a tree that shows the assoication of an entity to a hierarchy. To make a concrete example, let us say that we have an employee entity that should have responsability on a part of the hierarchy. The hierarchy is 5 levels deep, and fairly big.    At first, I tried to simply use the ASP.Net Tree View. That didn&#x27;t work very well. Too much data was sent to the client. So I needed to do lazy load of the tree, using Ajax. The ASP.Net tree view supports that, but, to my utter lack of amazement, not in a way that allows me to plug in easily and handle additional concerns after the load has happened.    Time to write my own tree :-(, that isn&#x27;t very hard, actually, there are numerous examples of tree around, and it was fairly easy to turn MkTree&#xA0;into an ajaxian one. Now I had the proper extension points, and I could turn my mind to the other concerns. As you can see in the picture, there is a checkbox that indicate whatever the user is associated with this node or not. So far, not so hard, I can handle that with ease.    The problem is that I need to handle the third state, where the assoication is in a deeper level, and still show it to the user. So, in a 5 level hierarchy, where the user can be associated to any of the levels (many to many, btw), I need to find out if it is associated with this node or any of its children.     17 left outer joins later (and no, this isn&#x27;t just a number, I really got to that), I realized that I have no idea what I am doing and that I probably want to stop before I reach the triple digit joins statement (don&#x27;t ask, but it was a hand written query, to stem the OR/M sucks complaints) again.    Solved that (with MutliQuery and by thinking about it from the other end), and found out that the hierarchy is so nicely real world, so you can have a 4th level node that doesn&#x27;t have a 3rd level node, which should still go under its grandfather on the 2nd level. And if that is not enough the next issue in line is solving the issue of editing a partially loaded tree, what do I do with the unloaded state? Yuck!    Right now, it is compromised of:            User Control            Two custom server controls            Web Service            JavaScript on the client side            Controller            Create querying with NHibernate            Complex UI interactions    It is a %$#@$&amp; tri state tree view, for crying out load, and I can&#x27;t believe how complex this has turned out to be. And it is not over yet.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jdn has a good post that I recommend that you read about Novices, Sheep and Morts. My feeling about designers, etc is that they are most certainly no inherently bad, they can be extremely valuable to get me someplace quickly. I do think that a lot of the designers, etc in use today are bad, because they produce unmaintainable code. Hell, WCF proxy generator is a good example of one, it doesn&#x27;t recognize the common binding settings, always producing custom binding. It is much easier from the developer point of view, much harder from the user point of view. My objection is for dumbed-down tools, not for the existence of the tools. I don&#x27;t think that it is a good business decision to make use of those for anything but a demo, and I believe that I can, with the use of good framework and maintainable practices, get faster velocity than anyone using the wizards for most kinds of applications. This include the forms over data approach, by the way. &lt;% EditForm(Table: Customers) %&gt; is faster than doing dragging a table to the page.  A *large* number of applications have a clear set of requirements, and they won&#x27;t be extended in the future.&#xA0; You need to handle the requirements that the business users require right now. If an application takes less than a man month to write, you are going to need to maintain it, simply because it is not sustainable to keep adding features to such an application without changing things. Doing it in a way that help maintenance is valuable, even if the application is not going to be significantly extended later on. Fixing bugs, working with the code, etc are all much easier when you write with maintainability in mind. And it is not as if maintainability is some painful tax that you have suddenly acquired, it is simply what happens when you write good code.  And it is *unarguable* that it is easier to use, say, the ObjectDataSource, to accomplish this than to do MVP/MPC.&#xA0; There is *no* argument against this.&#xA0; None.&#xA0; Ha? I would certainly argue that. Just try doing anything remotely interesting with the ODS and you will see my point. The ODS is just a way to call a method to get a data source, and it has such wonder methods that pass me IDictionary of parameters, and expect me to do something with it. That may be good for tabular data, but I don&#x27;t have that.  It is unarguably easier to use a wizard or designer to design the vast majority of applications that are used by businesses around the world.&#xA0; Again, I would certainly argue that. Because you ignore the part that happens after you generated the grid or the form, where you now need to do all the tweaks that the client want (debt rows should be yellow, big debt rows should be red, late returns are marked with an icon, give me row level security and column level filtering, etc).  The code that is produced by using designers, wizards, etc. is more easily maintained by people who aren&#x27;t alpha-geeks. Here is something that I can&#x27;t really understand. If alpha geeks can&#x27;t maintain this code, why would others be able to do so? Unmaintainable is just it. And I have worked on creative solutions to a lot of technical problems that stemmed from the fact that I wanted to do it the RAD way, and have came to regret it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, it looks like the vote goes decidefully for MonoRail, so that is what I am going to build it with. I have setup a project here:         https://rhino-tools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rhino-tools/trunk/SampleApplications/Hibernating.Forums    I have decided to take advantage of this series and show some other cool stuff that I have used, from the Repository&lt;T&gt; &amp; NHQG to Binsor and MonoRail Windsor Integration.    The application is basically just UI and configuration right now. I did some very rough strcuturing of the UI in a way that should help me work on it.    The most interesting part is probably the windsor configuration:            import System.Reflection                        import Castle.MonoRail.Framework                        import Castle.MonoRail.WindsorExtension                                &#xA0;                        Facility( &quot;rails&quot;, RailsFacility )                                &#xA0;                        webAsm = Assembly.Load(&quot;HibernatingForums.Web&quot;)                        activeRecordAssemblies = ( Assembly.Load(&quot;HibernatingForums.Model&quot;), )                                &#xA0;                        for type in webAsm.GetTypes():                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; if typeof(Controller).IsAssignableFrom(type):                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Component(type.Name, type)                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; elif typeof(ViewComponent).IsAssignableFrom(type):                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Component(type.Name, type)                                &#xA0;                                &#xA0;                        Component(&quot;active_record_repository&quot;, IRepository, ARRepository)                        Component(&quot;active_record_unit_of_work&quot;,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; IUnitOfWorkFactory,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; ActiveRecordUnitOfWorkFactory,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; assemblies: activeRecordAssemblies )        I will probably start recording tomorrow (unlikely) or on Friday.</p>
