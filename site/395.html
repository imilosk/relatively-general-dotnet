        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, so in my last post (and last night, from my perspective), I wrote about the process in which LMDB maintains the B-Tree when it grows. But what about when it shrinks? And how does LMDB handle things like reusing space? For that matter, we need to discuss another thing. As I understand this right now, LMDB is going to write a page once and only once .And when that is done, that page is now immutable. Updates to this page will result in a new page, and the old one will be marked for reuse. So you don&#x2019;t actually have to worry about updating the page while others may be reading it. In other words, I would expect this code to use a lot of pages:  Actually, I would expect it to use two pages all the time. Alternating between the two after every transaction. Indeed, following the code, it is easy to see that this magic happens during mdb_page_touch. We find (somehow, not sure how yet) a free page (or create a new one), and we mark the old one for reuse. That means that when you actually write to the data, you aren&#x2019;t really writing to the old page, you are creating a new one. This drastically reduces a lot of complexity. However, it does mean that the db will be using more space, since every write transaction will use a minimum of one new page (and probably more, considering that there is the B-Tree to maintain). in fact, on average size dbs, I would be surprised if a single transaction could write less than 3 &#x2013; 4 pages as a minimum. I&#x2019;ll test the min number of pages per transaction in a bit, right now I want to focus on the implications of that decision. Well, to start with, concurrency is easier. We aren&#x2019;t writing to old data, so we have MVCC. The only thing we need to ensure is that we aren&#x2019;t reusing a page before all of its transactions are complete. But it also has other implications, I haven&#x2019;t confirmed my suspicions about transaction commits, but because we are writing to new locations, not modifying existing ones, this means that a crash midway would simply restore us to the previous state, and will not corrupt any data.  Since we don&#x2019;t modify pages, it means that free pages aren&#x2019;t just things that happen when we delete data, they happen all the time, so it would be interesting to see how LMDB handles them. Here is the relevant piece of the code:  So either find me a free page, or allocate a new one. Then add the existing page to the free list for the current transaction. A bit lower in the code we copy the data in the old page to the new one, and we are ready to go. So, when we make updates, at least in this scenario, we are cycling between two pages, always allocating one and freeing the other, and on the next transaction we go the other way. This is really quite interesting, from the perspective of comparing that to other storage engines. CouchDB work in pretty much the same way, B-Tree with all the associated benefits. But CouchDB model is based on append only, and it cannot reuse the space in the file, which require compactions. LMDB model is much nicer in that regard. Since in both cases, in place updates are not allowed, there is a lot of wasted space that goes just for those updates. In LMDB&#x2019;s case, that wasted space is a lot bigger, because it works in page sizes, and can reuse them. In CouchDB&#x2019;s case, it doesn&#x2019;t reuse space, so it doesn&#x2019;t use pages (more space efficient this way).  Side note: C&#x2019;s lack of native data structures beyond array is really annoying. You realize that in C, a Stack is a design pattern?! And about the minimum number of pages per transaction, let us see what is going on about that. So I wrote the following code:  This should generate a deep enough B-Tree to show what I want. And indeed, the action happens here:  Both the root node and the data node are modified, because of the cursor stack. It isn&#x2019;t really a big deal, to be honest, since usually you would only need to update H pages (where H is the height of the tree) and H is very small for B-Trees. But this leads to me to consider something else. Usually when talking about on disk structures, one of the more important things that you want to keep in mind is reducing seeks. But the B-Tree model that we have here would result in having pages pretty much all over the file. Now, in something like CouchDB, it doesn&#x2019;t actually matter, because the file is append only, so you always end up scanning from the end of the file backward. But because LMDB is reusing pages, it is entirely possible for a root page to be in the middle of the file, the next level to be in the start and the actual data in the end. Now, I am guessing that this isn&#x2019;t actually an issue, because LMDB relies on the OS page cache to handle this, and that would take care of that. In practice, I expect, the branches of the tree are always going to be in memory, since they were the last written and the most accessed.  And that is enough for now. Next, I want to figure out how we return free pages to the system. In order to do that, I think that I&#x2019;ll need to look at how we transactions are committed.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, so I have a pretty good idea about how things works now, we have transactions, which contains the dirty pages (and a transaction can store up to 128K of pages, so there is a max about 512MB of changes in a single transaction). While inside the transaction, you are using the local dirty pages to get consistent view of the data, and keep track of the freed pages. But how do we actually get it committed, and how does it works with ensuring the DB is ACID? A transaction would go to disk in one of two cases, either it has some dirty pages that it needs to flush, or it has to update the db flags (which aren&#x2019;t really interesting for us right now). The first thing that happen in the transaction commit is that we save the freed pages using mdb_freelist_save. Now, the interesting about this is that we save the freed pages in the file&#x2026; in the file. This leads to some really interesting code, in which you are trying to write to the B-Tree about free pages, and during the write, you are freeing pages, so you need to record that too. The data about free pages is stored in the FREE_DBI, and it is stored there with the transaction id as the key, and the list of freed pages as the value. There is also a bunch of code there that refers to overflow pages, but I am going to skip that for now. And now, this is probably the most important part:  mdb_page_flush() will write all the data to disk. If using writable mmap, by just updating the memory and clearing the dirty flag, or by doing file I/O. The next part, mdb_env_sync basically just call fsync() on the newly written data. But that just make sure that the data is on disk, it doesn&#x2019;t commit it yet. This is done via mdb_env_write. Since this is the most essential part of the commit, it is interesting to see how LMDB ensure that this is safe. If you remember, when we created the file we saved the first two pages as copies of the environment metadata. At the time, I wasn&#x2019;t sure why that was the case. It brought to mind the CouchDB&#x2019;s method of writing the start of the B-Tree in the start of the file twice, to ensure safety. But I think that the LMDB method is better, what it does, the first time, it create a duplicate entry. After that, however, it works by alternating between the two. One transaction will flush the data to the first page and the next to the second one. When starting up, LMDB will read the two entries and select the most recent of them. It is a really nice way of handling this. But I think that I would be happy with a better way to handle corruptions. For example, a CRC32 or something like that, to make sure that this isn&#x2019;t actually a failed write that got midway through. Next up, I need to figure out how this applies with regards to selecting a free page with respect to the oldest running transaction&#x2026; But that is a topic for the next post.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I thought that I would stop a bit from focusing on what the LMDB code is doing in favor to some observations about the code itself. Going into this codebase it like getting hit in the face with a shovel. Now, this might be my personal experience, as someone who has done a lot of managed code work in the past. But I used to be a pretty horrible C/C&#x2B;&#x2B; guy (the fact that I say C/C&#x2B;&#x2B; should tell you exactly what my level was).  But I don&#x2019;t think that it was just that. Even beyond the fact that the code is C, and not C&#x2B;&#x2B; (which I am much more used to), there is a problem that only become clear to me well after I read the code for the millionth time. It grew. Looking at the way the code is structured, it looks like it was about as nice a C codebase as you can get (don&#x2019;t get excited, that isn&#x2019;t saying much). But overtime, features were added, but the general structure of the codebase wasn&#x2019;t adjusted to account for that. I am talking about things like this:         There are actually 22 (!) &#x2018;if(IS_LEAF(mp))&#x2019; references in the codebase. Or what about this?     It looks like certain features (duplicate keys support, for example) was added that had a lot of implication on the code, but it wasn&#x2019;t refactored accordingly. It make it very hard to go through.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I don&#x2019;t know if you noticed,&#xA0; but the LMDB codebase is giving me serious headache issues. The bloody thing is a very dense piece of code, but at the same time, it is also quite interesting. In particular, B-Trees are pretty much The Answer for a lot of on disk data structures, but they tend to be quite hard to handle properly. So I am looking forward to this piece of code, in which I am going to figure out if I can figure out this code. Just to note mdb_page_split is also another 400 lines method with goto sprinkled all over.  In order to do that, I wrote the following code (in a single transaction):  And then I spent another few minutes trying to get it to compile. Mostly because I started out with &#x201C;for (int i=0; &#x2026;&#x201D; and C doesn&#x2019;t allow that (blah!). Anyway, I got the page to split, and now I want to see how it actually behaves. I am currently at the first part where we take the root (currently leaf) page and turn it into a branch. This is an interesting case of a root split.  We start with:  And the first thing we do is to go to this mode:  We add an empty implicit pointer to the previous root. But this is really just the beginning, now we need to divide the entries that used to be in the root between the left &amp; right sides. This is made complex by the fact that you might have it setup so it has a few large &amp; small values, so just cutting them in the middle would produce a result that would be too big. At least, that is what a comment says. I am not sure how that can be. We are going from one page to two pages, so I don&#x2019;t see how you can get into a situation where that would happen. I guess it is time to slot into more code.  Okay, I got it, the issue is that we do a page split because we need to add a new item. So that is the reason we have to jump through those hops. Because we add a new item (that is already too big for the original page, since that is why we are actually splitting that). Another complex issue with page splits is that they might be recursive. If we need to split a page, we need to add an entry to the parent page, which might cause that page to split, etc&#x2026; An interesting observation on the sizes involved, a LMDB page has 4084 bytes available for storage. The data for the page number is 8 bytes long (it uses pointer size page number) and assuming keys that are 16 bytes keys in size (and including about 8 bytes for node header), we get about 128 keys per branch page. Even considering that B-Tree are specifically designed to make themselves efficient in the presence of memory hierarchies, it is&#xA0; quite impressive. Consider, assuming a full tree, if we hold just the root and the first level in memory, we would consume about 512kb. And that would give us just one seek to get any of ~2 million items. As an aside, one reason that I like reading this code is that for once, this is a B-Tree implementation that isn&#x2019;t covered in locking code, which is how this is usually works in RDBMS.  Another aspect that is quite interesting is that this code really shows important aspects for working with relational databases. It is all about keeping things inside the same page, with spill over to overflow pages slowing things down because you need to do another seek. Or a really obvious explanation why page splits are such a bad thing, and a lot of other details that you learn when you go a bit deep into relational databases but (at least for me) have never been real before I started dealing with building databases myself.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got a lot of criticism about the posts talking about the interview process. A lot of &#x201C;just be nice&#x201D;, &#x201C;you should give them a chance&#x201D;, &#x201C;how could you say that&#x201D;, and a lot of stuff like that. To those guys, wake up and smell the corpse.&#xA0; Let us call the Zombie on the keyboard Boris. Yes, I know the doll looks female. But for our purposes it is a Zombie female named Boris. I hired Boris at the end of 2011. She was hired for a junior position in HR after some doubts on my parts. Mainly, she didn&#x2019;t shine in the hiring process, but we really needed the additional manpower, and she didn&#x2019;t have anything that was an immediate NO. Just nothing that made me want to say an immediate YES. We started Boris using pretty much the same way we start junior devs, learning the ropes by doing some non essential tasks. In Boris&#x2019; case, that was done by building the public daily builds site for us. I thought it was a good way to getting started, it meant getting surface familiarity with RavenDB, and it was something that we needed. By the way, we have since then replaced that site, don&#x2019;t bother looking for that. Boris needed a lot of help at first, but that was natural for a new hire, especially a junior one. We spent quite a bit of time with her, showing her the ropes, how things work, etc. But it took her a long time to do things, and in the end, it was quite apparent that it would be easier to do things myself than tell Boris to do them. If I did things myself, it would be done. If I told Boris to do them, I would have to explain what I wanted, come over and help several times, come over again and fix the broken pieces. Explain some more about what was wrong, and finally pretty much write it myself. Now, that is something that I am perfectly fine with, for the first two times. The third and forth times, maybe. But if you don&#x2019;t get what is going on after a few explanation, there are two options. Either Boris couldn&#x2019;t get it, or I wasn&#x2019;t explaining things in a way Boris could get it. Either way, it didn&#x2019;t matter, Boris didn&#x2019;t get it. And even assuming that the fault lie in me, which I am absolutely willing to do. That didn&#x2019;t really matter. About 3 months after we hired her, Boris was let go with our best wishes, but without any regrets. In fact, my major regret was letting it go for so long, because I really didn&#x2019;t want to admit that Boris was a bad fit. Now, let us review what Boris cost us:  3 months of salary &amp; benefits.  Not hiring someone else that could have done better.  Quite a lot of my and the other guys&#x2019; time.  It doesn&#x2019;t really matter how you spin it, Boris was a huge net loss for us. Not theoretical &#x201C;I could have that&#x201D; loss, but a real measurable loss that set us back by quite a bit. On the other hand, we have had a recruiting cycle that didn&#x2019;t pan out. The end result that we didn&#x2019;t get anyone. Net loss, purely theoretical from our part. We reached out to a partner and got help from known good people. What I think is crucial to understand is that I actually have access to a really good group of people that I can work with. Most of them are remote, and most of them are only available for part of the time. But getting really good people, and I mean awesome people, of the kind that &#x201C;you just blew my mind&#x201D; people is not a big deal. I have access to them, and if I have enough work for that level of talent, I can probably get them for several months of pure work. I don&#x2019;t shy around or talk behind people&#x2019;s back, and when I tell you that they have world&#x2019;s class talent. I mean it. When I am looking for local people, I am looking for people that can compete with that level of talent. Because remote work is useful and great, but it ain&#x2019;t the same. And that is why every now and then we do a recruiting cycle, to see if we can find people that match our expectations. In other words, the cost of making a bad hire would be money and time (much more costly!) down the drain. The cost of not making a hire is having to rely on good people that might live in a different timezone or take vacations on a strange schedule.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The posts about our interviews seems to have strike a nerve in some people. So I thought I would respond here to all the comments at once. Some stats about our hiring process:  We worked with 2 recruitment agencies, looking for a 5&#x2B; years experience in C#/.NET, Server Side work, OSS experience / NoSQL experience, multi threading, TCP/IP, REST&#x2026;  We got 23 CVs to review, and did phone interviews for most of them.  We actually interviewed 9 candidates, had 3 potential hires and made an offer to 2 of them. Unprofessional &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t know about you, but a large part of running a business is finding good people. And having people that are severely under qualified show up is a problem. In the same way that I talk about problems in code or silly patterns or horrible processes, the part about hiring people is just as important. I am quite careful about not giving away any details, but that is about it. I&#x2019;ve had people comment that I am gloating. But nothing could be further from the truth, if anything, those are mournful posts. Because if that is the state of the industry&#x2026; Those are insulting questions &#x2013; a few people said that they thought that the questions were insulting. Look at the numbers, we had two thirds of the people fail to answer them. I had a candidate with 13&#x2B; years of experience who looked quite promising get up and leave mid interview because the candidate couldn&#x2019;t solve a string sort problem with full internet access. I had people submit code that made my eyes bleed.&#xA0; And I think that people don&#x2019;t understand something about those questions. The coding questions won&#x2019;t get you hired. The coding questions are there to keep you from getting hired. The assumption is that you should be able to solve those questions blindfolded while dancing the cha-cha and typing with your left earlobe.  Due to the large number of people who can talk the talk but not walk the walk, I am assuming all candidates incompetent until proven otherwise. And yes, I absolutely agree that this is a sad state of affairs. Those are not relevant questions &#x2013; &#x201C;In these days on the Internet, I&#x27;m not at all sure I do care someone knows how to sort a string.&#x201D; Well, we are building databases, we actually care quite a lot about things like sorting. But leaving that aside, we don&#x2019;t actually care how you do the sorting. Most candidate uses List&lt;T&gt;.Sort, and that was fine. But I think that the key point is, if you have internet access and an hour, and you can&#x2019;t implement a sort algorithm, you don&#x2019;t get to work here. You should be mentoring them, not discouraging them &#x2013; I think that someone just missed a turn in the road to reality. I didn&#x2019;t show up at a Teach Kids to Program and laughed at their inability to do three stars code. I was conducting interviews for a senior position. That meant that I was limiting candidates to 5&#x2B; years experience. Actually going through the interview process cost us. A lot. It effectively shut us down for a day or two, and took about three full days just to do the interviews.&#xA0; There is a serious cost here.  And having people that are drastically unqualified show up and take our time is a very costly waste. Look at the number above. Out of 23 people, I posted about 3, because they crossed all the limits that I can think of. In contrast, we had a bunch of other people we talked to or even interviewed that didn&#x2019;t make the cut for being potential hires. They weren&#x2019;t bad by any means, but they just weren&#x2019;t what we were looking for. I am not sorry, if you don&#x2019;t show up ready to answer stuff that a first year student should be able to, you are cheating. Certainly me, and probably yourself. At that point, I&#x2019;m going to stop wasting my time and move on to more productive avenues.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As mentioned, the data in LMDB is actually stored in page. And I am currently tracking through the process in which we add a new item to the database. The first thing that happen is that we allocate a leaf page. I think that I&#x2019;ll have to go over how pages are allocated now, which should explain a lot about how LMDB reuses disk space. A new page is allocated by first finding the oldest transaction that is still active. This is how LMDB implements MVCC. Basically, any free page that is older than any existing transaction is eligible for reuse. The first db (although a better term would be to call it btree, or maybe a table) contains the free pages, and at first we search there for an available page. If we can&#x2019;t find such a page, we use the end of the file for that. This happens in mdb_page_alloc. An very interesting aspect is the fact that LMDB allows direct memory writes (with the additional risk of corrupting the db if you messed the data), interestingly, this is done in the following code:  If the options allows directly memory writes, you get a point to the mmap file. Otherwise, LMDB will allocate a page (or re-use one that has already been allocated). I am not really sure what is going on with the insert yet. This is a function pointer (delegate for C#). And it select which behavior will happen later on. I am just not sure what those two different function do yet. I think I got it, the key is here:  You can see that we use the insert method to add the mid variable to the dirty list. So if we give you a direct pointer, we append it to the list. But if we give you allocate a page, we need to add it in order.  The mdb_mid2l_insert will add an item to the list in the appropriate location to ensure sorting. I think that this is done so when we actually write the dirty page to disk, if we do that using file I/O, we will do that in ascending file order, so we can get good seek times from the disk. A new page has 4,084 bytes available for it (12 bytes are taken by header data).  A database is actually created the first time data is written to it. The root page is allocated and recorded. And then the data is added to the page. As you might recall, data inside a page is kept in a sorted list. But remember that the data is also stored on the page, and there is the whole notion of overflow pages, so I think that I am going to have to draw a picture to figure out what is going on.  This is more or less how it works. But I don&#x2019;t think that I really get it. Note that there are two collections here. First is the positions of nodes in the page, and the second is the node themselves. The reason we have this complexity is that we need to maintain both of them in an efficient manner. And we need to do that without too much copying. Therefor, the list of nodes in the page is in the beginning, growing downward, and the actual nodes are in the end, growing upward. The page is full when you can&#x2019;t fit anything between those two lists. A node, by the way, is the LMDB internal name for a key (and maybe data). But I think that I might have an error here, because I don&#x2019;t see the code here to actually add nodes to the page in a sorted fashion, so it might be doing linear search on the content of a node. I am not tracking through the code for adding a second value into a database. And I think that I have to be wrong about linear node search. The code I was looking at was invoked at the the new db creation section, so it might be taking shortcuts that aren&#x2019;t generally available. At any rate, the logic for adding an item goes like this&#x2026; first we need to find the appropriate page. And we do this by starting from the root and asking for the actual page. Which gets us to mdb_page_get, where we have the following:  The really interesting part here is that each transaction have a dirty list of pages, so if you modified a page, you&#x2019;ll get your own version, even before the data was committed. Otherwise, we will just hand you the current version. This is quite nice.  And then we get to the already familiar mdb_page_search_root function, and I can confirm that the nodes in a page are actually sorted, which only make sense. I am not sure where that happens yet, but I have got the feeling that I am going to see that in a bit. Okay, I am going to go on a bit of a rant here, mostly against C, to be honest.  Take a look at this code. mdb_page_search does something, but what it does it mutate the state for the cursor (mc), and you are then going to access the mc-&gt;mc_pg[mc-&gt;mc_top] to get the actual result you wanted. To make things more interesting, the is also a mc-&gt;mc_ki, which is the index of the node inside the node. And it drove me crazy, because I just couldn&#x2019;t see the association between those three values, especially because I am so not used to this type of code that I never even considered this as a possibility. At any rate, now I know how it gets to insert things in the right order. When doing mdb_page_search, it calls to mdb_node_search, which does the appropriate setup to tell the next call where it need to actually do the insert to get things in a sorted fashion. I am currently in the mdb_cursor_put, which is trice cursed and really hard to follow. A 400&#x2B; lines method with gotos galore.  But I am in the section where we are actually going to be writing a new value. (new_sub: goto header, if you care). And the code is pretty straight forward from there. Next up, I want to see how it handles a page split, but that is a subject to another post.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, I just finished interviewing a candidate. His CV states that he has been working professionally for about 6 years or so. The initial interview was pretty well, and the candidate was able to talk well about his past experience. I tend to do a generic &#x201C;who are you?&#x201D; section, then give them a couple of questions to solve in front of Visual Studio, an architecture question and then a set of technical questions that test how much the candidate knows. Mostly, I am looking to get an impression about the candidate, since that is all I usually have a chance to do in the span of the interview. The following is a section from the code exercise that this candidate has completed: for (int i = 0; i &lt; sortedArrLst.Count; i&#x2B;&#x2B;)&#xA;{&#xA;    if (sortedArrLst[i].Contains(escapeSrt[0]))&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (sortedArrLst[i].IndexOf(escapeSrt[0]) == 0)&#xA;        {&#xA;            sortedArrLst[i] = sortedArrLst[i].Remove(0, escapeSrt[0].Length&#x2B;1);&#xA;            escapeStrDic.Add(sortedArrLst[i], escapeSrt[0]);&#xA;        }&#xA;        &#xA;    }&#xA;    if (sortedArrLst[i].Contains(escapeSrt[1]))&#xA;    {&#xA;        if (sortedArrLst[i].IndexOf(escapeSrt[1]) == 0)&#xA;        {&#xA;            sortedArrLst[i] = sortedArrLst[i].Remove(0, escapeSrt[1].Length&#x2B;1);&#xA;            escapeStrDic.Add(sortedArrLst[i], escapeSrt[1]);&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Thank you, failure to use loops will get your disqualified from working at us.&#xA;Then there were the gems such as &#x201C;mutex is a kind of state machine&#x201D; and &#x201C;binary search trees are about recursion&#x201D; or the &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll use perfmon to solve a high CPU usage problem in production&#x201D;.&#xA;Then again, the next candidate after that was quite good. Only 4 &#x2013; 6 to go now.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It is that time again, we are looking for more developers. And this time I ended up so pissed after an interview I had to call a sick colleague just to vent. One candidate I ruled out early during the interview process. It was a somewhat sinking sensation in the pit of my stomach as I spoke with the candidate, and I couldn&#x2019;t get a single actually technical description about what the candidate is actually doing now. A lot of broad descriptions, and a lot of sweeping statements, but no real technical details. But the candidate did know jQuery mobile back &amp; forth, it appears. The decision was made final when I asked the candidate what web framework they were using. I asked whatever they were using ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET MVC or ASP.Net Web API. Note that from my perspective, it is a list in a ascending worth order, and you you are using something not on it, that is a plus (it means you aren&#x2019;t just using whatever is available, which is nice). So I was quite excited when the candidate said (confusedly) &#x201C;none of them&#x201D;. Then it took me putting on my investigative hat and asking a lot of questions about how they are actually doing things before it finally came out that they were doing ASPX. Not knowing the name of the environment in which you are working with for the past several years&#x2026; I am not sure what to call it. At least the candidate was able to let me know how they were using that in great detail. We do stuff in Page_Init, then we have&#xA0; a method that load the data from the database and put it in the ViewState or the Session, then we bind it to a grid, and most of the code is in the grid event handlers. I am sure that the candidate is a great web developer, but I would rather that this particular candidate be great at another location. The second candidate actually passed our phone screen and was invited to an interview. We have a fairly basic interview process. Some background information for both sides, then a few questions that you need to solve in Visual Studio (and yes, you have full MSDN &amp; Google access) and then a technical portion of the interview that include a system design and a more detailed set of technical knowledge questions. Now, I am sure that you have heard about interesting interview questions like sort a 100 GB file in a machine 32 bits with 512MB of memory. I admit that something like that would be challenging and interesting. I would probably quite enjoy seeing how people deal with that.  That is not the type of questions that we ask. I asked for a &#x201C;sort these strings&#x201D; and a &#x201C;calculate this tax&#x201D; programs. I gave the candidate about an hour and a half, alone in a room with VS and internet connection. I am not even asking to implement your own sort, just customize the comparison function and run the standard .NET sort. And do some basic math. The candidate was unable to finish either problem on the time allotted. Now, to be fair for the candidate, the way he solved the first problem was correct and much better than many other attempts that I have seen. Note that the issue was an IComparable&lt;string&gt; instead of IComparable&lt;Item&gt; that caused the issue. It is subtle and something that I would expect an newbie to catch. But this candidate came with full 6 years of experience.  Okay, I said to myself, it is natural to be nervous when doing interviews, let us see what the candidate knows beyond that. The CV mentioned that work with mutli threading. So I began with some questions about that. But it appears that &#x201C;I only know Thread and BackgroundWorker&#x201D;. But the absolute clincher was when I asked the candidate about what would cause a high CPU problem and how to diagnose that: &#x201C;Well, I think that there are special tools that will tell you which process is using the CPU&#x2026;&#x201D; Special tools? Well, I guess Task Manager can be called special, but I am not really sure that I would call it that .And if your experience in troubleshooting stuff never go to the point where you actually look at Task Manager to see what is going on&#x2026; it probably means that you don&#x2019;t have meaningful experience in actually troubleshooting stuff.</p>
