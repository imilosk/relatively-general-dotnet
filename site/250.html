            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We are on the verge of releasing RavenDB 4.0 release candidate, currently the release is set to mid next week but we&#x2019;re close enough that I can smell it. Once the release pressure is off, I can start discussing more of the things that we bring to the table. For the record, we are now standing on less then 30 remaining issues before we can ship RC, most of them relating to licensing. And speaking of this, we made a couple of decisions lately that you should probably know about.First, we are switching to the RavenDB 4.0 pricing starting next week, for the period of the RC, we&#x2019;ll even go with 30% discount. In other words, you can do a bit of arbitrage and get a license now at the old pricing, we&#x2019;ll grandfather in all existing orders when we make the switch.Second, regarding the free community edition. After a lot of deliberations, I decided that community edition as we wanted to offer it made no sense. RavenDB 4.0 is a distributed, robust database, and we want to encourage people to use us in real world settings. Because of that, we decided to scrap the limits on running the community edition as a cluster.&#xA0; This means that you&#x2019;ll be able to deploy a full blown RavenDB cluster for production using just the community edition.Third, we decided to change the pricing model a bit. Instead of you purchasing a license per server, which caused a lot of back &amp; forth between our sales people and customers, we decided to move to a flat per core model. In other words, if you need to deploy 3 node cluster with 4 cores each, you&#x2019;ll purchase a cluster license for 12 cores. You could then deploy that cluster on up to 12 machines (with 1 core assigned for each machine in this case). This simplify things significantly and it gives a lot more flexibility to the operations team. Here is a rough draft of what this would look like. You can see a 16 cores cluster license and that we assigned 3 cores to Node A.The community edition we&#x2019;ll provide will have 3 cores and a maximum of 3 nodes in the cluster. This will allow you to have a single RavenDB node, or a cluster of three nodes with one core each, given you high availability, automatic failover, etc. There are still things that aren&#x2019;t in the free edition (ETL, cloud backups, monitoring, support, etc) but the idea is that you could run real things on the free edition and that you could upgrade when your needs actually require it.I&#x2019;m really excited about this because it means that features that are currently Enterprise only are now pushed all the way to the community edition. This gives you the chance to use a world class distributed database that was built with an explicit design goal of being correct, fast and easy to use.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is another cool feature that is best explained by showing, rather than explaining.Consider the following cluster, made of three nodes. On this cluster, we created the following database:This data is hosted on node B and C, so we have a replication factor of 2, here is how the database topology looks like:And now we are going to kill node B.The first thing that is going to happen is that the cluster is going to mark this node as suspect.&#xA0; In this case, the M on node C stands for Member, and the R on node B stands for Rehab.Shortly afterward, we&#x2019;ll detect that it is actually down:And this leads to a problem, we were told that we need to have a replication factor of 2 for this database, but one of them is down. There is a grace period, of course, but the cluster will eventually decide that it needs to be proactive about it and not wait around for nodes long past, hoping they&#x2019;ll call, maybe.So the cluster is going to take steps and do something about it:And it does, it added node A to the database group. Node A is added as a promotable member, and node C is now responsible for catching it up with all the data that is in the database. Once that is done, we can promote node A to be a full member in the database. We&#x2019;ll remove node B from the database entirely, and when it come back up, we&#x2019;ll delete the data from that node. On the other hand, if node B was able to get back on its feet, it would be now be a race between node A and node B, to see who would be the first node to become up to do and eligible to become full member in the cluster again.In most cases, that would be the pre-existing node, since it has a head start on the new node. Clients, by the way, are not really aware that any of this is happening, the cluster will manage their topology and let them know which nodes they need to talk to at any given point. Oh, and just to let you know, these images, they are screenshots from the studio, you can actually see this happening live when we introduce failure into the system and watch how the cluster recovers from it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I can talk about this feature for quite some time, but it is really hard to explain via text. I even prepared an animated GIF that I was going to show here, but I draw the link at &lt;blink/&gt; tag (and yes, I know that dates me).Honestly, the best way to see this feature is in action, and we&#x2019;ll be doing some videos doing just that once RavenDB is in Release Candidate mode, but I just couldn&#x2019;t sit on this feature any longer. I actually talked about it a few times in the blog, but I don&#x2019;t think anyone really realized what it means.Let us consider the following three nodes cluster:It has a few responsibilities,&#xA0; we need to do a daily backup, and there are a couple of offsite replicas that needs to be maintained. The cluster assign the work to the various nodes and they are each responsible for doing their part. However, what happens when a node goes down?In this case, the cluster detect that and dynamically redistribute the work among the other nodes in the cluster. &#xA0;Work can be things like backups, replicating outside of the cluster or managing batch jobs.In fact, because we have a node failure, the cluster has assigned C to be the mentor of node A when it will come up again, letting it know about all the changes in the database while it was down, but I&#x2019;ll talk about that feature on another post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A few months ago I wrote about the etag simplification in RavenDB 4.0, but ironically, very shortly after that post, we had to retire the etag almost entirely. It is now relegated to semi retirement within the scope of a single node. Instead, we have the notion of a change vector. Those of you familiar with distributed system design may also know that by the term vector clock.The basic problem is that an etag is not sufficient for change tracking in a distributed environment, and it doesn&#x2019;t provide enough details to know whatever a particular version is the parent of another version or a divergent conflict. One of the core scenarios that we wanted to enable in 4.0 is the ability to just move roles around between servers, and relying on etags for many things make it much harder. For example, concurrency control, caching and conflict detection all benefit greatly from a change vector.But what is it?Let us take a simple example of a database with three nodes. Here is the change vector of one such document.You can see that this document has entries for all three nodes in the cluster. We can tell at what point in history it relates to each of the nodes. The change vector reflect the cluster wide point in time where something happened. We establish this change vector by gossiping about the state of the nodes in the cluster and incrementing our own counter whenever a document is changed locally. In this case, this document was changed on node A, but this node knows that nodes B and C&#x2019;s etag at this point are 1060, so it can include their etag in the timeline as well. This gives us the ability to roughly sort changes in a timeline in a distributed fashion, without relying on synchronized clocks. This also means that when looking at a change vector, I can unambiguously say that this change is after &#x201C;A:1022, B: 391, C: 1060&#x201D; and &#x201C;A:1040, B:819, C: 1007&#x201D;. You might also note that I can also tell that this later two changes are in conflict with one another (since the first contains a higher etag value for C and the second contains a higher change value for A) but that the document that I have in the picture is more up to date then they are and subsumed both updates.Actually, the representation above is a lie, here is what this actually looks like:This is the full change vector, include the unique database id, not just the node identifier. This means that change vectors are also available when you are working with multiple clusters and serve much the same function there. With this, I can go to a server and give it a change vector and see if a document has changed (for caching or cluster wide optimistic concurrency check). This make a lot of things much simpler. Although I probably should note that with regards to optimistic concurrency, we are just checking in this node didn&#x2019;t have any updates on top of the last version the client has seen. RavenDB don&#x2019;t attempt to do any form of cross cluster concurrency, favoring multi master design and merging conflicts if needed. This mode allow us to remain up and functioning even with network splits / major failure, at the cost of having to deal with potentially merging conflicts down the road.</p>
