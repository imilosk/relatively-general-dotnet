            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Sometimes we get requests from customers to evaluate and help specify the kind of hardware their RavenDB servers is going to run on. One of the more recent ones was to evaluate a couple of options and select the optimal one.We got the specs of the two variants and had a look. Then I went and took a look at the actual costs. These are physical machines, and the cost of each of the options we were given, even maxed out, was around 2 &#x2013; 3K $.One of the machines that they wanted was using a 7,200 RPM hard disk and was somewhat cheaper than the other. To the point where we got some pushback from the customer about selecting the other option (with SSD). It took me a while to figure out what was going on.This organization is using RavenDB (and the new machines in question) to run their core business. One of the primary factors in their business in the speed in which they can serve request (for that business, SEO is super critical metric). This business is also primarily focused on getting eyes on the site, which means that their organizational structure looks like this:And the behavior of the organization follow the money. The marketing &amp; sales department is much larger and can steer the entire organization, while the tech (which the entire organization depends on) is decidedly second string, for both decision making and budgeting. I have run into this several times before, but it took me a long while to figure out that in many cases, the result of such arrangements is that the tech department relies on other people (in this case, us) to tell the organization at large what needs to be done. &#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t us (the poor relation) that needs this expensive (add 300$ or so) add on, but the database guys says that it really matters (and you&#x2019;ll take the blame if you don&#x2019;t approve it)&#x201D;.I don&#x2019;t have anything to add, I&#x2019;m afraid, I just wanted to share this observation. I&#x2019;m hoping that understanding the motivation can help alleviate some of the hair pulling involved in those kind of interactions (yes, water is wet, and spending a very small amount of money is actually worth it).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">With RQL in RavenDB 4.0, we have a whole new set of capabilities during queries. In the RC1 release of RavenDB we had limited support for expressing the more complex queries in a strongly typed fashion using Linq. If you needed more complex queries, you had to drop to RQL strings. With the RC2 release, we bring you strongly typed and quite powerful queries using Linq. Let us see how this looks like for a very simple query:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This isn&#x2019;t really interesting, but it does show that we can do projections directly from the server side. Let us see something a bit more complex, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This query is more interesting, because you can see that we are doing something that you previously had to create a transformer for. We are loading a related documents during the query and projecting a field from it back to the user. In fact, you can even go crazy and define even more complex behavior in the query:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;In this case, we load two related documents and define a formatting function for names, which we can then apply on two documents. This kind of code eliminates the need to have transformers entirely, and this makes me very happy.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When talking about the security errors we generate in RavenDB 4.0, we got some really good comments, which are worth discussing.&#xA0; The following are some of the interesting tidbits from the comments there.can this behavior help some malevolent user trying to hack the system?at least make it an admin setting so by default it just gives a 403 and you have to turn on the detailed error reporting.I&#x27;m not questioning the technical decision, but simply the fact to returning info to the user. simply logging this error server-side, or activate this behavior to a specific admin setting as Paul suggests, looks more &quot;safe&quot; to me.often when you log to an account with wrong user or password, error message don&#x27;t specify of password or username is wrong. just an example.Let me start from scratch and outline the problem. We are using a x509 certificate to authenticate against the server. The user may use the wrong / expired / invalid certificate, the user may use no certificate or the user may use a valid certificate but attempt to do something that they don&#x2019;t have access to.By default, we can just reject the connection attempt, which will result in the following error:We consider such an error utterly unacceptable. So we have to accept the connection, figure out what the higher level protocol is (HTTP, usually, but sometimes can be our own internal TCP connection) and send an error that the user can understand. In particular, we send a 403 HTTP error back with a message saying what the error is.The worry is that there is some information disclosure inherent in the error message. Let us analyze that:a request without a certificate, we error and announce that they didn&#x2019;t use a certificate, and that one is required. There is no information here that the user is not already in possession of. They may not be aware of it, but they are in possession of the fact that they aren&#x2019;t using a certificate. a request with an expired certificate, we error and let the user know that. The user already have the certificate, and therefor can already figure out that it is expired. We don&#x2019;t disclose any new information here, except that the user may try to use this to figure out what the server time is. This is generally not sensitive information and it can be safe to assume that it is close to what the rest of the world believe to be the current time, so I don&#x2019;t see anything here that should worry us.a request with a certificate that the server doesn&#x2019;t know about. This result in an error saying that the server doesn&#x2019;t know about the certificate. Here we get into actual information disclosure issue. We let the user know that the certificate isn&#x2019;t known. But what can they gain from this? In the case of username / password, we always say that the username or password is incorrect, we shouldn&#x2019;t let the user know if a username already exists and that just the password is wrong. This is because it provide the user with information that it didn&#x2019;t have (that the username is correct). Now, in practical terms, that is almost never the case, since you have password reset links and they tend to tell you if the email / username you want to reset the password to is valid.However, with a certificate, there aren&#x2019;t two pieces of information here, there is just one, so we don&#x2019;t provide any additional information.A request with a certificate to do an operation that the certificate isn&#x2019;t authorized to do. This will result in one of the following errors:There are a few things to note here. First, we don&#x2019;t disclose any information beyond what the user has already provided us. The operation and the database are both provided from the user, and we use the FriendlyName so the user can tell what the certificate in question was.Note that this check run before we check whatever the database actually exists on the server, so there isn&#x2019;t any information disclosed about the existence of databases either.Given that the user tried to perform an operation that they are not allowed to, we need to reject that operation (honey pot behavior is a totally separate issue and probably shouldn&#x2019;t be part of any sane API design). Given that we reject the operation, we need to provide clear and concise errors for the user, rather than the CONNECTION REFUSED error. Given the kind of errors we generate, I believe that they provide sufficient information for the user to figure out what is going on.As to whatever we should log this / hide this behind a configuration setting. That is really confusing to me. We are already logging rejected connections, because the admin may be interested in reviewing this. But requiring to call the admin and look at some obscure log file is a bad design in terms of usability. The same is true for hiding behind a configuration option. Either this is a secured solution, and we can report these errors, or we have to put the system into a known unsecured state (in production) just to be able to debug a connection issue. I would be far more afraid from that scenario, especially since that would be the very first thing that an admin would do, any time that there is a connection issue. So this is the default (and only) behavior, because we have verified that this is both a secured solution and a sane one.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We couldn&#x2019;t make unique constraints work in RavenDB 4.0 in a way that made sense for distributed operations, there were just too many hurdles at that level of abstractions. The problem, in essence, boils down to having to do an atomic operation in a distributed environment.&#xA0; When we need to do this in an multi threaded environment, we can rely on interlocked operations to help us. In the same manner, RavenDB offers the notion of interlocked distributed operations.&#xA;Let us take a look at how this looks like, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

At the most basic level, this gives us the ability to create unique constraints, because we are able to reserve values for particular documents, and it gives us a much more explicit manner in which to do so. If a user wants to change their username, we first try to grab the new name, change the username and then release the old username. And we have the ability to recover if there are errors midway.&#xA;This design is modeled after the Interlocked operations, and is meant to be used in the same manner. You submit such an operation to the cluster, which will run this through the Raft state machine. This means that you can rely on RavenDB&#x2019;s own distributed state machine to get reliable distributed operations, including the full consistency that this provides. The key arguments here is that the name of the value and the index used. If the index you provide match the index on the state machine, we&#x2019;ll replace the value in an atomic fashion. Otherwise, the operation will fail and you&#x2019;ll get the current value and index so you can decide if you want to try again.&#xA;The example with the unique constraints is just the tip of the iceberg. You can also use this for your own use for things like distributed locking by registering an owner for a particular lock key and ensuring that everyone who needs the lock will race to acquire it. Note that the value that we use here can be anything, including complex objects. In other words, you can do things like set a lock descriptor that would include timeout information, owner, etc.&#xA;The interface here is pretty small, in addition to PutCompareExchangeValueOperation there is also just GetCompareExchangeValueOperation, but it is enough for you to be able to lean on RavenDB&#x2019;s distributed state machine in your own application.</p>

Following our Python client (and obviously the .NET one), this is the newest client for RavenDB on the block, with additional clients for the JVM, Go and Ruby quickly reaching critical stage.Here is some code using it (I&#x2019;m using async/await here, but the RavenDB node.js client supports any Node 6.0 or higher):And here is how you do some basic CRUD:A full sample app can be found here:Async/Await syntaxPromises syntaxYou can just get the code and then run:npm run serveAnd you&#x2019;ll get a running server running against the public live instance.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Unique Constraints is a bundle in RavenDB 3.x that was allowed you to&#x2026; well, define unique constraints.&#xA0; Here is the classic example:&#xA;&#xA;It was always somewhat awkward to use (you had to mess around with configuration on both the server and the client side, but it worked pretty well. As long as you were running on a single server.&#xA;With RavenDB 4.0, we put a lot more emphasis on running in a cluster, and when the time came to discuss how we are going to handle unique constraints in 4.0 it was very obvious that this is going to be neither easy nor performant.&#xA;The key here is that in a distributed database using multi masters, there is no real good way to provide a unique constraint. Imagine the following database topology:&#xA;&#xA;Now, what will happen if we&#x2019;ll create the two different User documents with the same username in node C? It is easy for node C to be able to detect and reject this, right?&#xA;But what happen if we create one document in node B and another in node A? This is now a much harder problem to deal with. And this is without even getting into the harder aspects of how to deal with failure conditions.&#xA;The main problem here is that it is very likely that at the point we&#x2019;ve discovered that we have a duplicate, there were already actions taken based on that information, which is generally not a good thing.&#xA;As a result, we were left in somewhat of a lurch. We didn&#x2019;t want to have&#xA0; feature that would work only on a single node, or contain a hidden broken invariant. The way to handle this properly in a distributed environment is to use some form of consensus algorithm. And what do you know, we actually have a consensus algorithm implementation at hand, the Raft protocol that is used to manage the RavenDB cluster.&#xA;That, however, led to a different problem. The process of using a unique constraint would now broken into two distinct parts. First, we would verify that the value is indeed unique, then we would save the document. This can lead to issues if there is a failure just between these two operations, and it puts a heavy burden on the system to always check the unique constraint across the cluster on every update.&#xA;The interesting thing about unique constraints is that they rarely change once created. And if they do, they are typically part of very explicit workflow. That isn&#x2019;t something that is easy to handle without a lot of context. Therefor, we decided that we can&#x2019;t reliably implement them and dropped the feature.&#xA;However&#x2026; reliable and atomic distributed operations are now on the table, and they allow you to achieve the same thing, and usually in a far better manner. The full details will be in the next post.</p>
