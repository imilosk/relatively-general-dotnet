            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into a really interesting discussion on Twitter, I suggest you go over the whole thread, it is fascinating reading. I have written DI / IoC business applications for a decade and I was heavily involved at a popular IoC container for about five years, including implementing some core features (open generic binding, which was a PITA to do). Given the scope of the topic, I didn&#x2019;t want to try to squeeze my thoughts on the subject into a Twitter soundbite, hence, this post.A couple of weeks ago I posted about how I would start a new project today. With just enough architecture to get things started, and not much more. Almost implicit in my design is the fact that the system is composable. You add functionality to the system not by modifying existing code but by adding code. That isn&#x2019;t new by any means. A quick search of my blog shows a series of posts from 2012 and a system architecture from 2008. No new ground trodden here, then. So why bother writing this post?RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t use a container. This is a pretty big and non trivial project that has no container involved. In fact, I don&#x2019;t usually pull in containers any longer. For a long while, I tried to push as much complexity as possible into the container. It helped that I was part of the team building the container, so I could actually go ahead and add features to the container. That allowed me to create a system that was driven by convention. As long as you followed the convention, things magically worked and everyone was productive. If you didn&#x2019;t follow the convention, well, I would need to debug that. Other people on the team could figure things out, but it generally fell on me (not that I minded).The backend for RavenDB Cloud is the first time in a while that I took part in what you can consider as a business application rather than an infrastructure component. And that backend uses a container, IoC, interfaces, multiple dispatch, etc. It makes for a codebase that can adapt quickly, but also adds complexity. In the case of the cloud backend, just to name a few core features, we have: storage, machine allocations, recovery from failure, billing and monitoring. Each one of those may have multiple implementations (each cloud does storage and deployment differently, different accounts have different plans, etc).&#xA0; Much of this is handled via implementing the relevant interfaces and dispatching to the right location based on the context of the operation. In many ways, it works like magic. And it allows us to iterate quick and deploy to three separate cloud providers in a short amount of time. It is also magic. Much of our team is actually infrastructure developers. That has a totally different mindset than business app development. When I saw how these developers, with the infrastructure background, worked with the cloud backend, it was very instructive. To them, it was magic, and impenetrable at first. Interestingly enough, they didn&#x2019;t need to understand all that was going on to get things done. We made sure that they did, after a while, but the IoC allowed us to ignore such concerns until later (gimme a cluster, don&#x2019;t worry about how it is wired to the rest of the system).The auto-wiring is one part of what you&#x2019;ll typically get from a container. There are other, equally important parts, that don&#x2019;t generally get as much attention: Using IoC usually means a decomposed systems, which is easier to test independently. And in addition to satisfying dependencies, the container is also in charge of managing the lifetime (or scope) of instances.Let&#x2019;s talk about the decomposed system and isolated testing first, because this tend to be a high priority for many people. I&#x2019;m against such systems. Not because it makes testing easier (although keep that in mind, I&#x2019;ll have something to say about it shortly) but because it is generally a very short slippery slope toward interface explosion. You end up with a lot of interfaces that have a single implementation. You now have composition issue, it is hard to figure out what is the flow of the code because everything is dynamically composed. That lead to a bunch of problems when you read the code (you have to jump around to understand what is going on) as well as performance issues (you can&#x2019;t inline methods, you have to do interface calls, etc). Out of those, the first issue is far more important, mind. Surprisingly, given that we have decomposed to small pieces to be able to work with each item independently, we are now in a much worst position if we want to change something. Because the code is scattered in many different locations and is composed on the fly, if I want to make a significant change, I have to make it in many places. To give a concrete example, let&#x2019;s say that I need to pass a correlation token through my system, to do distributed tracing. I have to modify pretty much all the interfaces involved to pass this token through. And that lead us to the issue I promised with the tests. A system that is composed of independent interfaces / implementations is easy to test in isolation. Because each implementation is independent and isolated from other areas of the system. The issue with such a system is that each individual component isn&#x2019;t really doing much on its own. The benefit of the system is from multiple such components are assembled and working together. So the critical functionality that you have is the composed bundle, as well as the container configuration. But to test that, you need a system test. So you might as well structure you system so that system tests are easy, fast and obvious. Here is another way to do just that. Finally, we get to the issue of lifetime management. It is easy to ignore just how important this feature is. Usually, you have three lifetimes in your application:Singleton &#x2013; for the entire application.Transient &#x2013; get a new instance each time.Scoped &#x2013; get the same instance in the same scope (typically a single requests).Being able to rely on the container to manage lifetime is huge, because it is easy to mess things up. A good container will also match dependencies by their lifetimes. So if you have a singleton component it cannot accept a transient component since the lifetimes don&#x2019;t match (but the other way around is obviously fine). There is an issue here as well. If you are injecting the dependencies, it is easy to lose track of the lifetime of your dependencies. It is easy to get into a situation where you (inadvertently, even) use a dependency to manage state between invocations and not realize that you have now relying on the lifetime of a dependency (or a dependency of dependency).You might have noticed a theme in this post. I&#x2019;m outlining a lot of problems, but no solutions. I&#x2019;ll get to that in a bit, but I wanted to explain something important. Writing non trivial software is complex. This is the nature of the beast. We can re-arrange the complexity or we can sweep it under the rug. There are good use cases for either option, but I would rather that people make this choice explicitly. What you can&#x2019;t do is eliminate the complexity entirely, at best, you have tamed it.Earlier, I said that RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t use a container, which is true (somewhat). But it is using inversion of control. A lot of the core classes are using constructor injection, for example. Let&#x2019;s take what is probably the most important class we have, DocumentDatabase. That is the class that represent a database inside a RavenDB process. It accept its dependencies (the configuration, the server it is running on, etc) and then is constructed. We don&#x2019;t use a container here because the setup process of a database in RavenDB is complex. We first create the DocumentDatabase instance, then we have to initialize it. Initializing a database may mean running recovering, loading a lot of data from disk, etc. So we do that in an async manner. When a request comes in for a particular database, we get it, or wait until it is loaded. We will also dispose the database if it has been idle for enough time. So in this case, we have complex (async) initialization, in which we have to deal with a lot of failure modes. We also have a lifetime scope that is based on idle time, which doesn&#x2019;t fit the usual modes for a container.Because we manually control how we create the database instance, it is explicit what its dependencies, lifetime and behavior are. We have quite a few example of such classes. For example, the database instance holds DocumentStorage, AttachmentStorage, etc. It is important to note that the number if finite and relatively small. It allow us to reason about the interaction in the database in a static and predictable manner. Remember when I said that we don&#x2019;t use a container? That is almost true. There is one location where I wrote our own mini container. One thing that RavenDB has a lot of is Endpoints. An endpoint is the method that handles a particular HTTP request. At last count we had over 300 of them. I don&#x2019;t have the time / willingness to wire all of these manually. That would put undue burden on developing a new endpoint. And that is the key observation. For stuff that doesn&#x2019;t change very often (the structure of the database), we do things manually. For the things that we add a lot of (endpoints), we make it as smooth as possible. Adding a new endpoint is adding a class that inherit from a known base class, and that is pretty much it.Our routing infrastructure will gather all of the implementation, wire up the routing and when a request come in will create an instance of the class in question, inject it the relevant context (what database it is running on, the current request, etc) and then execute it. Just like a container would, in fact, because for all intents and purposes, it is one. What we have done is optimize one aspect, which we deal with often, while manually dealing with the stuff that is rarely changing. That means that if I do need to make a change there, the level of magic involved is greatly reduced. And in RavenDB in particular, we can and have measured the difference in performance between running things through any abstraction layer and doing things directly. To the point where in certain parts of our codebase, an interface method invocation is forbidden because the cost would be too high.There is another aspect of this architecture, it means that the easiest thing in our code would be to add a new endpoint. That being the easiest thing, it is usually what will happen. This means that we&#x2019;re far more likely to follow the open/closed principal. It also lead to most of our code looking fairly similar in shape. That make maintenance, code reviews and the act of writing new code a lot simpler. I don&#x2019;t have to make decisions about structure, I just have to let the code flow.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my last post, I talked about how to store and query time series data in RavenDB. You can query over the time series data directly, as shown here:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

We could also query over all documents that match a particular query, of course. One thing to note, however, is that time series queries are done on a per time series basis and each time series belong to a particular document.In other words, if I want to ask a question about time series data across documents, I can&#x2019;t just query for it, I need to do some prep work first. This is done to ensure that when you query, we&#x2019;ll be able to give you the right results, fast.As a reminder, we have a bunch of nodes that we record metrics of. The metrics so far are:Storage &#x2013; [ Number of objects, Total size used, Total storage size].Network &#x2013; [Total bytes in, Total bytes out]We record these metrics for each node at regular intervals. The query above can give us space utilization over time in a particular node, but there are other questions that we would like to ask. For example, given an upload request, we want to find the node with the most free space. Note that we record the total size used and the total storage available only as time series metrics. So how are we going to be able to query on it? The answer is that we&#x2019;ll use indexes. In particular, a map/reduce index, like the following:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Usually in RavenDB, the source of an index is a docs.[Collection], such as docs.Users. In this case, we are using a timeseries index, so the source is timeseries.[Collection].[TimeSeries]. In this case, we operate over the Storage timeseries on the Nodes collection. When we create an index over a timeseries, we are exposed to some internal structural details. Each timestamp in a timeseries isn&#x2019;t stored independently. That would be incredibly wasteful to do. Instead, we store timeseries together in segments. The details about how and why we do that don&#x2019;t really matter, but what does matter is that when you create an index over timeseries, you&#x2019;ll be indexing the segment as a whole. You can see how the map access the Entries collection on the segment, getting the last one (the most recent) and output it. The other thing that is worth noticing in the map portion of the index is that we operate on the values of the time stamp. In this case, Values[2] is the total amount of storage available and Values[1] is the size used. The reduce portion of the index, on the other hand, is identical to any other map/reduce index in RavenDB.What this index does, essentially, is tell us what is the most up to date free space that we have for each particular node. As for querying it, let&#x2019;s see how that works, shall we?Here we are asking for the node with the least disk space that can contain the data we want to write. This can be reduce fragmentation in the system as a whole, by ensuring that we use the best fit method.Let&#x2019;s look at a more complex example of indexing time series data, computing the total network usage for each node on a monthly basis. This is not trivial because we record network utilization on a regular basis, but need to aggregate that over whole months.Here is the index definition:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

This is done because a single segment may contain data from multiple months. We then sum up the values for each month and compute the total in the reduce.The nice thing about this feature is that we are able to aggregate large amount of data and benefit from the usual advantages of RavenDB map/reduce indexes. We have already massaged the data to the right shape, so queries on it are fast.Time series indexes in RavenDB allows us to merge time series data from multiple documents, I could have aggregated the computation above across multiple nodes to get the total per customer, so I&#x2019;ll know how much to charge them at the end of the month, for example.I would be happy to know hear about any other scenarios that you can think of for using timeseries in RavenDB, and in particular, what kind of queries you&#x2019;ll want to do on the data.</p>

We have gotten to the point where we can actually show off what we can do, which makes me very happy. You can use the nightlies builds to explore time series support in RavenDB 5.0. Client side packages for 5.0 are also available.I went ahead and created a new database and created some documents:Time series are often used for monitoring, so I decided to go with the flow and see what kind of information we would want to store there. Here is how we can add some time series data to the documents:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

A time series in RavenDB has the following details:The timestamp to associate to the values &#x2013; in the code above, this is the current time (UTC)The tag associated with the timestamp &#x2013; in the code above, we record what devices and interfaces these measurements belong to.The measurements themselves &#x2013; RavenDB allows you to record multiple values for a single timestamp. We threat them as an array of values, and you can chose to put them in a single time series or to split them.Let&#x2019;s assume that we have quite a few measurements like this and that we want to look at the data. You can explore things in the Studio, like so:We have another tab in the Studio that you can look at which will give you some high level details about the timeseries for a particular document. We can dig deeper, too, and see the actual values:You can also query the data to see the patterns and not just the individual values:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

RavenDB is able to do quite well in these areas. For example, to aggregate over 11.7 million heartrate details over 6 years at a weekly resolution takes less than 50 ms. We have tested timeseries that contained over 150 million entries and we can aggregate results back over the entire data set in under three seconds. That is a nice number, but it doesn&#x2019;t match what dedicated time series databases can do. It represents a rate of about 65 million rows / second. ScyllaDB recently published a benchmark in which they talk about billion rows / sec. But they did that on 83 nodes, so they did just 12 million / sec per node. Less than a fifth of RavenDB&#x2019;s speed.But that is being unfair, to be honest. While timeseries queries are really interesting, we don&#x2019;t really expect users to query very large amount of data using raw queries. That is what we have indexes for, after all. I&#x2019;m going to talk about this in depth in my next post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When it comes to security, the typical question isn&#x2019;t whatever they are after you but how much. I love this paper on threat modeling, and I highly recommend it. But sometimes, you have information that you just don&#x2019;t want to have. In other words, you want to store information inside of the database, but without the database or application being able to read said information without a key supplied by the user.&#xA;For example, let&#x2019;s assume that we need to store the credit card information of a customer. We need to persist this information, but we don&#x2019;t want to know it. We need something more from the user in order to actually use it.&#xA;The point of this post isn&#x2019;t actually to talk about how to store credit card information in your database, instead it is meant to walk you through an approach in which you can keep data about a user that you can only access in the context of the user.&#xA;In terms of privacy, that is a very important factor. You don&#x2019;t need to worry about a rogue DBA trawling through sensitive records or be concerned about a data leak because of an unpatched hole in your defenses. Furthermore, if you are carrying sensitive information that a third party may be interested in, you cannot be compelled to give them access to that information. You literally can&#x2019;t, unless the user steps up and provide the keys.&#xA;Note that this is distinctly different (and weaker) than end to end encryption. With end to end encryption the server only ever sees encrypted blobs. With this approach, the server is able to access the encryption key with the assistance of the user. That means that if you don&#x2019;t trust the server, you shouldn&#x2019;t be using this method. Going back to the proper threat model, this is a good way to ensure privacy for your users if you need to worry about getting a warrant for their data. Basically, consider this as one of the problems this is meant to solve.&#xA;When the user logs in, they have to use a password. Given that we aren&#x2019;t storing the password, that means that we don&#x2019;t know it. This means that we can use that as the user&#x2019;s personal key for encrypting and decrypting the user&#x2019;s information. I&#x2019;m going to use Sodium as the underlying cryptographic library because that is well known, respected and audited. I&#x2019;m using the Sodium.Core NuGet package for my code samples. Our task is to be able to store sensitive data about the user (in this case, the credit card information, but can really be anything) without being able to access it unless the user is there.&#xA;A user is identified using a password, and we use Argon2id to create the password hash. This ensures that you can&#x2019;t brute force the password. So far, this is fairly standard. However, instead of asking Argon2 to give us a 16 bytes key, we are going to ask it to give us a 48 bytes key. There isn&#x2019;t really any additional security in getting more bytes. Indeed, we are going to consider only the first 16 bytes that were returned to us as important for verifying the password. We are going to use the remaining 32 bytes as a secret key.

We are getting 48 bytes from Argon2id using the password. We keep the first 16 bytes to authenticate the user next time. Then we generate a random 256 bits key and encrypt that using the last part of the output of the Argon2id call. The function returns the generated config and the encryption key. You can now encrypt data using this key as much as you want. But while we assume that the CryptoConfig is written to a persistent storage, we are not keeping the encryption key anywhere but memory. In fact, this code is pretty cavalier about its usage. You&#x2019;ll typically store encryption keys in locked memory only, wipe them after use, etc. I&#x2019;m skipping these steps here in order to get to the gist of things.&#xA;Once we forget about the encryption key, all the data we have about the user is effectively random noise. If we want to do something with it, we have to get the user to give us the password again. Here is what the other side looks like:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Without the user&#x2019;s password, we are blocked from using their data, great!&#xA;You&#x2019;ll also notice that the actual key we use is random. We encrypt it using the key derived from the user&#x2019;s password but we are using a random key. Why is that? This is to enable us to change passwords. If the user want to change the password, they&#x2019;ll need to provide the old password as well as the new. That allows us to decrypt the actual encryption key using the key from the old password and encrypt it again with the new one.&#xA;Conversely, resetting a user&#x2019;s password will mean that you can no longer access the encrypted data. That is actually a feature. Leaving aside the issue of warrants for data seizure, consider the case that we use this system to encrypt credit card information. If the user reset their password, they will need to re-enter their credit card. That is great, because that means that even if you managed to reset the password (for example, by gaining access to their email), you don&#x2019;t get access tot he sensitive information.&#xA;With this kind of system in place, there is one thing that you have to be aware of. Your code needs to (gracefully) handle the scenario of the data not being decryptable. So trying to get the credit card information and getting an error should be handled and not crash the payment processing system . It is a different mindset, because it may violate invariants in the system. Only users with a credit card may have a pro plan, but after a password reset, they &#x201C;have&#x201D; a credit card, in the sense that there is data there, but it isn&#x2019;t useful data. And you can&#x2019;t check, unless you had the user provide you with the password to get the encryption key.&#xA;It means that you need to pay more attention to the data model you have. I would suggest not trying to hide the fact that the data is encrypted behind a lazily decryption fa&#xE7;ade but deal with it explicitly.</p>
