            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just merged a Pull Request from one of our guys. This is a pretty important piece of code, so it went through two rounds of code reviews before it actually hit the PR stage.&#xA;That was the point where the tests run (our test suite takes over an hour to run, so we run a limited test frequently, and leave the rest for later), and we got three failing tests. The funny thing was, it wasn&#x2019;t a functional test that failed, it was the code quality gateways&#xA0; tests.&#xA;The RavenDB team has grown quite a lot, and we are hiring again, and it is easy to lose knowledge of the &#x201C;unimportant&#x201D; things. Stuff that doesn&#x2019;t bite you in the ass right now, for example. But will most assuredly will bite you in the ass (hard) at a later point in time.&#xA;In this case, an exception class was introduced, but it didn&#x2019;t have the proper serialization. Now, we don&#x2019;t actually use AppDomains all that often (at all, really), but our users sometimes do, and getting a &#x201C;your exception could not be serialized&#x201D; makes for an annoying debug session. Another couple of tests related to missing asserts on new configuration values. We want to make sure that we have a new configuration value is actually connected, parsed and working. And we actually have a test that would fail if you aren&#x2019;t checking all the configuration properties.&#xA;There are quite a few such tests, from making sure that we don&#x2019;t have void async methods to ensuring that the tests don&#x2019;t leak connections or resources (which could harm other tests and complicate root cause analysis).&#xA;We also started to make use of code analyzers, for things like keeping all complex log statements in conditionals (to save allocations) to validating all async calls are using ConfigureAwait(false).&#xA;Those aren&#x2019;t big things, but getting them right, all the time, give us a really cool product, and a maintainable codebase.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So I was telling my wife about this issue, and she had two interesting comments.&#xA;When I told her that the customer was complaining about performance, she stopped me to figure out what I meant by that. When I told her that they had to wait for 20 minutes, her response was:&#xA;&#xA;Oh, I thought you were talking about 1/16 of a millisecond here again. Well, if it is 20 minutes, why make a fuss about it? They should go have a cup of coffee or something.&#xA;&#xA;The second observation was when I told her that we narrowed things down to suggestions taking up a lot of a CPU:&#xA;&#xA;Oh, so you told them to go and buy some more RPM, right?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A customer called with a major issue, on a customer machine, a particular operation took too long. In fact, it takes quite a bit more than too long. Instead of the few milliseconds or (at worst, seconds), the customer saw a value in the many minutes. At first, we narrowed it down to an extreme load on the indexing engine. The customer had a small set of documents that were referenced using LoadDocument by large number of other documents. That meant that whenever those documents were updated, we would need to reindex all the referencing documents. In their case, that was in the tens to hundreds of thousands of referencing documents in some cases. So an update to a single document could force re-indexing of quarter million documents. Except&#x2026; that this wasn&#x2019;t actually the case. What drove everyone crazy was that here was a reasonable, truthful and correct answer. And on one machine the exact same thing took 20 &#x2013; 30 seconds, and on the customer machine the process took 20 minutes.  The customer also assured us that those documents that everyone referenced are very rarely, if at all, touched or modified, so that shouldn&#x2019;t be the issue. The machine with the problem was significantly more powerful from the one without the problem. This issue also started to occur recently, out of the blue. Tracing the resource utilization in the system showed moderate CPU usage, low I/O and memory consumption and nothing much really going on. We looked at the debug logs, and we couldn&#x2019;t really figure out what it was doing. There were very large gaps in the log where nothing seems to be happening. % Time in GC was low, so that ruled out a long GC pause that would explain the gap in the logs.   This is in version 2.5, which predates all of our introspection efforts, so figuring out what was going on was pretty hard. I&#x2019;ll have another post talking about that in this context later. Eventually we gained access to the machine and was able to reproduce this, and take a few mini dumps along the way. Looking at the stack traces, we found this:   And now it all became clear. Suggestions in RavenDB is a really cool feature, which allows you to ask RavenDB to figure out what the user actually meant to ask. It is also extremely CPU intensive during indexing, which is really visible when you try to pump large number of documents through it. And it is a single threaded process. Except that the customer wasn&#x2019;t using Suggestions in their application&#x2026;  So, what happened, in order to hit this issue the following things all needed to happen:  Suggestions to be enabled on the relevant index/indexes. Check &#x2013; while the customer wasn&#x2019;t currently using it, they were using it in the past, and unfortunately that stuck. A very large number of documents need to be indexed. Check &#x2013; that happened when they updated one of the commonly referenced documents. A commonly referenced document needed to be modified. Check &#x2013; that happens when they started work for next year, which modified those rarely touched documents. Now, why didn&#x2019;t it manifest itself on the other machines? Simple, on those machines, they used the current version of the application, which didn&#x2019;t use suggestions. On the machines that were problematic, they upgraded to the new version, so even though they weren&#x2019;t using suggestions, that was still in affect, and still running. According to a cursory check, those suggestions has been running there for over 6 months, and no one noticed, because you needed the confluence of all three aspects to actually get this issue. Removing the suggestions once we know they were there was very easy, and the problem was resolved.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">&lt;TL;DR&gt; No, it isn&#x2019;t. While&#xA0;SQL is a Turing-complete language and we can use it to encode any business logic we want, placing business (domain) logic into SQL leads to a less maintainable solution comparing to one that uses an OO or functional language. Because of that, I advocate to limit the use of SQL to read-only queries (which can potentially contain business logic, that&#x2019;s fine) and simple CRUD statements where possible.</p>
