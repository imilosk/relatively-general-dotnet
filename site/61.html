        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Voron is RavenDB&#x2019;s storage engine. It is how we store data, keep transactions and in generally get a lot of our abilities. In this post, I want to talk about the way RavenDB manages disk space internally.&#xA0; Voron uses a single data file to do its work, the data file is divided into 8KB pages, like so:Voron uses eager disk allocations to reserve disk space from the operating system. Each time the space inside the file runs out, Voron will double the size of the file. That last until the file size reaches 2GB, after which RavenDB will grow by 1GB at a time. This behavior ensures that Voron gives the underlying file system enough information to provide the database with a continuous range of disk space. In other words, we grab disk space in large chunks to avoid fragmentation of the data file.&#xA0;&#xA0; What happens when you delete data, however? Voron mark the free space in its free list and will use that space before it will allocate more disk space from the operating system.Why aren&#x2019;t we releasing the disk space back to the operating system? The simplest reason is that it isn&#x2019;t an just the data at the end of the file that is freed. In fact, like in the image above, free and busy segments are interwoven in the file. We can&#x2019;t just truncate the file.Internal references inside of RavenDB make use of the position data inside the file, so just moving the data won&#x2019;t help. Instead, you have to compact the data. That forces us to re-write the entire database layout from scratch and fixes those references.&#xA0; That is an offline operation, however. For the most part, it doesn&#x2019;t actually matter. RavenDB will use the internal free space as needed, so it isn&#x2019;t like it is actually lost. One feature that we are considering for version 6.0 of RavenDB is hole punching. That means that we&#x2019;ll make use of advanced file system API to free the disk space allocated to RavenDB even mid file.On Linux, that means using FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE. On Windows, that means using FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA.That will have the advantage of freeing disk space back to the operating system without needing user intervention. In particular, that is going to make it so a user that delete data to free disk space see the free space reflected in the OS metrics.There are problems with this approach, however. First, the size of the file remains the same, which leads to interesting questions. Consider:Second, this defeats the purpose of wanting to optimize disk allocations. If we free disk space in this manner, when we get it back, it may no longer be continuous on the disk. That said, it is not that big a problem in the days of SSDs and NVMes as it was at the time of the rotational hard disk. Then, you may get into a very bad situation in which Voron tries to use disk space that it had allocated mid file (but was already freed) but it can&#x2019;t, because the disk is full. Right now, this is simply an impossible error, with hole punching, we need to consider how to deal with this.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m doing some cloud work, and I am working based off the official documentation, trying to automate the creation of an AWS Lambda. In order to allow me to quickly iterate, I&#x2019;m basically creating the entire thing from scratch each time.&#xA;I have the following code:&#xA;&#xA;aws iam create-role --role-name $AWS_ROLE --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json&#xA;aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name $AWS_ROLE&#xA0; --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole&#xA;aws lambda create-function --function-name $FUNC_NAME --zip-file fileb://lambda.zip --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler&#xA0; --runtime python3.8 --role $ARN_ROLE&#xA;&#xA;So far, so good, and exactly like it shows in the docs. But if you&#x2019;ll run it as a script, it will fail with:&#xA;&#xA;An error occurred (InvalidParameterValueException) when calling the CreateFunction operation: The role defined for the function cannot be assumed by Lambda.&#xA;&#xA;If I re-run the exact same command, however, it works properly.&#xA;There is this interesting command, which indicates that roles are using eventual consistency:&#xA;&#xA;aws iam wait role-exists --role-name $AWS_ROLE&#xA;&#xA;Except&#x2026; that this doesn&#x2019;t work. It looks like there is some additional delay between creating the role, validating that it was created and when it is actually available for Lambda to be used.&#xA;After looking around and feeling like a fool, I added a sleep for 10 seconds to the script, and the problem went away.&#xA;I&#x2019;m posting this for posterity sake and in the hope that someone can tell me that there is a better way. For now, I think I need a shower.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We just published a white paper on RavenDB performance vs. Couchbase performance in a real customer scenario.I had to check the results three times before I believed them. RavenDB is pretty awesome, but I had no idea it was that awesome. The data set was reasonably big, 1.35 billion docs and the scenario we present is a real world one based on production load. Some of the interesting details:RavenDB uses 1/3 of the disk space that Couchbase uses, but stores 3 times as much data.Operationally, RavenDB just worked, Couchbase needed 6 times the hardware to just scrape by. A single failure in Couchbase meant at least 15 &#x2013; 45 minutes for the node to recover. Inducing failures in RavenDB brought the node back up in a few seconds. For queries, we pitted a Couchbase cluster with 96 cores and 384 GB RAM against single RavenDB node running on a Raspberry PI. RavenDB on the Pi was able to sustain better latencies at the 99 percentile handling twice as much load as Couchbase is able.There are all sort of other goodies in the white paper and we went pretty deep into the overall architecture and impact of the difference design decisions.As usual, we welcome your feedback.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">You can hear me speaking at the Angular Show about using document database from the point of view of full stack or front end developers.In this episode, panelists Brian Love, Jennifer Wadella, and Aaron Frost welcome Oren Eini, founder of RavenDB, to the Angular Show. Oren teaches us about some of the key decisions around structured vs unstructured databases (or SQL vs NoSQL in hipster developer parlance). With the boom of document-driven unstructured databases, we wanted to learn why you might choose this technology, the pitfalls and benefits, and what are the options out there. Of course, Oren has a bit of a bias for RavenDB, so we&#x27;ll learn what RavenDB is all about and why it might be a good solution for your Angular application.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the &#x201C;fun&#x201D; aspects of running in the cloud is the fact that certain assumptions that you take for granted are broken, sometimes seriously so. Today post is about an issue a customer run into in the cloud. They were seeing some cases of high latency of operations from RavenDB. In the cloud, the usual answer is to provision more resources, but we generally recommend that only when we can show that the load is much higher than expected to be handled on the hardware.The customer was running on a cluster with disk that were provisioned with 1,000 IOPS and 120 MB /sec, that isn&#x2019;t a huge amount, but it is certainly respectable. Looking at the load, we can see fairly constant writes and the number of indexes is around 30. Looking at the disk, we can see that we are stalling there, the queue length is very high and the disk latency has a user visible impact. All told, we would expect to see a significant amount of I/O operations as a result of that, but the fact that we hit the limits of the provisioned IOPS was worth a second look. We started pulling at the details and it became clear that there was something that we could do about it. During indexing, we create some temporary files to store the Lucene segments before we commit them to the index. Each indexing run can create between four and six such files. When we create them, we do that with the flag DeleteOnClose, this is a flag that exists on Windows, but not on Linux. On Linux, we are running on ext4 with journaling enabled, which means that each file system metadata modification requires a journal write at the file system level. Those temporary files live for a very short amount of time, however. We delete them on close, after all, and the indexing run is very short.6 files per index times 30 indexes means 180 files. Each one of those will be created and destroyed (generating a journal event each time) and there is a constant low volume of writes. That means that there are 360 IOPS at the file system level just because of this issue. The fix for that was two folds. First, for small files, under 128KB, we never hit the disk. We can keep them completely in memory. For larger file, we want to avoid using too much memory, so we spill them to disk, but instead of creating new files each time, we&#x2019;ll reuse them between indexing run.The end result is that we are issuing fewer I/O operations, reducing the amount of trivial IOPS we consume and can get a lot more done with the same hardware. The actual fix is fairly small and targeted, but the impact is felt across the entire system.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the past two posts in the series, I talked about ways to store phone book records in a file. During the candidates review process, I noticed that many candidates failed to make their lives significantly easier by placing limits on themselves.For example:Using variable length records.Using a single file.Choosing simple algorithm to do the whole task.If we force fixed length records, either directly or via record splitting (if each record is 64 bytes, a record that is bigger than that would reside in some multiple of the record size), the task become much easier. I&#x2019;ve mostly ignored that in my code so far because I&#x2019;m using binary offsets, but it can really make the code a lot simpler. Using a single file lead to complications, because you have to do internal space management (where do the records live, where is the metadata?). It also make it much harder to recover used space in many cases. The last one is probably the most interesting limitation, and not something that I would expect a junior developer to figure out. The use of a single option is typically limiting you to whatever a particular algorithm is providing, but you can extend on that significantly.Let&#x2019;s see another approach to building a persistent phone book. I&#x2019;m going to effectively build an LSM here. You can see the code here.I called it a pretty horrible LSM (Log Structure Merge), but all the relevant pieces are there. It is just horribly inefficient. The key problem, by the way, is around the number of times it will open a file handle. That can be really slow on Windows and end up being a real issue for any significant size.There are also probably a lot of other bugs there, but also enough to figure out how this is actually built.And with this post, I can can say that I explicitly scratched this itch.A fun task to take this further, by the way, is to try to implement a persistent trie for the phone book.</p>
