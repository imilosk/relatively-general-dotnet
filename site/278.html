            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This week or early next week, we&#x2019;ll have the RavenDB 4.0 beta out. I&#x2019;m really excited about this release, because it finalize a lot of our work for the past two years. In the alpha version, we were able to show off some major performance improvements and a few hints of the things that we had planned, but it was still at the infrastructure stage. Now we are talking about unveiling almost all of our new functionality and design.&#xA;The most obvious change you&#x2019;ll see is that we made a fundamental&#xA0; change in how we are handle clustering. In prior versions of RavenDB, clusters were created by connecting together database instances running on independent nodes. In RavenDB 4.0, each node is always a member of a cluster, and databases are distributed among those nodes. That sounds like a small distinction, but it completely reversed how we approach distributed work.&#xA;Let us consider three nodes that form a RavenDB cluster in RavenDB 3.x. Each database in RavenDB 3.x is an independent entity. You can setup replication between different databases and out of the cooperation of the different nodes and some client side help, we get robust high availability and failover. However, there is a lot of work that you need to do on all the nodes (setup master/master between all the nodes on each can grow very tedious). And while you get high availability for reads and writes, you don&#x2019;t get that for other tasks in the database.&#xA;Let us see how this works in RavenDB 4.0, shall we? The first thing we need to do is to spin up 3 nodes.&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, we have three nodes, and Node A has been selected as the leader.&#xA0; To simplify things to ourselves, we just assign arbitrary letters to the nodes. That allow us to refer to them as Node A, Node B, etc. Instead of something like WIN-MC2B0FG64GR. We also expose this information directly in the browser.&#xA;&#xA;Once the cluster has been created, we can create a database, and when we do that, we can either specify what the replication factor should be, or manually control what nodes this database will be on.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;Creating this database will create it on both A and C, but it will do a bit more than that. Those aren&#x2019;t independent databases that hooked together. This is actually the same database, running on two different nodes.

And you are correct, but there are some important differences. Instead of specifying a single server url, you can now specify several. And the actual url we provided doesn&#x2019;t make any sense at all. We are pointing it to Node B, running on port 8081. However, that node doesn&#x2019;t have the Northwind database. That is another important change. We can now go to any node in the cluster and ask for the topology of any database, and we&#x2019;ll get the current database topology to use.&#xA;That make it much simpler to work in a clustered environment. You can bring in additional nodes without having to update any configuration, and mix and match the topology of databases in the cluster freely.&#xA;Another aspect of this behavior is the notion of database tasks. Here are a few of them.&#xA;&#xA;Those are tasks (looks like we need to update the icon for backup) that are defined at the database level, and they are spread over all the nodes in the database automatically. So if we defined an ETL task and a scheduled backup, we&#x2019;ll typically see one node handling the backups and another handling the ETL. If there is a failure, the cluster will notice that and redistribute the work transparently.&#xA;We can also extend the database to additional nodes, and the cluster will setup the database on the new node, transfer all the data to it (by assigning a node to replicate all the data to the new node), wait until all the data and indexing is done and only then bring it up as a full fledged member of the database, available for failover and for handling all the routine tasks.&#xA;The idea is that you don&#x2019;t work with each node independently, but the cluster as a whole. You can then define a database on the cluster, and the rest is managed for you. The topology, the tasks, failover and client integration, the works.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A few weeks ago we started looking into what it would take to run RavenDB 4.0 over HTTPS. Oh, not the actual mechanics of that, we had that covered a long time ago, and pretty much everything worked as expected. No, the problem that we set out to solve was whatever we could get RavenDB to Just Work over HTTPS without requiring the admin to jump through hops. Basically, what I really wanted was a way to just spin up the server and have it running on HTTPS by default.That turned out to be a lot harder then I wished it would be. HTTPS has two very distinct goals:To encrypt communication between two parties.To ensure that the site you visited is actually the site you thought you visited.The first portion can be handled by generating the certificate yourself, and the communication between client &amp; server would be encrypted. So far so good, but the second portion is probably more important. If my communication with ThisIsNotPayPal.com is encrypted, that doesn&#x2019;t really help me all that much, I&#x2019;m afraid. Verifying who you are is a very important component of HTTPS, and that is something that we can&#x2019;t just ignore. Well, technically speaking I guess that RavenDB could have installed a root CA into the system during installation, but the mere thought of doing that is giving me a pause, so I really don&#x2019;t want to try and do that.And without doing that, we can&#x2019;t really support HTTPS. Remember that things like Let&#x2019;s Encrypt won&#x2019;t work here. RavenDB is often deployed on closed networks, and without having a publicly visible domain to run. My RavenDB is running on oren-pc.hrhinos.local, for example, and I think you&#x2019;ll find that it is a bit hard to get a Let&#x2019;s Encrypt certificate for this.So we can&#x2019;t just magically get a certificate and have it work. While I wish there was a way to just have encryption over the wire, without validation of identity, that would be pretty pointless with such things as man in the middle attacks.So what do we do in RavenDB 4.0 with regards to HTTPS? We rely on the admin (shocking, I know). They can either generate a self signed certificate and trust it ( a matter of a few shell commands on any platform ) or use their organization&#x2019;s certificate (either trusted internally or externally obtained). RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t care about that, but if you provide a certificate, it will ensure that all communication are SSL encrypted.The client API exposes a method that let you control certificate validation, which make it easier if you need to customize the authentication policy. On the server side, however, we take things differently. Instead of letting the user configure trust policies in certificates, we decided to ignore the issue completely. Or, to be rather more exact, to specify that RavenDB is going to lean on the operating system for such decisions. A simple scenario is an administrator that define a cluster of servers and generate a self signed certificate(s) for them to use. The administrator need to make sure that the certificate(s) in question are trusted by all nodes in the cluster. RavenDB will refuse to connect over HTTPS to an untrusted source. Yes, I&#x2019;m aware of all the horrible things that this can do (certificate expiration kills the system, for example), but we couldn&#x2019;t think of any way were not doing this wouldn&#x2019;t result in even worse situations. RavenDB has support for encrypted databases, but we don&#x2019;t allow them to be accessed from non secured connection, or to connect to non secure destinations. So the data is encrypted at rest and over the wire, and the admin is responsible to making sure that the certs are up to date and valid (or at least trusted by the machines in question).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of very conscious choices we made in RavenDB 4.0 is to use threads. Not just run code that is multi threaded, but actively use the notion of a dedicated thread per task.In fact, most of the work in RavenDB (beyond servicing requests) is done by a dedicated thread. Each index, for example, has its own thread, transactions are merged and pushed using (mostly) a single thread. Replication is using dedicated threads, and so does the cluster communication mechanism. That runs contrary to advice that I have been told many times, that threads are expensive resource and that we should not hold up a thread if we can use async operations to give it up as soon as possible. And to a certain extent, I still very much believe it. Certainly all our request processing is using this manner. But as we got faster and faster we observed some really hard issues with using thread pools, since you can&#x2019;t rely on them executing a particular request in a given time frame, and having a mix bag of operations in a thread pool is a mix for slowing the whole thing down.Dedicated threads give us a lot of control and simplicity, from the ability to control the priority of certain tasks to the ability to debug and blame them properly.For example, here is how a portion of the threads on a running RavenDB server look like in the debugger:And done of our standard endpoints can give you thread timing for all the various tasks we do, so if there is an expensive thing going on, you can tell, and you can act accordingly. All of this has also led to an architecture that is mostly about independent thread doing their job in isolation, which means that a lot of the backend code in RavenDB doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about threading concerns. And debugging it is as simple as stepping through it. That isn&#x2019;t true for request processing threads, which are heavily async, so they are all doing mostly reads. Even when you are actually sending a write to RavenDB, what is actually happening is that we have the request thread parse the request, then queue it up for the transaction merging thread to actually process it. That means that there is usually little (if any) contention on locks throughout the system.It is a far simpler model, and it has proven itself capable of making a very complex system understandable and maintainable for us.</p>
