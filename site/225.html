            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I&#x2019;m going to feel like an old man for this post, but if you were born post 1995, it is likely that you have no idea what I&#x2019;m talking about in this post, crazy as this sounds to me. Before there was a phone in every pocket, there were land lines. It is like today&#x2019;s phone, but much larger, you could only do voice calls and if you wanted to screen your calls you needed to buy another appliance. If you&#x2019;ll watch the first few sessions of Friends, you&#x2019;ll see how important a detail that can be. If you were out of the house or office and needed to place a call, you could use something called a public phone booth or a pay phone. Sadly, the easiest way I can convey what this was is to invoke the Tardis. A small booth in which you had a public access phone. Because phone calls used to cost a lot, these phone had a way to drop some coins or tokens into the phone to pay for the phone call. As a child, I didn&#x2019;t have a wallet and still needed to occasionally make calls. Being stuck without cash at hand wasn&#x2019;t such a strange thing so there was another way to perform the call. You could reverse the charge, instead of the person placing the call paying for it, you could call collect. In that case, the person answering the call would be paying for it. Naturally, since money is involved, you need the other party to accept the charge before actually charging them.At some point in time, you called a special number and told the operator what number you wanted to do a collect call. The operator would ring this number and ask for permission to connect the call and charge the receiver. I think that the rate for a collect call was significantly higher than the normal call, so you wouldn&#x2019;t normally do that.As part of the system automation, the phone company replaced the manual operator collect call with an automated system. You would record a short message, which would be played to the other party. If they wanted to accept the call (and the charge), the could press 1 on the phone, or disconnect to avoid the charge.As a kid, I quickly learned that instead of telling the other party who is calling and why (so they would accept the call), I could just tell them what my phone number is. In this way, they would write down the number, refuse the call and then call me back. That would avoid the collect toll charge.I remember that at some point the phone company made the length of the collect hello message really short, but I got around that by speaking really fast (or sometimes by making two separate calls). I remember having to practice saying the phone number a few times to get it done in the right time.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the absolutely most challenging things in designing software systems is that there is really no such thing is a perfect world. A business requirement that is set in stone turns out to be quite malleable. That can cause quite a big hassle for the development team, as they try to anticipate and address all aspects of change ahead of time.A better alternative would be to not attempt to address all such issues in software, but in wetware. I recently ordered lunch to go at a restaurant. I already paid and was waiting to get my order when the clerk double checked with me that the order is to go. The ordered was entered as if I was going to eat in the location, instead of taking the food away. After I confirmed that I want to take my order to go, I watched how the clerk fixed things up. She went to the kitchen window and shouted, &#x201C;that last order, make it to go&#x201D;. The kitchen staff double checked which order it was, then moved on with their tasks, eventually hanging me a baggie of tasty food to go.On the way back, I kept wondering in my head how a software system would handle something like this. You&#x2019;ll need to shred the idea of &#x201C;an order is immutable once it is paid&#x201D;, for example. Or you&#x2019;ll need to add a side channel of additional instructions to the kitchen, etc. Or, you can ignore the whole thing completely and shout at the cook. In software, that might mean that we&#x2019;ll keep ourselves agile and provide a &#x201C;Manual&#x201D; mode in which a user can enter free text / instructions for the next person on the line to process this.There are some cases where this would be a bad idea, but mostly these are involved not trusting your users to do their jobs. Sometimes, it is literally the software&#x2019;s job to force the users to follow a specific path (usually because management decided that this must be so). However, a really important aspect of design is that it isn&#x2019;t rigid, it allows the user to do their work, instead of working around the software. Part of that involves designing specific places where users can do stuff that you didn&#x2019;t think that they would need.For example, in an order, having a &#x201C;Notes&#x201D; text field that is editable even after the order is placed, which can be used for further communication. The idea is that you spend just a little bit of time to consider whatever scenarios you didn&#x2019;t cover and try to give the user something (just bare minimum, maybe even below that), just to allow them to get by. The idea isn&#x2019;t to provide a solution, but to get something that give the user a choice and that will raise enough feedback so you can plug this into the next iteration of your product.Not having anything may mean that the users will solve their own problem using something else (email, or even just talking directly to one another) and we can&#x2019;t have that*, obviously. * It may sound silly, but in some cases, you literally can&#x2019;t have that. Certain actions need to be logged, authorized and track appropriately for many purposes.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The following quotes (or something very similar) came from our interactions with customers:&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;We paid a lot of money for this hardware, why isn&#x2019;t your database making full use of it?&#x201D;&#xA;&#x201C;The machine is peaking at 100% CPU, the sky is falling, help, NOW!&#x201D;&#xA;&#xA;This is a problem, because I can empathize with both sides. On the one hand, having just put a five or six figure sum into new hardware, it can be depressing to see is &#x201C;going to waste&#x201D;. On the other hand, seeing the system under high load gives you that sinking feeling that the boat is going to overturn at any moment and production will go down.&#xA;Balancing resource consumption is a really hard problem, mostly because we don&#x2019;t have any control over our work intake. We can&#x2019;t control how many requests we accept nor do we control what kind of work is being asked of us. Actually, that isn&#x2019;t true. We could control that, but in most cases, that is a false distinction.&#xA;At some point, RavenDB had a max number of concurrent request limit, and users have hit that in the past. This resulted in angry calls from customers about RavenDB refusing requests. The fact that we did that to maintain the overall health of the system was immaterial. Refusing requests meant that the system (or some portion of it) was down. In those cases, it was actually better, from the customer&#x2019;s perspective, for the whole thing to slow down a bit, as long as there were no errors.&#xA;Inside RavenDB, we attempt to manage our CPU consumption using separation of concerns. First, we have the processing of requests. The assumption is that such requests end up being waited on by an actual human, directly or indirectly, so we process them first, prioritizing them above almost everything else. The only thing that has higher priority is the cluster health and monitoring system, which ensure that all nodes are up, running and in the same state.&#xA;As it turns out, RavenDB have a lot of additional processes internally that can be given a lower priority under load. For example, indexing, which are something that RavenDB runs in the background, are something that we can increase the latency of to give more resources for request processing.&#xA;We have a lot of experience in balancing the overall needs, and I&#x2019;m still not sure that I have a good answer here. The reason for this post is that I just analyzed a dump file where it looked like requests were waiting for indexing to complete, but they were actually starving the indexes from the CPU time that they needed to actually run.&#xA0; The system progressed, but not fast enough for the user to not notice things.&#xA;Actually, that is the primary criteria that we use. If the system is slow, but no one notices, the system ain&#x2019;t slow.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When I wrote the first version of RavenDB, I was coming off about six years of intensive work on NHibernate. I wanted the same level of convenience that I had with a world class OR/M with non of the relational constraints (pun intended).Given that I was working in a managed language, features such as change tracking, unit of work, etc. Since then, we created clients for: C#, Java, Python, Node.JS, Ruby and Go. A common feature of all these languages is that they all have automatic memory management. Go, in particular, has been interesting, because while it deals with explicit pointers, there is no need to deal with manually freeing memory. We are now looking at what it would take to bring the same level of experience to a C&#x2B;&#x2B; client.

Now, it is possible that C&#x2B;&#x2B; developers like working at this level. And certainly, the RavenDB client APIs actually have user exposed layers that are similar to this, but this is something that you&#x2019;ll usually not need. Ideally, I want to be able to give the same level of experience to the C&#x2B;&#x2B; client as well. The issue of JSON serialization actually seems to be already well taken for already.&#xA0; A user will need to define to_json and from_json functions to make this work, but given that C&#x2B;&#x2B; has no reflection, that seems reasonable to request. It also gives the user complete control over the serialization / deserialization process and avoid the process of &#x201C;customizing&#x201D; the JSON serialization, which you sometimes have to do. The issue of memory ownership, though, it a bit more complex. I was thinking about exposing this via the following interface:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just had a discussion with a colleague about a fix of non trivial code. The question was what comments should go into the code to explain what was going on.&#xA0; If you care to know, this related to the prefetching strategy that is used by RavenDB to reduce the amount of I/O that is required (especially on slow disks). The details don&#x2019;t actually matter. The problem is that there are multiple relatively complex issues there, from managing I/O to thread safety in the critical code path (using dirty reads intentionally), etc.The problem with doing this is that the code is complex but it is a fairly straightforward progress from the kind of code we usually write in performance sensitive sections. The fear was by over commenting the code, we&#x2019;ll get ourselves into a situation where we&#x2019;ll be making the code too malleable to change. This is the kind of code that sits in the perf critical section, you change it after fasting for a day or two (with strong encouragement on meditation about little vs. big endian and why half endian is so rare). In other words, in practice. You change it when you have reason, and you back up that change with a battery of performance tests. Anything from the usual benchmarks to running production loads on various machines to poring over system traces. Given the amount of effort that is expected from any changes to this code, I consider it to be a good idea for people who read it to understand that there is a hurdle there that must be jumped before it should be modified. Thus, we decided to skip some of the comments on the reasoning behind the overall design. Here is the most important comment in this code, this is there to explain a particular choice of value and the reasoning that must be applied when it is changed.What about the whole complexity of the prefetching in general? That isn&#x2019;t document in code, because reading code comments scattered throughout will make it very hard to grok. This is detailed in the architecture guide that go over these details.For myself, I find it really awesome to go over a codebase and figure out what reasoning lie behind the code. But when I have people working on my projects? It is better to give them a hand than a riddle.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Federico is the go to guy we have for all our performance issues, he talks about a lot of our challenges in this talk.Micro-optimizations at the RavenDB vNext storage engine are critical to achieve 50K&#x2B; write requests per second on single node commodity hardware. In this talk we&#x27;ll explore the use of the new hardware intrinsic introduced on CoreCLR 2.1 in the context of real-life critical path bottlenecks. We will touch on hardcore topics like CPU architecture and its effect on instruction latency and throughput, the effect of cache behaviors (hit/miss ratio, poisoning), prefetching, etc. The talk is aimed at engineers doing micro-optimization and high performance computing.</p>
