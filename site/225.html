            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was busy working on the implementation on filtering in graph queries, as discussed in my previous post. What I ended up implementing is a way for the user to tell us exactly how to handle the results. The actual query we ended up with is this:And the key part here is the where clause, were we state that a and c cannot be the same dog. This also matches the behavior of SQL, and for that reason allow (predictably), that&#x2019;s a good idea.However, I didn&#x2019;t just implement inequity, I implement full filtering capabilities, and you can access anything in the result. Which means that this query is now also possible:I&#x2019;ll let you a moment to analyze this query in peace. Try to de-chyper it (pun intended).What this&#xA0; query is doing is to compare the actual sale price and the regular price of product on a particular order, for products that match a particular set of categories. This is a significant query because, for the first time in RavenDB, you have the ability to perform such a query (previous, you would have had to define a specific index for this query). In other words, what graph query filtering brings to the table is joins. And I did not set out to build this feature and I&#x2019;m feeling very strange about it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB is pretty big, it is over 600,000 lines of C# code and over 220,000 lines of TypeScript code. In a codebase that large, there are unexpected interactions between different components (written by us, third parties and even the operating systems we use). Given how important the stability of RavenDB is, we spend quite a bit of time (as in, the majority of it) not writing new features, but ensuring that the system is stable, predictable and observable. One part of that is a large suite of tests, which are being run on a variety of machines and conditions.Some of these tests fail, in which case we fix them. A failing test is wonderful, because it tell us that something is wrong. A predictably failing test is a pleasure, because it states, in an unambiguous terms, what is going on and what the trouble is. I love getting a failing test, there is usually a pretty straightforward way to figure out what went wrong and then to actually fixing it. Then there are tests that fail occasionally, and I really hate them. They almost always relate to some sort of race condition. Sometimes, the race is in the test itself, but sometimes the problem is in the actual code. The problem is that tracking down such an issue is pretty hard and annoying. The more frequently can we induce the failure, the faster we can actually get to resolving it.We recently had a test that failed, very rarely, and only on Linux.The debugging landscape* on Linux is dramatically poorer compare to Windows, so that adds another hurdle.* Yes, we have JetBrains&#x2019; Rider, and it is great. But it is still quite far from the debugging capabilities of Visual Studio, especially for non trivial debugging. The test failed because of a timeout waiting for a cluster to fully disseminate changes between all the members in the cluster. That means that we had a test that would spin up three to five independent nodes, combine them into a cluster, create a database that is shared among all these nodes, write documents to one of the nodes and then validate that the document is indeed on all the nodes.&#xA0; A failure there, and a timeout failure in that aspect, means that we have to inspect pretty much the whole system.Luckily, we had some good people on this issue, and they manage to come up with a minimal reproduction of the issue. All it took was to spin up a TcpListener and TcpClient and have them talk to one another, then do the same using SSL. We got some really interesting results because of that.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Windows&#xA;Linux&#xA;Diff&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Single Threaded &#x2013; Plain &#xA;192.8200.8104%&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Single Threaded &#x2013; SSL&#xA;5,762.3667,549.811,584%&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Concurrent (200) &#x2013; Plain&#xA;11,377.5932,487.98,195%&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Concurrent (200) &#x2013; SSL&#xA;145,494.8 35,283,175.3 24,250%&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, there is a minor discrepancy in the performance of TCP connection times. All the tests were run on the same machine, testing over localhost.We opened an issue for this problem, and for now we deal with it by accepting that the connection time can be very long and adjusted the timeout for the test.</p>

That is pretty cool, I&#x2019;ll admit, getting Rhinos to dance at all is nice, and in 4D is probably nicer. I wasn&#x2019;t aware that FancyDoodad had this feature at all. Great tidbit and something to discuss over lunch or coffee.The problem is that the follow up was something in the order: &#x201C;Now I wonder how we can use FancyDoodad&#x2019;s cool feature for us. Do you think it can solve the balance issue for this problem?&#x201D; Well, this problem has nothing to do with Rhinos, wildlife, dancing or (hopefully) dimensional math. So while I can see that if you had a burning enough desire and only a hammer, you would be able to use FancyDoodad to try to solve this thing, I don&#x2019;t see the point.The fact that something is cool doesn&#x2019;t meant that it is :Useful.Ought to go into our codebase.Solve our actual problem.So broaden your horizons as much as possible, learn as much as you can ingest. But remember that every thing starts at negative hundred points, and coolness on its own doesn&#x2019;t affect that math.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We run into an interesting design issue when building graph queries for RavenDB. The problem statement is fairly easy. Should a document be allowed to be bound to multiple aliases in the query results, or just one? However, without context, the problem statement in not meaningful, so let&#x2019;s talk about what the actual problem is. Consider the graph on the right. We have three documents, Arava, Oscar and Phoebe and the following edges: Arava Likes OscarPhoebe Likes OscarWe now run the following query:This query asks for a a dog that likes another dog that is liked by a dog. Another way to express the same sentiment (indeed, how RavenDB actually considers this type of query) is to write it as follows:When processing the and expression, we require that documents that match to the same alias will be the same. Given the graph that we execute this on, what would you consider the right result?Right now, we have the first option, in which a document can be match to multiple different alias in the same result, which would lead to the following results:Note that in this case, the first and last entries match A and C to the same document.The second option is to ensure that a document can only be bound to a single alias in the result, which would remove the duplicate results above and give us only:Note that in either case, position matters, and the minimum number of results this query will generate is two, because we need to consider different starting points for the pattern match on the graph.What do you think should we do in such a case? Are there reasons to want this behavior or that and should it be something that the user select?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I used to be a consultant for a long while, and that meant that I worked on a lot of customer projects. That led to me seeing and acting is some really strange ways. Sometimes you go into a codebase and you can&#x2019;t really believe what you see there. I think that this is similar to how an archeologist feels, seeing just remnants of something and having to deduct what were the forces that drove the people who built it. In some cases, what looks like bad code is actually a reaction to a bad policy that people are trying to workaround. I think that the strangest of these cases was when I was working for a customer that refused to let external consultants to use their internal source control system. Apparently, they had sensitive stuff there that they couldn&#x2019;t isolate or something like that. They were using either Team Foundation Server or Visual Source Safe and I didn&#x2019;t really want to use that source control anyway, so I didn&#x2019;t push. I did worry about source control, so we had a shared directory being used as a Subversion repository, this was over a decade ago, mind.So far, so good, and nothing really interesting to talk about. What killed me was that their operations team flat out refused to back up the Subversion folder. That folder was hosted on shared server that belong to the consulting company (but resided at the customer site), and they were unwilling to either back up a &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; computer or to provide us with a shared space to host Subversion that they would back up.For a while, I would backup the Subversion repository every few days to my iPod, then take a copy of the entire source code history with me home. That wasn&#x2019;t sustainable, and I was deeply concerned about the future of the project over time, so I also added a twist. As part of the build process, we packed the entire source directory of the codebase as an embedded resource into the binary. In this way, if the code was ever lost, which I considered to be a real possibility, I would have a way to recover it all back.After we handed off the project, I believe they moved the source to their own repository, so we never actually needed that, but I slept a lot better knowing that I had a second string in my bow.What is your craziest story?</p>

Looking at their history, we have:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;BranchLast CommitNumber of commits this yearv1.0Feb 3, 20130v2.0Oct 14, 20160v2.5Oct 18, 201814v3.0Aug 14, 201810v3.5Oct 11, 201845v4.0Oct 18, 20182,270v4.1Oct 18, 20183,214v4.2Oct 18, 201895&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The numbers are actually really interesting. Branches v1.0 and v2.0 are legacy and not longer supported. Branch v2.5 is also legacy, but we have a few customers with support contracts that are still using it so there are still minor bug fixes going on there occasionally. Most of the people on the 3.x line are using 3.5, which is now in maintenance mode, so you can see that there are very little work on the v3.0 branch and a bit of ongoing bug fixes for customers.The bulk of the work is on the 4.x line. We released v4.0 in Feb of this year, and then switch to working on v4.1, which was released a couple of months ago. We actively started working on v4.2 this month. We are going to close down the v4.0 branch for new features at the end of this month and move it too to maintenance mode. In practical terms, we very rarely need to do cross major version work but we do have a lot of prev, current, next parallel work. In other words, the situation right now is that a bug fix has to go to at least v4.1 and v4.2 and usually to v4.0 as well. We have been dealing with several different ways to handle this task.For v4.0 and v4.1 work, which went on in parallel for most of this year, we had the developers submit two pull requests for their changes, one for v4.0 and one for v4.1. This increased the amount of work each change took, but the cost was usually just a few minutes at PR submission time, since we could usually get cherry pick the relevant changes and be done with it. The reason we did it this way is to avoid big merges as we move work between actively worked on branches. That would require having someone dedicated just to handle that, and it was easier to do it in line, rather than in a big bang fashion.For the v4.2 branch, we are experimenting with something else. Most of the work is going on in the v4.1 branch at this point, mostly minor features and updates, while the v4.2 branch is experimenting with much larger scope of changes. It doesn&#x2019;t make sense to ask the team to send three PRs, and we are going to close down v4.0 this month anyway. What we are currently doing is designating a person that is in charge of merging the v4.1 changes to v4.2 on a regular basis. So far, we are still pretty close and there hasn&#x2019;t been a big amount of changes. Depending on how it goes, we&#x2019;ll keep doing the dual PR once v4.0 is retired from active status or see if the merges can keep going on.For feature branches, the situation is more straightforward. We typically ask the owner of the feature to rebase on a regular basis on top of whatever the baseline is, and the responsibility to do that is on them.A long feature branch for us can last up to a month or so, but we had a few that took 3 months when it was a big change. I tend to really dislike those and we are trying to get them to a much shorter timeframes. Most of the work doesn&#x2019;t happen in a feature branch, we&#x2019;ll accept partial solutions (if they don&#x2019;t impact anything else) and we tend to collaborate a lot more closely on code that is already merged rather than in independent branches.</p>
