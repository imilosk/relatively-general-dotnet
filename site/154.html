        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been writing software at this point for over twenty years, and I want to believe that I have learned a few things during that timeframe. And yet, probably the hardest thing for me is to start writing from scratch. If there is no code already there, it is all too easy to get lost in the details and not actually be able to get anywhere.An empty source file is full of so many options, and any decision that I&#x2019;ll make is going to have very long lasting impact. Sometimes I look at the keyboard and just freeze, unable to proceed because I know, with a 100% certainty, that whatever I&#x2019;ll produce isn&#x2019;t going to be up to my own standards. In fact, it is going to suck, for sure.I think that about 90% of the things I have written so far are stuff that I couldn&#x2019;t write today. Not because I lack the knowledge, but because I have far greater understanding of the problem space and I know that trying to solve it all is such a big task that it is not possible for me to do so. What I need reminding, sometimes, is that I have written those things, and eventually, those things were able to accomplish all that was required of them.A painter doesn&#x2019;t just start by throwing paint on canvas, and a building doesn&#x2019;t grow up by people putting bricks where they feel like. In pretty much any profession, you need to iterate several times to get things actually done. With painters, you&#x2019;ll typically do a drawing before actually putting paint on canvas. With architects will build a small scale model, etc. For me, the hardest thing to do when I&#x2019;m building something new is to actually allow myself to write it out as is. That means, lay out the general structure of the code, and ignore all the other stuff that you must have in order to get to real production worthy code. This means flat our ignoring:Error handlingControl of allocations and memory usedSelect the underlying data structures and algorithmsYes, that means that O(N^2) is just fine for nowLogging, monitoring and visibilityCommenting and refactoring the code for maintainability over timeAll of these are important, but I literally can&#x2019;t pay these taxes and build something new in the same time. I like to think about the way I work as old style rendering passes. When I&#x2019;m done with the overall structure, I&#x2019;ll go back and add these details. Sometimes that can be a lot of work, but at that point, I actually have something to help me. At a minimum, I have tests that verify that things still work and now I have a good understanding of the problem (and my solution) so I can approach things without having so many unknown to deal with.A large part of that is that the fact that I didn&#x2019;t pay any of the taxes for development. This usually means that the new thing is basically a ball of mud, but it is a small ball of mud, which means that if I need to change things around, I have to touch fewer moving parts. A lot fewer, actually. That allow me to explore, figure out what works and doesn&#x2019;t.It is also going directly against all of my instincts and can be really annoying. I really want to do a certain piece of code properly, but focusing on perfecting a single door knob means that the whole structure will never see the light of day.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Graph queries as I discussed them so far gives you the ability to search for patterns. On the right, you can see the family tree of the royal family of Great Britain going back a few hundred years. That make for an interesting subject for practicing graph queries. A good example we might want to ask is who is the royal grand parent of Elizabeth II. We can do that using:This is great, and nicely demonstrate how we can scan for specific patterns in the graph. However, it is limited by its rigidity. For example, let&#x2019;s say that I want to find someone in the family tree and I&#x2019;m not sure about the exact nature of the relationship? &#x201C;We are not amused&#x201D; comes to mind, but off the top of my head and without consulting the chart, I don&#x2019;t think that I would be able to figure it out. Luckily, I don&#x2019;t have to, I can ask RavenDB to be so kind and tell me. Note the use of the recursive element here. We are asking RavenDB to start in a particular document and go up the parents, trying to find an unamused royal. The recursion portion of the query can be zero to six steps in size and should abort as soon as we have any match. Following the zero to six parents, there should be a parent that is both a royal an unamused.The Cypher syntax for what they call variable length queries is reminiscent of regular expressions, and I don&#x2019;t mean that in a complimentary manner. Looking at the query above, you might have noticed that there is a distinct difference between it and the first one. The recursive query will go up the Parents link, regardless of whatever that parent is royal or not. RavenDB Graph Queries has what I believe to be a unique feature. The recursive pattern isn&#x2019;t limited to a single step and can be as complex as you like. For example, let&#x2019;s ensure that we are only going to go up the chain of the royal parents.The recursive element has a few knows that you can tweak. The minimum and maximum distance, for example, are obvious examples, but the results criteria for the recursion is also interesting. In this query, we use the shortest, instead of the lazy. This will make RavenDB work a bit harder and find the shortest recursive path that matches the query, where as lazy stops on the first one that matches. The following options are available:Lazy &#x2013; stop on the first pattern that matches. Good for: &#x201C;Am I related to Victoria?&#x201D;Shortest &#x2013; find the shortest path that match the pattern. Good for: &#x201C;How am I related to Victoria?&#x201D;Longest &#x2013; find the longest path that match the pattern. Good for: &#x201C;For how many generations has Victoria&#x2019;s family been royals?&#x201D;All &#x2013; find all the paths that match the pattern. Good for if you have multiple paths in your ancestry to Victoria.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In my previous post, I discussed some options for changing the syntax of graph queries in RavenDB from Cypher to be more in line with the rest of the RavenDB Query Language. We have now completed that part and can see the real impact it has on the overall design.In one of the design review, one of the devs (who have built non trivial applications using Neo4J) complained that the syntax is now much longer. Here are the before and after queries to compare:The key, from my perspective, is that the new form is more explicit and easier to read after the fact. Queries tend to grow more complex over time, and they are being read a lot more often than written). As such, I absolutely want to lean toward being readable over being terse.The example above just show the extra characters that you need to write. Let&#x2019;s talk about something that is a bit more complex:Now we have a lot more text, but it is a lot easier to understand what is going on. Focus especially on the Lines edge, where we can very clearly separate what constitute the selection on the edge, the filter on the edge and what is the property that contains the actual linked document id.The end result is that we now have a syntax that is a lot more consistent and approachable. There are other benefits, but I&#x2019;ll show them off in the next post. A major source of annoyance for me with this syntax was how to allow anonymous aliases. In the Cypher syntax we used, you could do something like:There is a problem with how to express this kind of syntax of anonymous aliases with the Collection as alias mode. I initially tried to make it work by saying that we&#x2019;ll look at the rest of the query and figure it out. But that just felt wrong. I didn&#x2019;t like this inconsistency. I want a parse tree that I can look at in isolation and know what is going on. Simplifying the language is something that pays dividends over time, so I eventually decided that the query above will look this with the next syntax:There is a lot of precedence of using underscore as the &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care&#x201D; marker, so that works nice and resolves any ambiguities in the syntax.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When we started building support for graph queries inside RavenDB, we looked at what is the state of the market in this regard. There seems to be two major options: Cypher and Gremlins. Gremlins is basically a fluent interface that represent a specific graph pattern while Cypher is a more abstract manner to represent the graph query. I don&#x2019;t like Gremlins, and it doesn&#x2019;t fit into the model we have for RQL, so we went for the Cypher syntax. Note the distinction between went for Cypher and went for Cypher syntax.&#xA;One of the major requirements that we have is fitting in into the pre-existing Raven Query Language, but the first concern we had was just getting started and getting some idea about our actual scenarios. We are now at the point where we have written a bunch of graph queries and got a lot more experience in how it mesh into the overall environment. And at this point, I can really feel that there is an issue in meshing Cypher syntax into RQL. They don&#x2019;t feel the same at all. There are a lot of good ideas there, make no mistake, but we want to create something that would flow as a cohesive whole.&#xA;Let&#x2019;s look at some of our queries and how we can better express them. The one I talked to about the most is this:&#xA;&#xA;Let see what we have here:&#xA;&#xA;match is the overall clause that apply a graph pattern query to the dataset.&#xA;() &#x2013; is an indication of a node in the graph.&#xA;[] &#x2013; is an indication of an edge.&#xA;a:Dogs, l:Likes and b:Dogs &#x2013; this is an alias and a path specification.&#xA;-[]-&gt; &#x2013; is an indication of an edge between two nodes&#xA;(expression) &#x2013; is a filter on a node or an edge&#xA;&#xA;I&#x2019;m ignoring the select statement here because it is just the usual RQL select statement.&#xA;The first thing that keeps biting us is the filter in (a:Dogs (id() = &#x27;dogs/arava&#x27;)), I keep being tripped by missing the closing ), so that has got to go. Luckily, is it very obvious what to do here:&#xA;&#xA;We use an explicit where clause, instead of the () to express the inline filter. This fits a lot more closely with how the rest of RQL works.&#xA;Now, let&#x2019;s look at the aliases: (b:Dogs). The alias:Collection syntax is pretty foreign to RQL, we tend to use the Collection as alias syntax. Let&#x2019;s see how that would look like, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;This looks a lot more natural to me, and it is a good fit into RQL in general. This syntax does bring a few things to the table. In particular, look a the edge. In Cypher, an anonymous edge would be: [:Likes], and using this method, we will have just [Likes].&#xA;However, as nice as this syntax is, we still run into a problem. The query above is actually just a shorthand way to write the full query, which looks like so:&#xA;&#xA;In fact, we have two queries here, to show off the actual problem we have in parsing. In the first case, we have a match clause the only refers to explicit with statement. On the second case, we have a couple of explicit with statements, but also an implicit with edges expression (the Likes).&#xA;From the point of view of the parser, we can&#x2019;t distinguish those two. Now, we can absolutely say that if the edge expression contains a single name, we&#x2019;ll simply look for an edge with that name and otherwise assume that this is the path that will be used.&#xA;But this seems to be error prone, because you might have a small typo or remove a edge statement and get a completely different (and unexpected) meaning. I thought about adding some sort of prefix to help tell an alias from an implicit definition, but that looks very ugly, see:&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;And on the other hand, I really like the &#x2013;[Likes]-&gt; syntax in general. It is a lot cleaner and easier to read.&#xA;At this point, I don&#x2019;t have a solution for this. I think we&#x2019;ll go with the mode in which we can&#x2019;t tell what the query is meant to say just from the parser, and look at the explicit with statements to figure it out (with the potential for mistakes that I pointed out earlier) until we can figure out something better.&#xA;One thing that I&#x2019;m thinking about is that the () and [] which help distinguish between nodes and edges, aren&#x2019;t actually required for us if we have an explicit statement. So we can write it like so:&#xA;&#xA;In this manner, we can tell, quite easily, if you meant to define an implicit edge / node or refers to an explicitly defined alias. I&#x2019;m not sure whatever this would be a good idea, though.&#xA;Another issue we have to deal with is:&#xA;&#xA;Note that in this case, we have a filter expression on the edge as well. Applying the same process we have done so far, we get:&#xA;&#xA;The advantages here is that this is very clear and obvious about what is going on. The disadvantage is that this takes quite a bit longer to express.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">An interesting challenge with implementing graph queries is that you sometimes get into situations where the correct behavior is counter intuitive. Consider the case of the graph on the right and the following query:This will return:Source: Arava, Destination: OscarBut what would be the value of the Edge property? The answer to that is&#x2026; complicated.&#xA0; What we actually return is the edge itself. Let&#x2019;s see what I mean by that.And, indeed, the value of Edge in this query is going to be dogs/oscar.This isn&#x2019;t very helpful if we are talking about a simple edge like this. After all, we can deduce this from the Src &#x2013;&gt; Destination pair. This gets more interesting when the edge is more complex. Consider the following query:What do you this should be the output here? In this case, the edge isn&#x2019;t the Product property, it is the specific line that match the filter on the edge. Here is what the result looks like:As you can imagine, knowing exactly what edge led you from one document to another can be very useful when you look at the query results.</p>
