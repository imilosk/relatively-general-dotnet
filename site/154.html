        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We run into an interesting design issue when building graph queries for RavenDB. The problem statement is fairly easy. Should a document be allowed to be bound to multiple aliases in the query results, or just one? However, without context, the problem statement in not meaningful, so let&#x2019;s talk about what the actual problem is. Consider the graph on the right. We have three documents, Arava, Oscar and Phoebe and the following edges: Arava Likes OscarPhoebe Likes OscarWe now run the following query:This query asks for a a dog that likes another dog that is liked by a dog. Another way to express the same sentiment (indeed, how RavenDB actually considers this type of query) is to write it as follows:When processing the and expression, we require that documents that match to the same alias will be the same. Given the graph that we execute this on, what would you consider the right result?Right now, we have the first option, in which a document can be match to multiple different alias in the same result, which would lead to the following results:Note that in this case, the first and last entries match A and C to the same document.The second option is to ensure that a document can only be bound to a single alias in the result, which would remove the duplicate results above and give us only:Note that in either case, position matters, and the minimum number of results this query will generate is two, because we need to consider different starting points for the pattern match on the graph.What do you think should we do in such a case? Are there reasons to want this behavior or that and should it be something that the user select?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I used to be a consultant for a long while, and that meant that I worked on a lot of customer projects. That led to me seeing and acting is some really strange ways. Sometimes you go into a codebase and you can&#x2019;t really believe what you see there. I think that this is similar to how an archeologist feels, seeing just remnants of something and having to deduct what were the forces that drove the people who built it. In some cases, what looks like bad code is actually a reaction to a bad policy that people are trying to workaround. I think that the strangest of these cases was when I was working for a customer that refused to let external consultants to use their internal source control system. Apparently, they had sensitive stuff there that they couldn&#x2019;t isolate or something like that. They were using either Team Foundation Server or Visual Source Safe and I didn&#x2019;t really want to use that source control anyway, so I didn&#x2019;t push. I did worry about source control, so we had a shared directory being used as a Subversion repository, this was over a decade ago, mind.So far, so good, and nothing really interesting to talk about. What killed me was that their operations team flat out refused to back up the Subversion folder. That folder was hosted on shared server that belong to the consulting company (but resided at the customer site), and they were unwilling to either back up a &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; computer or to provide us with a shared space to host Subversion that they would back up.For a while, I would backup the Subversion repository every few days to my iPod, then take a copy of the entire source code history with me home. That wasn&#x2019;t sustainable, and I was deeply concerned about the future of the project over time, so I also added a twist. As part of the build process, we packed the entire source directory of the codebase as an embedded resource into the binary. In this way, if the code was ever lost, which I considered to be a real possibility, I would have a way to recover it all back.After we handed off the project, I believe they moved the source to their own repository, so we never actually needed that, but I slept a lot better knowing that I had a second string in my bow.What is your craziest story?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As I&#x2019;m writing this, we have the following branches in the main repository of RavenDB. Looking at their history, we have:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;BranchLast CommitNumber of commits this yearv1.0Feb 3, 20130v2.0Oct 14, 20160v2.5Oct 18, 201814v3.0Aug 14, 201810v3.5Oct 11, 201845v4.0Oct 18, 20182,270v4.1Oct 18, 20183,214v4.2Oct 18, 201895&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The numbers are actually really interesting. Branches v1.0 and v2.0 are legacy and not longer supported. Branch v2.5 is also legacy, but we have a few customers with support contracts that are still using it so there are still minor bug fixes going on there occasionally. Most of the people on the 3.x line are using 3.5, which is now in maintenance mode, so you can see that there are very little work on the v3.0 branch and a bit of ongoing bug fixes for customers.The bulk of the work is on the 4.x line. We released v4.0 in Feb of this year, and then switch to working on v4.1, which was released a couple of months ago. We actively started working on v4.2 this month. We are going to close down the v4.0 branch for new features at the end of this month and move it too to maintenance mode. In practical terms, we very rarely need to do cross major version work but we do have a lot of prev, current, next parallel work. In other words, the situation right now is that a bug fix has to go to at least v4.1 and v4.2 and usually to v4.0 as well. We have been dealing with several different ways to handle this task.For v4.0 and v4.1 work, which went on in parallel for most of this year, we had the developers submit two pull requests for their changes, one for v4.0 and one for v4.1. This increased the amount of work each change took, but the cost was usually just a few minutes at PR submission time, since we could usually get cherry pick the relevant changes and be done with it. The reason we did it this way is to avoid big merges as we move work between actively worked on branches. That would require having someone dedicated just to handle that, and it was easier to do it in line, rather than in a big bang fashion.For the v4.2 branch, we are experimenting with something else. Most of the work is going on in the v4.1 branch at this point, mostly minor features and updates, while the v4.2 branch is experimenting with much larger scope of changes. It doesn&#x2019;t make sense to ask the team to send three PRs, and we are going to close down v4.0 this month anyway. What we are currently doing is designating a person that is in charge of merging the v4.1 changes to v4.2 on a regular basis. So far, we are still pretty close and there hasn&#x2019;t been a big amount of changes. Depending on how it goes, we&#x2019;ll keep doing the dual PR once v4.0 is retired from active status or see if the merges can keep going on.For feature branches, the situation is more straightforward. We typically ask the owner of the feature to rebase on a regular basis on top of whatever the baseline is, and the responsibility to do that is on them.A long feature branch for us can last up to a month or so, but we had a few that took 3 months when it was a big change. I tend to really dislike those and we are trying to get them to a much shorter timeframes. Most of the work doesn&#x2019;t happen in a feature branch, we&#x2019;ll accept partial solutions (if they don&#x2019;t impact anything else) and we tend to collaborate a lot more closely on code that is already merged rather than in independent branches.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Regardless of the operating system you use, you are going to get roughly the same services from each of them. In particular, process and memory isolation, managing the hardware, etc. It can sometimes be really interesting to see the difference between the operating systems approach to solving the same problem. Case in point, how both Windows and Linux manage memory. Both of them run on the same hardware and do roughly the same thing. But they have very different styles, this end up having profound implications on the application using them.Consider what appears to be a very simple question, what stuff do I have in my RAM? Linux keeps track of Resident Set Size on a per mapping basis, which means that we are able to figure out how much of a mmap file is actually in memory. Further more, we can figure out how of the mmap data is clean, which means that it is easily discardable and how much is dirty and needs to be written to disk. Linux exposes this information via the /proc/[pid]/smapsOn the other hand, Windows doesn&#x2019;t seem to bother to do this tracking. You can get this information, but you need to ask it for each page individually. This means that it isn&#x2019;t feasible to check what percentage of the system memory is clean (mmap pages that hasn&#x2019;t been modified and can be cheaply discarded). Windows expose this via the QueryWorkingSetEx method.As a result, we have to be more conservative on Windows when the system reports high memory usage. We know that our usage pattern means that high amount of memory in use (coming from mmap clean pages) is fine. It is a small detail, but it has caused us to have to jump through several hurdles when we are running under load. I guess that Windows doesn&#x2019;t need this information, so it isn&#x2019;t exposed, while on Linux it seems to be used by plenty of callers.</p>
