            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Kelly Sommers had this twit, that caught my attention.   While half a minute pause is not something that we have really seen, we have seen production systems that spend a lot of their cycles on GC. That is better than a pause, but only in the same way that you prefer to stab your toe rather than break your leg. As per the title of this post, the most challenging tasks in a database engine isn&#x2019;t actually how to fetch the data, or how it is stored, but the management of the various resources that are available. In particular, CPU utilization, memory usage and I/O. Most databases handle I/O pretty much from the get go, because it is such a painful topic. And it is relatively easy and obvious to see how you need to handle CPU allocations. But memory is tricky. It is tricky because you typically want to share as much of it as possible, to reduce memory usage, except you don&#x2019;t, because of thread safety and &#x201C;is someone still using that?&#x201D; issues. The GC is a really great invention in this regard, because you can offload all of this behavior (well, not the thread safety one, but deciding when to throw stuff out can also be hard) to a well tested component and pretty much forget about it. That would be a mistake. See Kelly&#x2019;s post above for the reasons why. By not managing memory yourself, you are letting a standard component, which you have no control over, take over a critical part of your system. With potentially dramatic results.  But we need to distinguish between different types of memory here. Modern GCs are typically using some notion of generations (Gen0, Gen1, Gen2) and are really good in collecting memory that isn&#x2019;t held for long. The major problem is when you have memory that is retained for a long period of time (thus pushed to Gen1, Gen2), which caused the problems. The good thing about a managed language and the GC is that you can write trivially simple code, and it would typically run at a faster speed than a similarly trivially simple native code. A good experiment on that is Raymond Chen&#x2019;s dictionary series, notice Rico&#x2019;s analysis there. The solution is to take active control on that, and make clear distinctions between the different types of memory. Being able to have cheap allocations&#xA0; for short term objects (such as handling of a request) is a great productivity boost, but the database needs to know that anything that is either large or potentially long living cannot really be treated as standard managed objects. The database needs to allocate them by itself, preferably in the native heap, and manage that directly. Once you do that, the actual managed memory you&#x2019;ll use is almost all in the context of handling requests / other short term operations, and any GC collections will only impact that request (typically at the end of it).  Most managed databases are headed in that direction, and for a good reason.  As for RavenDB, see the previous posts I had recently.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most important things that you need to do for high performance is to control your allocations. Indeed, the blittable format is almost entirely implemented in unmanaged memory. And we get a great deal of performance from not having the GC poke its annoying little nose into our data structures. That said, it means that we take the onus of managing the memory ourselves.&#xA;This post is about a couple of changes that we made to the memory management system in the blittable format, and some future directions we intend to explore.&#xA;The first thing that we did was to implement an unmanaged memory pool based on ConcurrentDictionary&lt;int, ConcurrentStack&lt;IntPtr&gt;&gt;. The int is the size (in power of two) of the allocated blocks. And we would allocate from the heap, and then store the buffers internally for reuse. That worked, but profiling showed that we had quite a bit of work in just leasing and returning the buffers to the thread safe pool.&#xA;Note that this was when we only tested using a single thread, we expect that the cost of working with it would only increase when using multiple threads.&#xA;That sucked.&#xA;Luckily, we use the context pattern for pretty much everything in blittable format (and more generally in RavenDB), so we can take advantage of that. We have a three stages process.&#xA;First, we allocate the memory when we first request it. Then, when we are done using it, we return it to the context, not the global pool. This allows us to avoid cross thread coordination costs entirely. And it is quite common for threads to need to run the same buffers multiple times, so we save the &#x201C;check in the buffer&#x201D; just to &#x201C;lease me this buffer again, please&#x201D; style of work.&#xA;Here are the costs when using a single shared, thread safe pool:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, we spent quite a bit of time just managing the thread safe collections. You don&#x2019;t see it in this profile, but other profiling sessions show the concurrent dictionary under load as well. And this is in a single threaded, no contention benchmark.&#xA;We moved the memory allocations to the context. Because a context is single treaded, we can rely on much simpler (and cheaper) collections, and we can also reuse contexts. A request checks out a context, which has its own cached buffers. It runs through the request, then return the context as a whole to the buffer. Each of those contexts can then manage their own memory and only rarely need to go to the global pool. There is some complexity about making sure that overly fat contexts hang around, but that is basically it.&#xA;And when we need to release the data from the context, we can do all of that in a single bulk operation. Here are the profiler results after:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I admit, it is a bit disappointing to see only a 100% improvement, but I can comfort myself with knowing that the saving in multi threaded scenarios are much higher.&#xA;I mentioned that we also have some ideas on improving this furhter. This idea (which we deferred right now because there are other more important things to do) include just allocating a big buffer (128MB in size) per context. We&#x27;ll not commit all of it, merely reserve the address space, and start allocating from it directly. Basically, each allocation would simply be a pointer increment (with occational calls to commit the rest of the reserved address space).&#xA;Now, in order to free the memory, all we need would be to reset the position to zero, and we are set to reuse the context again at effectively zero cost. If this sounds familiar to you, this is because this is primarily how allocations actually work in .NET, except that we explicitly control the size and the lifetime of all the objects in there.&#xA;It also has no cost in GC, which is quite nice. As I said, we are thinking about this, but at this point, I think that we are fast enough that we don&#x27;t need to go there yet. We&#x27;ll have to see under concurrent usage what this will be.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This series of posts is continuting the work I have outlined in this series. While in the previous series, I focused on the overall picture, here I want to talk about the small things we did to speedup pretty much every aspect of the system. In some cases, those are order of magnitude differences.&#xA;In this post, I want to talk about the following:&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;Oren\r\nEini&#x201D;&#xA;&#xA;Such a simple thing,&#xA0;if you just look at the surface, and yet if you&#x2019;ll profile the Json.NET code, you&#x2019;ll see an interesting issue. I took an existing JSON file (about 67MB in size) and continiously wrote it to /dev/null under a profiler. The results are actually quite surprising.&#xA;&#xA;In fact, this is a bit worse.&#xA;&#xA;dotTrace has a great feature that allows you to remove &#x201C;noise&#x201D; from a trace. Here is what happens if we eliminate this call:&#xA;&#xA;So, pretty obivously, this is an really expensive call. But how expensive is it, really? Note that this profiling run used a Null Stream, so there isn&#x2019;t any I/O cost to consider. This is the pure computational cost of calling this method.&#xA;Let us look at a deeper profiling profiler of this method:&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, WriteEscapedString does about 9% of work, then call WriteEscapedJavaScriptString, which make some calls to the StreamWriter. But about 33% of the time is spend doing its own thing, looking at the code, it is clear what is going on:&#xA;&#xA;Basically, before it can write anything, this code needs to go over the string and find out if it has any escape characters. If it does, it needs write the escape sequence, then resume writing the string. This means that this code has to scan the string that it is writing several times, and much worse, it means that you can&#x2019;t really do justice with those operations. Consider the string above, writing it out is actually several different calls to the writer. In fact, we have:&#xA;&#xA;&#x201C;&#xA;Oren&#xA;\r&#xA;\n&#xA;Eini&#xA;&#x201C;&#xA;&#xA;The problem here is that we lose a very powerful feature, the ability to batch multiple operations into a single I/O call. Sure, the TextWriter is going to be doing a bit of buffering for us, but that doesn&#x2019;t help us really. Let us consider one of the most important calls we have in this code:&#xA;&#xA;For the string above, we call this method twice, once for each portion of the string that isn&#x2019;t escaped. That means that argument validation needs to run each and every time. And we also have to copy the memory in itsy bitsy pieces. Memory copy routines can get far greater speed if they can copy a large bunch of memory all at once, rather than being called on small sections of it.&#xA;In short, I hope that this convinced you that escaping strings is expensive. Stupidly so, when you come right down to it.&#xA;But what can you do, that is the cost of doing business, right?&#xA;Indeed, JSON.Net code is heavily optimized, and there isn&#x2019;t much you can do about improving things at this point. You are stuck with the JSON format and the implications of it.&#xA;This is already a long post, but bear with me while I explain the reasoning.&#xA;The blittable format isn&#x2019;t JSON. We read JSON and output JSON, but we aren&#x2019;t limited to the same constraints as someone who is just consuming JSON. There are two separate use cases for the document using the blittable format. The first is when we need to work with them on the server side. This include such things as indexing, transformers, patching, etc. For those cases, if there is an escaped value, we need to get the unescaped version. In other words, I need the string with the line break in it, not the \r\n escape sequences. The other common use case, unfortunately, is when we need to write the document to the user, in which case we do need to write it out with all of the escape sequences.&#xA;What is left for us, apparently, is to choose our poision. We can optimize for either scenario, but not for both.&#xA;Except, that maybe we can. And that is what we actually did.&#xA;When we write a string value into the blittable format, we read escape sequences, and translate them into their unescaped values. In other words, we take a &#x201C;\n&#x201D; and store just the byte 13. But we also remember its position. The string we keep talking about? It would be stored as:&#xA;[10][O][r][e][n][10][13][E][i][n][i][2][4][0]&#xA;The first byte (10), is the length of the string. Then we have the actual unescaped version. If the server side code wants to read this string, we can just serve it directly from this memory, without any additional work. But what about when we need to write it down, and maintain the escape sequences? That is where the numbers in the end come into play. We need to skip 10 bytes past the length, where we&#x2019;ll encounter 3 bytes: 2, 4, 0.&#xA;The first byte is the number of escape sequences in the string. The second is the number of bytes that we can copy until we get to the next escape sequence. Which means that our code for writing string has narrowed down to:&#xA;&#xA;And that, in turn, means that if you don&#x2019;t have any escape sequences, we can just call memcpy directly to write to the output buffer. And if you do have escape sequences, we just need to scan the escaped characters, we don&#x2019;t need to scan the entire string.&#xA;There is so much saving in the air, it feels like Black Friday.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Unlike previous posts in this series, this is actually something that happened to our own production server today. It resulted in our website being inaccessible for a a couple of hours, and like most such stories, its root cause is tremedously simple, and through a series of unfortunate accidents, it had escalated to a major issue. First, this post is dedicted to this book, which should be read by any self respecting developer whose code is expected to hit production.  This post is also written a few hours only after the incident was resolved. Before we actually implemented anything except a temporary workaround. I&#x2019;ll probably have another post in a couple of days to talk about the steps we are going to take to alleviate a repeat of this incident. The incident started innocently enough, when one of the guys on the team discovered that the startup time of a certain instance jumped by a lot. Investigating into why he realized that the issue was extremely slow responses from our server. That was a cause of triple concern, actually. First, why are we accepting such slow responses instead of time limiting them? Second, why are we making a remote syncronous call during startup? And third, why on Earth is our server so slow? Logging into the server, it didn&#x2019;t take long to see what the problem was. The www.RavenDB.net website (the code that runs the RavenDB website, not RavenDB itself) was consuming a lot of CPU and quite a bit of memory. In a bit to restore the other services which reside on the same box, we reset the process. Our main concern at the time was to restore service as soon as possible, and we planned on investigating further through the logs. However, in a few minutes, the www.RavenDB.net website started consuming more and more resources. At that point, we started considering a DoS attach of some sort and looked a the logs. The logs did show a very high number of requests, much more than I would expect. But looking further into them, it looked like they were mostly bots of various kinds indexing our site.  Considering that this might be the case of Google hammering us, we configured a robots.txt on the site and waited to see if this would have an impact. It didn&#x2019;t.  The next step was to take a process dump of the process, and then analyze it. During this period, we had to shut down www.RavenDB.net because it was killing all other services running on the server. Looking at the dump in WinDBG, we started with the obvious commands.  !runaway &#x2013; to find out the thread cpu times switching to the busiest threads !clrstack - to see what it is doing Honestly, this is a much nicer way of looking at this, though:  As you can see, the threads are currently actually doing parsing of a Razor template, and seems to be doing that on a fairly continous basis, consuming all system resources. At that point, I started getting concerned to the well being of the poor guy&#x2019;s inbox as a result of this code. That was the point where we actually did what should have probably been our first action, and looked at the error log of the website.  Previously, we looked at the live metrics and the request log, but didn&#x2019;t consider looking into the error log for the system. The error log for the website, for today only, was 6GB in size, and was pretty full of errors such as:   - error: (221, 88) &#x27;HibernatingRhinos.Orders.Common.EmailProcessing.EmailTemplates.RavenDBWebsite.Models.DownloadQuestionMailInput&#x27; does not contain a definition for &#x27;Unsubscribe&#x27; and no extension method &#x27;Unsubscribe&#x27; accepting a first argument of type And at that point, we had enough to point a suspicious finger. We have an email that we send out, and we used to have a valid template. At some point, the code was changed and the Unsubscribe was removed. Nothing broke because the template is just a file, not actually compiling code. However, in production, when we tried to send the email, Razor would parse the text, fail compilation because of the missing member, and basically thorw a hissy fit.  Update: We investigated further, and it looks like the following was the actual &#x201C;solution&#x201D; to the outage:  The &#x201C;solution&#x201D; is in quotes, becasue this fixes the problem, but we need to still implement steps to ensure that something like that doesn&#x2019;t repeat. Unforuntately, at that point, we would consider this email as failing, and move on to the next one. That next one would also fail, and so would the next one, etc. Because all of them failed, they would get picked up again next time this run.   Once we knew where the problem was. The workaround was to deploy a version with no email sending. For this weekend, that will work. But come Sunday, someone is going to go over this piece of code with a veyr fine comb. I&#x2019;ll post more about it once this actually roll around.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After quite a bit of work, we have finished (at least for now) the Blittable format. As you can probably guess from the previous posts, we have decided to also implement small string compression in the Blittable format, based on the Smaz algorithm.  We also noticed that there are two distinct use cases for the Blittable format. The first is when we actually want to end up with the document on disk. In this case, we would like to trade CPU time for I/O time (especially since usually we write once, but read a lot, so we&#x27;ll keep paying that I/O cost). But there are also many cases in which we read JSON from the network jus to do something with it. For example, if we are going to read an index definition (which is sent as a JSON document), there is no need to compress it, we&#x27;ll just have to immediately uncompress it again. So we added the option to choose what mode you&#x27;ll use the data. Here are the benchmarks for speed and size for Json, Blittable (for disk) and Blittable (for memory) &#xA0; As expected, we see a major difference in performance between Blit to disk and Blit to mem. Blit to mem is comparable or better from Json in nearly all scenarios, while Blit to disk is significantly smaller than Json while having comparable or better performance at parsing time, even though it is compressing a lot of the data. For large documents, this is even more impressive: &#xA0; Blit to mem is 40% &#x2013; 75% of the speed of Json at parsing, while Blit to disk can be much more expensive (us to x2.5 times more than Json), depending on how compressible the data is. On the other hand, Blit to mem is already smaller than Json in 33% &#x2013; 20% for most datasets, but Blit to disk improves on that significantly, often by as much as 60% of the original JSON. In the companies.json case, the original file size is 67.25 MB, using Blit to mem we have a 45.29 MB file, and using Blit to disk gives us a 40.97MB.  This is a huge reduction in size (compared to appreciable fraction of a second on most I/O systems). So far, we look at the big boys, but what happens if we try this on a large number of small documents? For example, as would commonly happen during indexing? In this case, we see the following:  Note that Blit to disk is very expensive in this mode, this is because we actually do a lot. See the next chart:  Blit to disk is actually compressing the data by close to 20MB, and it is 5 MB smaller than Blit to memory. The question on what exactly is the difference between Blit to memory and Blit to disk came up in our internal mailing list. The actual format is identical, there are currently only two differences:  Blit to disk will try to compress all strings as much as possible, to reduce I/O. This is often at the cost of parsing time. Blit to mem just store the strings as is, which is much faster, obviously. It takes more memory, but we generally have a lot of that available, and when using Blit to memory, we typically work with small documents, anyway. Blit to disk also does additional validations (for example, that a double value is a valid double), while Blit to memory skip those. The assumption is that if the double value isn&#x2019;t valid, it will fail when you actually access the double&#x2019;s value, whereas we want to have such issues happen when we persist the data if we are actually going to access it later when using Blit to disk. Overall, a pretty good job all around.</p>

I&#x2019;ve been consistently applying DDD principles in my projects for about 6 years now and I can&#x2019;t express enough how much value Domain-Driven Design has brought to me. The blue book&#xA0;written by Eric Evans was the most influential book I&#x2019;ve ever read in&#xA0;my career.&#xA; If you read this book too, you must have noticed that while it provides invaluable insights, it doesn&#x2019;t tell much about how to implement them in practice.</p>
