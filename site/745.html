            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Apparently I am suffering from the Bug Duplication Syndrom. Shortly after posting about cascading drop downs in MonoRail, I realized that I have actually duplicated a bug that I have run into while using the cascading drop down extender in the ASP.Net Ajax toolkit. That is not a fixable bug, btw, and has to do with what happens when you have more than a single parent. You can see my post about this scenario&#xA0;here, but be aware that the solution in that post is vulnerable to race conditions, and I have finally declared that unpracticle to use. At any rate, I have duplicate the inability to have multiply parents in my previous solution using MonoRail. And I decided that instead of fixing it in place, I&#x27;ll show the steps neccesary to fix the problem. Basically, we want to update both the secondaries select and the tertiaries select, which means that our GetSecondaryProfressionsByPrimary.brailjs will now contains:   page.Replace( &#x27;secondaries&#x27;, &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Form.Select(&#x27;secondaries&#x27;,SecondaryProfessions, &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {@value: @Id, @text: @Name, @firstoption: res.Select})&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; )page.Replace( &#x27;tertiaries&#x27;, &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Form.Select(&#x27;tertiaries&#x27;,TertiaryProfessions, &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {@value: @Id, @text: @Name, @firstoption: res.Select})&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; )page.Call( @hookSecondariesChangeEvent ); And that the GetSecondaryProfressionsByPrimary action is now: public void GetSecondaryProfressionsByPrimary(Guid id)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;SecondaryProfessions&quot;] =&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;professionRepository.FindSecondariesByPrimaryIdOrAll(id);&#xA;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;TertiaryProfessions&quot;] =&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;professionRepository.FindTertiariesByPrimaryIdOrAll(id);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;Oh, and that was it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just had this need, and I decided to explore what I could do without referring to what other people has already done. There are probably better ways, but this one has tickled my fancy. Anyway, the idea here is to display three levels of hierarchy in a profression. Here is the HTML: &lt;table&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;${res.PrimaryProfession}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;${Form.Select(&quot;primaries&quot;,PrimaryProfessions,                                 {@value: @Id, @text: @Name, @firstoption: res.Select}) }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;${res.SecondaryProfession}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;${Form.Select(&quot;secondaries&quot;,SecondaryProfessions,                                  {@value: @Id, @text: @Name, @firstoption: res.Select}) }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;${res.TertiaryProfession}&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;${Form.Select(&quot;tertiaries&quot;,TertiaryProfessions,                                  {@value: @Id, @text: @Name, @firstoption: res.Select}) }&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&#xA;This is not very fancy, and the CSS guys would be all over me for using a table, but let us leave that aside. Basically, we render three select elements. Now, let us see the server side, shall we?&#xA;public void Index()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;PrimaryProfessions&quot;] =&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;professionRepository.FindAllPrimaries();&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;SecondaryProfessions&quot;] =&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;professionRepository.FindAllSecondaries();&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;TertiaryProfessions&quot;] =&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;professionRepository.FindAllTertiaries();&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;The ProfressionRepository uses Repository&lt;T&gt; internally, I want to avoid using Repository&lt;T&gt; directly in my controllers. Now, we need to actually respond to change events on the client side:&#xA;$j(document).ready(function()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;$j(&#x27;#primaries&#x27;).change(function()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;$j.ajax({ &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;url:&#x27;GetSecondaryProfressionsByPrimary.ashx&#x27;,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;data: { id: $j(&#x27;#primaries&#x27;).val() },&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;dataType: &#x27;script&#x27;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;});&#xA;&#x9;});&#xA;&#x9;hookSecondariesChangeEvent();&#xA;});&#xA;&#xA;function hookSecondariesChangeEvent()&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;$j(&#x27;#secondaries&#x27;).change(function()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;$j.ajax({ &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;url:&#x27;GetTertiaryProfressionsBySecondary.ashx&#x27;,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;data: { id: $j(&#x27;#secondaries&#x27;).val() },&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;dataType: &#x27;script&#x27;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;});&#xA;&#x9;});&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is done using jQuery, to hook the events and issue Ajax requests to the server when they are done. Note that I am registering the seconderies change event in a separate function, it will be soon clear why.&#xA;Now, how does the server handles this?&#xA;public void GetSecondaryProfressionsByPrimary(Guid id)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;SecondaryProfessions&quot;] =&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;professionRepository.FindSecondariesByPrimaryIdOrAll(id);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public void GetTertiaryProfressionsBySecondary(Guid id)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;TertiaryProfessions&quot;] =&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;professionRepository.FindTertiariesBySecondaryIdOrAll(id);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;So we just pass the parameters to the repository, which does all the work for us, in this case, getting the children if the id is valid, or all if it isn&#x27;t. Now let us move to the relevant views, shall we? We are using BrailJS here, so here is GetSecondaryProfressionsByPrimary.brailjs:&#xA;page.Replace( &#x27;secondaries&#x27;, &#xA;&#x9;Form.Select(&#x27;secondaries&#x27;,SecondaryProfessions, &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{@value: @Id, @text: @Name, @firstoption: res.Select})&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;)&#xA;page.Call( @hookSecondariesChangeEvent );&#xA;As you can see, I ask the page to replace the element secondaries with the newly rendered select element. I then acll the hookSecondariesChangeEvent function, since I actually replace the entire element, and not just its content. I am doing this because I don&#x27;t feel like extracting the part that renders just the options from the Form.Select() method, but I will probably will the next time I need it.&#xA;The GetTertiaryProfressionsBySecondary.brailjs is actually simpler:&#xA;page.Replace( &#x27;tertiaries&#x27;, &#xA;&#x9;Form.Select(&#x27;tertiaries&#x27;,TertiaryProfessions, &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{@value: @Id, @text: @Name, @firstoption: res.Select})&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;)&#xA;Again, there are probably betters way, but this is the one I just came up with.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Colin Ramsay&#xA0;has a post titled Abandon ALT.NET&#xA0;which I want to respond to. Here is the first interesting quote:  Just as I find it pointless that you&#x2019;d go to a conference to discuss the stuff that everyone there already knows. DDD, BDD, MVC - these aren&#x2019;t things that will be unknown to people attending the ALT.NET conference.   ALT.NETter A: so&#x2026; heard of that new BDD business?ALT.NETter B: Yep.ALT.NETter A: Oh, well there&#x2019;s this great new idea called DDD!ALT.NETter B: Yeah, right into that too.ALT.NETter A: Oh. And so on. But wouldn&#x2019;t that conversation have been a whole lot more interesting if the second developer hadn&#x2019;t heard of those ideas? I am eating myself up because I wasn&#x27;t able to go. Because those are the kind of discussions that I would really like to have. Not to be in a comforting echo chamber where all my ideas are confirmed, but because then I can continue the discussion forward, and say:  ALT.NETer B: So, we are using DDD in this scenario, and we have run into conflicts between...ALT.NETer A: Hm, I think that I have an idea, do you have a laptop so we can discuss this over code? When you are on a level plain field, then you can start advancing. That is important, and a reason enough for the conference as it is. But while that compromise a significant percentage of the people that were in the conference, it is by no mean all of them. And that certainly wasn&#x27;t the main topic of discussion.   And in order to address that imbalance, the ALT.NET mob organise an enormous desert circle-jerk, and I call bullshit. If they really wanted to change things then they should be writing about their techniques in detail, coming up with introductory guides to DDD, TDD, mocking, creating screencasts, or giving talks at mainstream conferences, or producing tools to make the level of entry to these technologies lower than it is. Um, I thought we were doing that? From Jeremy Miller&#x27;s WinForm Design Patterns to your own screen casts to Scott Bellware talking in DevTeach about BDD to building efficient tools. I don&#x27;t think that this is a fair statement to say, frankly.</p>

If you don&#x27;t, you are stupid, a Mort, or, god forbid, an architect.&#xA0; Oh my, I am not sure if this was intended to be amusing, but I certainly find it so.  Similarly, it is okay to use a Visual Studio designer.&#xA0; It is even okay to use drag and drop.&#xA0; There, I said it.&#xA0; Let me say it again, with feeling: IT IS OKAY TO USE DRAG AND DROP.&#xA0; This comes at a very appropriate time, since I just spent a few hours wresting with a drag &amp; drop code-gen solution. I got it to work, even. But the end result is not what I want or need, so I am going to rewrite it by hand tomorrow. So there, it is perfectly OK to use Drag &amp; Drop, and I would probably never do anything in WinForms without the designer. And just a note about the Alt.NET Agilistas, I am afraid that this term is reserved for Wendy and Oxana.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">It is rare that I get to the foint where I am just flat out speechless from seeing something. Today I went beyond that, I was flat out speechless and aghast.  The image that you see here is a small part of the FilteredAccount view in Micorosft CRM. Yes, you got that right, a small part. I got to this from experimenting with the DB model, trying to figure out how things work. I was strongly adviced not to make any use of any sort of view that started with Filtered. &quot;It would make you cry&quot;, they said, &quot;don&#x27;t say we didn&#x27;t warn you&quot;. I took a peek inside, to see what all the fuss was about. I disagree with Microsoft of quite a few subjects, but they usually manage to hit the target, even if that target is on a completely wrong continent as far as I am concerned. Some background, before we continue. Filtered Views in MS CRM are used to show the user just the data that they are supposed to see, according to role based permissions. Using the connected usernmae as the way to filter the view.  As a result of that, all the members of the organization has connect access to the CRM DB, and can just open&#xA0;query analyzer and start executing queries against the DB. An immediate result of that is that you need to start managing security at the DB level, since those views will not be very good if you can just query the underlying tables. I gues it would not suprise anyone that I have serious issues with this model, but let us put this aside for a moment. I have issues with this model, but they are manageable ones. Anyway, using the filtered views is the only supported way of handling accessing the database directly, mostly meant for reports. I think that you can guess how efficent it is going to query&#xA0;a filtered view, right? I counted, the FilteredAccount view has:  5&#xA0;row level functions 40 outer joins 2 subqueries At this point, I am considering creating the DETD - Developers for Etichal Treatment of Databases. Surely this is cruel and unusal behavior to put this burden on an unsuspecting database. And I am pretty sure that it is a violation of the Geneva Convention to inflict such a thing on your unsuspecting users. Left forever wonderring when that query will ever return...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into the issue of having to alert the user of some error, and it brought home the fact that English &amp; Hebrew are not easy to mix. In fact, code such as this is consider a very bad sign, usually code that you don&#x27;t really want to touch, see or believe in:   So, we need some sort of a way to externalize those strings, even if the only language that this application is going to use is Hebrew, simply because of the pain of mixing the two together. After thinking about it for a while, I decided to create this view (JavascriptResources/index.brail): &lt;%&#xA;for de in controller.Resources:&#xA;&#x9;resourceName = de.Key&#xA;%&gt;&#xA;&#x9;var ${resourceName} = {&#xA;&#x9;&lt;% for item in GetParameter(resourceName): %&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;${item.Key}: &#x27;${item.Value.Replace(&quot;&#x27;&quot;,&quot;\\&#x27;&quot;) }&#x27;,&#xA;&#x9;&lt;% end %&gt;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Empty: &#x27;&#x27;&#xA;&#x9;};&#xA;&lt;%&#xA;end&#xA;%&gt;&#xA;And here is the definition of the controller:&#xA;[Resource(&quot;Processes&quot;, &quot;MyApp.Resources.Javascript.Processes&quot;)]&#xA;[Resource(&quot;Errors&quot;, &quot;MyApp.Resources.Javascript.Errors&quot;)]&#xA;[Resource(&quot;Messages&quot;, &quot;MyApp.Resources.Javascript.Messages&quot;)]&#xA;public class JavascriptResourcesController : Controller&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public void Index()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;But what the hell does this do, anyway? Not much, actually, but it will iterate over all the registered resources for the controller, and output something that looks like this for each of those resources:&#xA;var Processes = {&#xA; &#x9;EmploymentType: &#x27;Employment Type&#x27;,&#xA;&#x9;Details: &#x27;Details&#x27;,&#xA;&#x9;Dates: &#x27;The dates&#x27;,&#xA;&#x9;Empty: &#x27;&#x27;&#xA;};&#xA;The nice thing is that I can now write: alert(Errors.RecursiveError);*. As a side affect (as I said, the application is just in Hebrew so I don&#x27;t care about that much), I also get the usual benefits of localization.&#xA;* You have to read Hebrew to get the joke, I am afraid.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note, this is a partial (and the final) response to Sam Gentile post about ALT.NET. Now to the part that actually talks about ATL.NET:  ALT.NET is a divisive thing. No matter what they tell you, they are full of negative energy, they sneer at others that don&#x27;t buy into their view and sneer at the &quot;enterprisey&quot; folks. ALT.NET is divisive, of course. Like any idea, it divide people into those who agree and those who don&#x27;t. The ALT.NET doesn&#x27;t include a value statement about those who don&#x27;t agree, I am feeling forced to point out. And I am not sure that I know how to sneer, as a matter of fact. Perhaps I need to start taking lessons. I believe that I stated before that I believe in the option of respectfully disagreeing with someone. Me &amp; Roy often end up there, so I know that this is possible. Viewing ALT.NET as a movement about rejection is a mistake, it is about accepting more options, about keeping your mind open. The underlying issue is that like all people, I am lazy, and as such, I would really like to be able to just use the off the shelf, standard stuff. Unfortunately, I have found that fairly often, that doesn&#x27;t do what I want, and to make it do what I want would be more costly than doing it from scratch. As you can imagine, that came as a shock. At first I dealt with it with denial, there is no way this can be, that is what everyone is using, no way that it has this problem, obviously I am missing something. I went and did my research, and discovered that indeed, everyone who tried to do what I wanted run into the same problem, and had to solve it using the same wahonie shaped solution. That was the reluctant compliance stage, a lot of people stay there. Finally I accepted that this is indeed a problem, and I set out to find other means to achieve my goals. They were not standards when I started, but they certainly moving in that direction for a while now. ALT.NET, in my view, is about accepting that there are better ways to do things, and you should go and find them if your current way is painful. Don&#x27;t miss the last part, it is important. I hope that I am practical, and good enough solution is just that. If the current way you are doing things is not painful, there is no reason to change anything. If it is painful, then accept the fact that there are other ways and find them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Note, this is a partial response to Sam Gentile post about ALT.NET.&#xA;&#xA;One of the things that Sam said that I fully agree on is this one:&#xA;&#xA;...walking into a Fortune 50 bank with 200 systems, using 20 different technologies, totally non-integrated, and listening to the business needs and using solution technologies like BizTalk, Neuron, WCF, MOSS, Sharepoint and such putting together a solution that requires me to have intimate knowledge of the business as well as single sign on, multi-domain security trust domains, asynschronous message brokering and lots more&#xA;&#xA;Solving this kind of problems is non trivial and requires understand both tech and business issues. There aren&#x27;t a lot of problems like this, however. In fact, most of the problems that I am dealing with aren&#x27;t at all similar. Which leads me to the parts that I don&#x27;t agree with:&#xA;&#xA;It comes from that community&#x27;s&#xA0;[ALT.NET]&#xA0;inability to see beyond the code level, something I refer to being constantly in &quot;the weeds.&quot; They refuse to work on back-end systems as beneath them, everything &quot;enterprisey&quot; is beneath them. Being in the weeds means you only look at everything as code and can only see code.&#xA;&#xA;No, actually, it does not. If I can solve something easier using capabilities of BizTalk out of the box, I will use that. Hell, I am using BizTalk in my current project, precisely because of that, it makes talking to non reliable sources fairly easy, so I don&#x27;t have to write this code. BizTalk is not enterprisey, but a lot of the solutions that utilize it are.&#xA;There is a reason that I don&#x27;t like to hear about web services, ESB, etc. I understand and even approve the basic ideas, I don&#x27;t like what happens when those ideas are turn into buzz-wards. The problem then is that you start the process of understanding the problem with &quot;Assume that we have an ESB...&quot;, simply because this is the thing to do right now.&#xA;Sam calls my approach &quot;being in the weeds&quot; (I don&#x27;t agree, but let us get to this in a minute), the other side for that is the Architect in the White Shiny Tower, handing Architecture to the masses.&#xA;Now, let us get to the &quot;being in the weeds&quot; and &quot;refuse to work on back-end systems as beneath them&quot;. My statement to this is simply:&#xA;&#xA;I will refuse to work on a back end system if using it will make my life harder than using another system/library or rolling your own, period.&#xA;&#xA;SSIS comes to mind very clearly in this regard. It is not a blind refusal, it is an educated one, based on (painful) experience. Yes, I do have a prejudice against big back end systems, that came from seeing all the enterprisey solutions that where built on that. After seeing so much time going down the drain making a back end system behave the way you want (which I would have think was the natural way to handle), and comparing it to the amount of effort that it would take to just do it on my own...&#xA;I believe that I have a good basis to my prejudice. That doesn&#x27;t mean that I will roll such systems completely, but that I will evaluate each case independently. &#xA;What Sam calls being in the weeds I call confidence. I am confident that I know what I am doing, that I understand both the business requirements and the technical ones, and I am capable of solving the problem without taking a preconceived dependency on a back-end system.&#xA;The problem with the approach that Sam depends is that it is too often so high you never sees any of the details, ending in an enterprisey result. One too complex for the job required, and costing more than it should. I never worked with Sam, so I have no idea about how he actually work, so keep in mind, this is not about Sam. It is about seeing and hearing about quite a few designs that are totally wahonie shaped, just to fit a preconceived notion of how Things Ought To Be.&#xA;And that is the approach that I would reject.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A while ago I commented&#xA0;on Alex&#x27;s data-layer componentization idea. Alex replied, and Diego as well, but I didn&#x27;t get around to answering them until now. To remind you, the basic idea is:   A data-layer component simply allows for information to be shared between different applications.  By supporting re-use data layer componentization allows you to break the duplication habit. You can still have silos, but the natural tendency to duplicate data disappears. Each new silo will instead contain only new types of data and where old types are required, simply pointers, or cross silo foreign keys. I am going to get to answering their points in a bit, but one thing that I do agree on is the idea of a DataServer, to quote Alex:  I like to think of this as a DataServer as opposed to a Database. The idea being that a DataServer is the place you go to get data in the shape that makes sense for you (i.e. the conceptual model), and is responsible for getting that data from one or more data-sources or databases on your behalf. Except that I see this in an entirely different light. I don&#x27;t like the idea of distributing the data over many sources, I would much rather pull all this information to my own DB, and shift the problem from downed application to stale data. That can be a problem, but that depends on the application at hand. See the end of the post about my ideas of this, for now, I want to get to Alex&#x27;s points. I mentioned that taking dependencies on several databases cause a server decrease in the reliability of the system, any of them going down will cause the entire system to go down:  Of course systems with multiple dependencies are less robust, but the alternative opens you up to relying on out of date or incorrect data, which hardly seems any better?  It really depends on the application at hand, most business application can work with stale data without much problem, and recovering from that isn&#x27;t really a problem. But it is far less common to find a scenario where possibly stale answer is better than a downed application.  Another point that I raised was that changing a single application can ripple to all the other applications in the organization.  This is essentially the dual schema problem n&#x2019;est pas? So you handle it the same way you always handle the dual schema problem, with an intermediary conceptual model. Incidentally there is no reason you have to have only one conceptual model for any given data model either. If one application changes and another doesn&#x27;t create a different conceptual model. That is actually the N&#x27;th Schema problem. I am nervous about making changes to one application just because another have changed, much less N other applications. Shotgun Surgery in a grand level. Even if we assume that we need to merely update the mapping layer, I have had enough problems with that to cause me to call it simple or painless. And if we are talking about a change that affect the conceptual model as well, this gets even more interesting. Another concern was about business logic that is required to actual do something with the data. Using this data server approach, you need the business logic to make sense of the data, and if this business logic change in the original application, what happens to the rest of the applications?  I&#x2019;m not claiming that the ability to share data-layers suddenly negates the need for a business layer! In fact by sharing data-layers it finally becomes possible to share business layers. That is what Base4 tried to do, it was after all a client/server ORM. I am not seeing how you can share a business layer from multiply application in a single application. You can build a web service that would get the data, already processed, but that is not sharing the business layer from another application, that is accessing that other application for the data. I mentioned security as well, row and column level security that is bounded by business rules, Alex gave much the same answer for this as well, and I have the same answer, I can&#x27;t see it working after the first change. Cross databases FK:  Until relational databases matured I am sure the management of standard FK&#x2019;s was tricky too, we need to recognize that we are the age of distribution, all the data necessary often can&#x2019;t be in one place, it is an interconnected world and we need to understand this. This is why we need data-servers not just databases. Nevertheless, this doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. And trying to do cross DB FKs is a painful performance issue, with no real good answers. That leads well into the problem of performance when you need to pull the data from disparate sources:  Yes doing joins across databases is likely to be slow, but using this performance issue, to say it shouldn&#x27;t be done is a little like saying downloading a movie from the internet takes a long time,&#xA0; so we should never do it. I don&#x27;t care if it takes a long time, I want to see the damn movie! That is fine and good, but saying that you don&#x27;t care about performance stops when you realize that you have to send the result back to the client in 500ms or less. There were few to none movie downloads in the 90s, because download speed and cost made it impractical in the extreme. Only when it got to the point where you could download a movie fairly easily is started to be really popular. There are two kinds of performance problems, the small that you don&#x27;t care about in advance (calling the DB in a loop is a favorite of mine) and the architectural ones that you really want to at least consider ahead of time. Calling external resources is right there on the top of the list as far as I am concerned. If in order to serve a request I need to make 5 requests by design, then I am going to think it really hard before I go on. It is simply not the place I want to start with.  Just because something has issues, doesn&#x2019;t mean it isn&#x2019;t useful. I am not claiming that data layer componentization solves every problem; rather that it is a very nice trick to have in the arsenal. No argument here, I certainly think that Alex has a lot of merit here, I am trying to point out the other side. I don&#x27;t think that this is something that is quite relevant yet. Alex then went own to point the flaws in my own preferred approach, bringing all the data into the application&#x27;s DB using some sort of an ETL process:  For example Ayende&#x27;s preferred route of using an ETL process to create local copies.  More often than not developers don&#x27;t actually know that there is another database that has the information they need or simply don&#x27;t bother with an ETL process anyway. Often times every database thinks it is the master, and the natural result is no database can be trusted. Sometimes It is just not practical to duplicate all data, sometimes there is just too much, or sometimes the cost of transfer is too high, or it takes too long to do it, or you can&#x27;t tolerate dirty data, or you have too many places to copy that data. In order to avoid (2), unwieldy and error prone &#x2018;human&#x2019; processes need to develop, people need to remember to go into 2, 3, 6, 15 (?) systems to keep everything in sync. To answer the points in order:  If they don&#x27;t know there is another DB, how would they access the data at the first place. I find it hard to believe that a developer will think &quot;Hm, I guess I need the customer data, let us just invent one&quot; Defining who is the master of the data is often critical, absolutely. Master-Master merging can be a PITA of a high order. I can usually copy parts of the data, or do diffs, to decrease the cost of moving the data. The point about stale data is a very good one, I&#x27;ll answer it in the end of this post. I don&#x27;t think so, in order to avoid the master/master problem you need to define who the master is, and how you go about updating that piece of the data. &#xA0; Diego&#x27;s post is a more thorough analysis of why taking the ETL approach to the extreme is not a good idea. He focus on the cost of making a change to the system after it was deployed, specifically, what happen when you have N ETL processes that needs to be modified as a result of a schema change? The cheeky answer to that, have the ETL work of the conceptual schema, at which point you have a single place to go and modify, the ETL processes.  But no, I don&#x27;t think that I would recommend this approach for all the systems in an organization, assuming N systems that needs each other information, you would have NxN processes, and that is problematic.  So, what is my view of the data server? Well, let us start by removing the data, and then the server. I have said it before, a application database is an implementation detail, you don&#x27;t want outsiders to start pawing over your data. The way I consider it, define a set of web services for each application, that allows external applications to use the data in the application. If you needs BA reports, ETL the data to a reporting database, you are likely to want to that anyway. No, I didn&#x27;t drink the WS koolaid, and I am not really happy that I am suggesting a WS as a &quot;Solution&quot;, but that is just my biases against buzzwards. At its heart, this is the same idea, but with WS instead of data, and with the conceptual schema captured as XML messages. The major difference is that I have more tools at my disposal to work with WS than with databases. Versioning, for one, is something that isn&#x27;t trivial by any means, but it is something that WS does much better than databases.&#xA0;Most of the other concerns are also mitigated by this approach. Business level decisions, be it logic or security, for instance, are enforced by the service, which is part of the application, so changing that would immediately affect everything else.  But, didn&#x27;t I just said that I want to minimize the amount of external dependencies that I have? Doesn&#x27;t it count as the same thing? Yes and no. I wouldn&#x27;t want my application to talk to a dozen services any more than I would want it to talk to a dozen databases. That is where service aggregator come into place. They aggregate related services into a single place. This is the place where I would apply caching, for instance, but not where I would put business logic. This is also a good place to decide what to do about downed service. I can either use a cached value, retry a number of times, try an alternate method, or fail the whole operation. If this looks like an ESB, I am sorry about it, this is not the intention. I view the service aggregator as a way to aggregate the information from disparate sources into a single place. I can certainly see a way to create some framework for this, and rollout an aggregator per application, to meet that application need. Although I think that several core services or core aggregators should do for most of what the applications need to do. And yes, that is not my ideal, but I can&#x27;t really see a way to work with disparate sources without handling this disparity somewhere, so I don&#x27;t see a way around that.</p>
