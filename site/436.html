            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was asked to review NAppUpdate, a simple framework for providing auto-update support to .NET applications, available here. Just for to make things more interesting, the project leader of NAppUpdate is Itamar, who works for Hibernating Rhinos, and we actually use NAppUpdate in the profiler.  I treated it as an implementation detail and never actually looked at it closely before, so this is the first time that I am actually going over the code. On first impression, there is nothing that makes me want to hurl myself to the ocean from a tall cliff:  Let us dig deeper, and almost on the first try, we hit something that I seriously dislike.   Which leads to this: public static class Errors&#xA;{&#xA;    public const string UserAborted = &quot;User aborted&quot;;&#xA;    public const string NoUpdatesFound = &quot;No updates found&quot;;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;And I wouldn&#x2019;t mind that, except that those are used like this:&#xA;&#xA;There are actually quite a lot of issues with this small code sample. To start with, LastestError? Seriously?!&#xA;LatestError evoke strong memories of GetLastError() and all the associated fun with that.&#xA;It doesn&#x2019;t give you the ability to multiple errors, and it is a string, so you can&#x2019;t put an exception into it (more on that later).&#xA;Also, note how this work with the callback and the return code. Both of which have a boolean for success/failure. That is wrong.&#xA;That sort of style was valid for C, but .NET, we actually have exceptions, and they are actually quite a nice way to handle things.&#xA;Worse than that, it means that you have to check the return value, then go the LatestError and check what is going on there, except&#x2026; what happen if there was an actual error?&#xA;&#xA;Note the todo, it is absolutely correct. You really can&#x2019;t just call a ToString() on an exception and get away with it (although I think that you should). There are a lot of exceptions where you would simply won&#x2019;t get the required information. ReflectionException, for example, ask you to look at the LoaderExceptions property, and there are other such things.&#xA;In the same error handling category, this bugs me:&#xA;&#xA;This is an exception that implements the serialization exception, but doesn&#x2019;t have the [Serializable] attribute, which all exceptions should have.&#xA;Moving on, a large part of what NAU does is to check remote source for updates, then apply it. I liked this piece of code:&#xA;public class AppcastReader : IUpdateFeedReader&#xA;{&#xA;    // http://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/ADCdocs/Appcasting&#x2B;RSS&#xA;&#xA;    #region IUpdateFeedReader Members&#xA;&#xA;    public IList&lt;IUpdateTask&gt; Read(string feed)&#xA;    {&#xA;        XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();&#xA;        doc.LoadXml(feed);&#xA;        XmlNodeList nl = doc.SelectNodes(&quot;/rss/channel/item&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;        List&lt;IUpdateTask&gt; ret = new List&lt;IUpdateTask&gt;();&#xA;&#xA;        foreach (XmlNode n in nl)&#xA;        {&#xA;            FileUpdateTask task = new FileUpdateTask();&#xA;            task.Description = n[&quot;description&quot;].InnerText;&#xA;            //task.UpdateTo = n[&quot;enclosure&quot;].Attributes[&quot;url&quot;].Value;&#xA;            task.UpdateTo = n[&quot;enclosure&quot;].Attributes[&quot;url&quot;].Value;&#xA;&#xA;            FileVersionCondition cnd = new FileVersionCondition();&#xA;            cnd.Version = n[&quot;appcast:version&quot;].InnerText;&#xA;            task.UpdateConditions.AddCondition(cnd, BooleanCondition.ConditionType.AND);&#xA;&#xA;            ret.Add(task);&#xA;        }&#xA;&#xA;        return ret;&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;    #endregion&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This is integrating with an external resources, and I like that this is simple to read and understand. I don&#x2019;t have a lot of infrastructure going on in here that I have to deal with just to get what I want done.&#xA;There is a more complex feed reader for an internal format that allows you to use the full option set of NAU, but it is a bit complex (it does a lot more, to be fair), and again, I dislike the error handling there.&#xA;Another thing that bugged me on some level was this code:&#xA;&#xA;The issue, and I admit that this is probably academic, is what happen if the string is large. I try to avoid exposing API that might force users to materialize a large data set in memory. This has implications on the working set, the large object heap, etc.&#xA;Instead, I would probably exposed a TextReader or even a Stream.&#xA;Coming back to the error handling, we have this:&#xA;FileDownloader fd = null;&#xA;if (Uri.IsWellFormedUriString(url, UriKind.Absolute))&#xA;    fd = new FileDownloader(url);&#xA;else if (Uri.IsWellFormedUriString(baseUrl, UriKind.Absolute))&#xA;    fd = new FileDownloader(new Uri(new Uri(baseUrl, UriKind.Absolute), url));&#xA;else if (Uri.IsWellFormedUriString(new Uri(new Uri(baseUrl), url).AbsoluteUri, UriKind.Absolute))&#xA;    fd = new FileDownloader(new Uri(new Uri(baseUrl), url));&#xA;&#xA;if (fd == null)&#xA;    throw new ArgumentException(&quot;The requested URI does not look valid: &quot; &#x2B; url, &quot;url&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;My gripe is with the last line. Instead of doing it like this, I would have created a new Uri and let it throw the error. It is likely that it will have much more accurate error information about the actual reason this Uri isn&#x2019;t valid.&#xA;On the gripping hand, we have this guy:&#xA;&#xA;This is the abstraction that NAU manages, the Prepare() method is called to do all the actual work (downloading files, for example) and Execute() is called when we are done and just want to do the actual update.&#xA;I know that I am harping about this, but this is really important. Take a look at another error handling issue (this is representative of the style of coding inside this particular class) in the RegistryTask:&#xA;&#xA;So, I have an update that is failing at a customer site. What error do I have? How do I know what went wrong?&#xA;Worse, here is another snippet from the FileUpdateTask:&#xA;&#xA;For some things, an exception is thrown, for other, we just return false.&#xA;I can&#x2019;t follow the logic for this, and trying to diagnose issues in production can be&#x2026; challenging. &#xA;In summary, I went through most of the actual important bits of NAppUpdate, and like in most reviews, I focused on the stuff that can be improved. I didn&#x2019;t touch on the stuff it does well, and that is its job.&#xA;We have been using NAppUpdate for the last couple of years, with very few issues. It quite nicely resolves the entire issue of auto updates to the point were in our code, we only need to call a few methods and it takes cares of the entire process for us. &#xA;Major recommendations from this codebase:&#xA;&#xA;Standardize the error handling approach. It is important.&#xA;And even more important, logging is crucial to be able to diagnose issues in the field. NAU should log pretty much everything it does and why it does it. &#xA;This will allow later diagnosal of issues with relative ease, vs. &#x201C;I need you to reproduce this and then break into the debugger&#x201D;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the RavenDB mailing list, we got a question about tagging. In this case, the application need:  1. Tags have identity&#xA0; (&quot;set&quot; has a different meaning if I&#x27;m talking math, music or sports). 2. I want to know who tagged what and when. 2. I want to do this once, as a service, so i don&#x2019;t need have ids in each document i want to tag. In my app, there are many such document types. Let us see how we can approach this in RavenDB. We are going to do it like so:  Note that because tags have identity, we store only the tag id inside the tagged object, along with the required information about who &amp; when it was tagged. Now, let us try to have some fun with this. Let us say that I want to be able to show, given a specific album, all the albums that have any of the same tags as the specified album. We start by defining the following index:  Note that the naming convention matches what we would expect using the default Linq convention, so we can easily query this index using Linq. And now we want to query it, which, assuming that we are starting with albums/1, will look like:  This translate to &#x201C;show me all of the albums that share any of the specified tags, except albums/1&#x201D;. And this is pretty much it, to be fair. Oh, if you want to show the tags names you&#x2019;ll have to include the actual tags documents, but there really isn&#x2019;t anything complex going on. But what about the 3rd requirement?  Well, it isn&#x2019;t really meaningful. You can move this Tags collection to a the layer super type, but if you want to be able to do nice tagging with RavenDB, this is probably the easiest way to go.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">&#x201C;We can confirm that a large number of instances in a single Availability Zone have lost power due to electrical storms in the area,&#x201D; Amazon reported at 8:30 pm Pacific time on Friday the 29th. Among those servers were RavenHQ-web-1 server (responsible for showing the www.RavenHQ.com marketing site) and RavenHQ-DB-1 (responsible for all the databases located on 1.ravenhq.com).  The reason for that is apparently a big storm that hit the&#xA0; US-East-1 region (Virginia data center). The data center lost power (and no generators were up, somehow) for about 30 minutes which caused extended outage for some of our customers. Small comforts, but we were in the same boat as Netflix, Heroku, Pinterest, and Instagram, among others. Before we dig any deeper. No data was lost, and we resumed normal operations within a few hours. Users with replicated plans had no interruption of service. During the outage, we were in the process of bringing up a new node with all of the databases from the impacted servers, but that would have entailed customers having to change connection strings, and the outage was resolved before we got to that point. I want to show you how RavenHQ is architected from a physical stand point. What you can see isn&#x2019;t actually the servers (those are fairly dynamic) but it is enough for you to get the picture.   In particular, both RavenHQ-web-1 and RavenHQ-db-1 were in US-East-1 region, and were impacted by this issue. The good news is that the rest of our servers were located in different availability regions and were not impacted by the issue. In particular, that was a good stress test (which we could have done without, thank you very much, Amazon&#x2019;s non working generators) for our HA scenario. None of the replicated plans customers experienced much of a problem, we had an auto failover to the secondary server (and depending on your plan, if that would have gone down, the failover would go to the tertiary server, etc). We actually have a customer that has a 4 ways master / master replicated plan, so he is super safe . Unfortunately, that means that any customer that wasn&#x2019;t on a replicated plan and was located on a US-East-1 server felt the impact. Unfortunately, that meant a lot of the free plan customers, since those are predominantly located on that region.&#xA0; As well as a number of actual paying customers. We are sorry for that, and we all understand the need to balance between &#x201C;what happen if&#x201D; and &#x201C;what does it cost&#x201D;. As a result, we are going to offer all existing customers a 25% discount for all replicated plans for the next 6 months. Just contact us and ask for an upgrade to the replicated plan, and we will set it up for you. One of the things that we are trying to do in RavenHQ is really commoditize the notion of a database that is just there, and you worry not about it. Going with the replicated plans is probably the best way to go about doing that, since your data is going to live on at least two physically remote servers, and we have auto failover ready to pop in and support your application if there are any issues. That is why we are offering the discount, as a way to make it even more affordable to go into High Availability mode. Speaking of High Availability, I should probably talk about what happened to www.ravenhq.com, and the answer is fairly simple. The cobbler&#x27;s children go barefoot. We spent a lot of time designing and building RavenHQ to be sustainable in the face of outages, but we focused all of our attention into the actual production instances, we didn&#x2019;t really pay any mind to www.ravenhq.com. As far as we are concerned, this is a marketing site, and it was a low priority for HA story. Unfortunately when we actually had an outage, people really freaked out because www.ravenhq.com was down, even though we had the actual database servers up and running, the website being down gave the impression that all of RavenHQ was down, which was decidedly not the case. Lessons learned  We need to encourage customers to go to the replicated plans by default. They are more expensive,yes, but they are also safer.  We need a better process in the case of outages, to move databases from failed nodes to new ones, and inform customers about this change.  More parts of are actual core infrastructure require to be HA. In particular, we need:   To make sure that authentication works when core servers are missing (wasn&#x2019;t a problem in this particular case, but our investigation revealed that it could be, so we need to solve that).  Ensure that www.ravenhq.com is fully replicated.  Create a /status page, where you can look at the status of the various servers and see how they are acting.  The last two are more for peace of mind than any real production need, but any cloud service runs on trust, and we think that adding those would ensure that if there are any problems in the future, we would be able to provide you with better service.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Some things just piss me off. But before I get to what pissed me off this time, let me set the scene. We usually request from candidates applying for a job in Hibernating Rhinos to submit some piece of code that they wrote. They get additional points if their code is an Open Source project. Some people have some&#x2026; issues with the concept. The replies I got were:  I don&#x2019;t know if I can&#x2019;t send you the code, I&#x2019;ll have to ask my employer. (Which seems really silly thing to do, considering you want to get the code to show it to some other company that you want to hire you). Here is the code, but don&#x2019;t tell anyone. (Those usually get deleted immediately after I send them a scathing reply about things like IP and how important it is to respect that). Here is my last course code. (Which is what actually triggered this post). Here is the deal, if you aren&#x2019;t coding for fun, you are not suitable for a developer position in Hibernating Rhinos. Just to give you some idea, currently we have the following pet projects that I am aware of:  Jewish Sacred Books repository &#x2013; display / commentary Jewish Sacred Books repository &#x2013; search / organization (Note that the two are by two different people and are totally unrelated.) Music game app for Android, iOS and WP7 Personal finance app Auto update library for .NET Various OSS projects And probably other stuff that I am not aware of. (Just for the record, those are things that they are working on their own time, not company time. And not because I or anyone else told them). Why is this relevant? Because I keep getting people who think submitting some random piece of code that they have from their latest university course is a good way to show their mad code skillz. I mean, sure, that might do it, but consider carefully what sort of projects you are usually given as part of university courses. They are usually very small, focusing on just one aspect, and they are totally driven by whatever the crazy professor think is a valid coding standard. Usually, that is NOT a good candidate for sending a code to a job interview. I am going to share just one line from a codebase that I recently got: private void doSwap(ref Album io_Album1, ref Album io_Album2)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The code is in C#, in case you are wondering. And you can probably learn a lot about the state of the codebase from just this line of code. Among my chief complaints:&#xA;&#xA;Violating the .NET framework naming guidelines (method name).&#xA;Violating the .NET framework naming guidelines (argument names).&#xA;Swapping parameters, seriously?! What, are you writing your own sort routine? And yeah, the answer is yes.&#xA;When I pinged the author of the code, he replies that this was because of the course requirements. They had a strict polish notation guidelines, and io_ is for a input &amp; output parameter.&#xA;They had other guidelines (you may not use foreach, for example) that explained some strangeness in the codebase.&#xA;But that isn&#x2019;t really the point. I can understand crazy coding standards, what I can&#x2019;t understand is why someone would submit something that would raise so many red flags so quickly as part of a job application process.&#xA;This is wasting everyone&#x2019;s time. And that is quite annoying.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Update: The issue has been resolved, I&#x2019;ll update on Sunday with full details about this. Some RavenHQ customers may have noticed that they are currently unable to access their RavenHQ databases. The underlying reason is an outage in Amazon US-EAST-1 region, which is where the ravenhq.com server and some of the data base servers are located.  Customers with replicated plans should see no disturbance of service, since this should trigger an automatic failover to the secondary node.  If you have any questions / require support, please contact us via our support forum: http://support.ravenhq.com/ You can see the status report from Amazon below. We managed to restore some service, but then lost it again (because of EBS timeouts, I suspect). We are currently hard at work at bringing up new servers in additional availability zones, and we hope to restore full functionality as soon as possible.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you had sharp eyes, you might have noticed that in this code, I am actually using two different sessions:  We have the GeoSession, and we have the RavenSession. The GeoSession is actually pointed at a different database, and it is a read only. In fact, here is how we use this:  As you can see, we create this on as needed basis, and we only dispose it, we never actually call SaveChanges().  So, those are the technical details, but what is the reasoning behind this? Well, it is actually pretty simple. The GeoIP dataset is about 600 MB in size, and mostly it is about&#x2026; well, geo location stuff. It is a very nice feature, but it is a self contained one, and not something that I really care for putting inside my app database. Instead, I have decided to go another way, and use a separate database. That means that we have separation, at the data layer, between the different databases. It makes sense, about the only thing that we need from the GeoIP dataset is the ability to handle queries, and that is expressed only via GetLocationByIp, nothing more. I don&#x2019;t see a reason to make the app database bigger and more complex, or to have to support updates to the GeoIP dataset inside the app. This is a totally separate service. And having this in a separate database make it much easier to use this the next time that I want to use geo location. And it simplify my life right now with regards to maintaining and working with my current app. In fact, we could have taken it even further, and not use RavenDB access to this at all. We can use REST calls to get the data out directly. We have chosen to still use the RavenDB Client, I&#x2019;ll discuss exactly why we chose not to do that.</p>
