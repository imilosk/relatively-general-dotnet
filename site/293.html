        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We spend a lot of time trying to reduce our sync I/O cost with Voron, namely, the actual journal write to the disk. This is very expensive, because we have to hit the actual disk, forgoing any buffering.  So anything that can reduce that cost is a really good idea. We spent some time looking at dynamic compression ratios heuristics, to see if it is worth it. Basically, we tried to figure out which option to use:  The idea is that based on the speed of the hard disk in use, we can decided whatever it is worth it or not to spend more time compressing the journal entry before saving it. We tested a system where the I/O duration would be balanced against compression speed and size, and adjust automatically. It failed, horribly. Basically, even on the fastest drives we could find, it was almost always better to compress at the highest level, because the cost of going to disk is so high. There is another aspect of this, however. The cost of going to disk isn&#x2019;t linear to the size you are writing. I used the example of putting your groceries in the trunk. The fuel cost of the trip is not really going to be dominated by the weight of the groceries. After writing this statement, I fact checked myself. According to Auto Blog, each 100 pounds (50 KG) of added weight will increase the fuel utilization by about 1%. What is going to dominate the cost, however, is how much do you have to drive. In the same manner, writing to the disk is impacted by the amount you write, but writing 4KB or 20KB has roughly the same cost anyway. Writing 2 MB is much longer, but not as much as you would expect. Note that all of those numbers assume no buffering all the way to disk, and using DMA. We then tried to see what happen if we would just avoid compressing small writes. Anything smaller than 64KB is going to be compressed to less than 64KB, but the actual cost of writing to disk isn&#x2019;t going to change, so we can save the compression costs. That actually improved performance a little bit for fast drives, but it hurt us on slow ones.  I had an interesting discussion with Alex on the usage of diff compression in the journal. This can take advantage on the fact that in many cases, we don&#x2019;t modify full pages, so we can write just the changes out to disk. He was kind enough to include a few implementations of that for us to look at, those are RLE0 (Zero Run Length Encoding) implementations, and I&#x2019;ll use RLE to refer to it from now on. Reducing I/O is always good, and this promised to give a substantial boost, but the actual design details that cropped us are really interesting.&#xA0; Diff compression can be simple, like the RLE0 in this link, effectively, outputting something like:   ... [x bytes unchanged][y bytes changed][byte 1 .. y][z bytes unchanged] ... Or they can be much more complex, like bsdiff or xdelta. RLE handles the scenario where some bytes changes nicely, but fails badly if there is a single added byte (since it simply check for equality, we&#x2019;ll see all the bytes are different). Algorithms like bsdiff or xdelta can handle much more complex differences, but they are drastically more expensive. For my purposes, bsdiff has runtime complexity of O( 2N * logN ) and memory utilization of 17N. It other words, to get the diff of 4 pages, we&#x2019;ll need 272KB and about 230K operations. Algorithms like that are usually meant for distributions. In other words, they are meant for cases where you can spend as much time as you want generating the diff, and you benefit from reduced download times. A modern usage of those is the Courgette&#xA0; project, for reducing the size of Chrome updates. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if generating the update takes 3 hours, since it will be downloaded millions of times, and a 600KB saved in this manner will pay themselves many time over. But those kind of costs are not something that we can pay. Analysis of our memory usage patterns also showed that in many cases, we are using mostly fixed addressing. In other words, we&#x2019;ll typically change only small parts of the page, and we don&#x2019;t tend to have moving writes. When we do (typically on defrag), we do them on a page boundary, so RLE implementation should generate good savings. We have an implementation that we are currently testing, but while you can read the code, what is more interesting is the assumptions that we are making. We scan the original and modified buffers using longs. We can safely assume that the buffers we scan are always sized in pages, so we don&#x2019;t need to worry about buffers whose size isn&#x2019;t divisible in sizeof(long), this make the code much simpler. We also don&#x2019;t bother to encode identical parts, instead, we record the (start, count, raw bytes) differences from the original. There is a small optimization there for long runs of zeros (to make it cheaper to delete data), but beyond that, we do very little.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ll have a separate post to dive into the actual implementation details and considerations that drove it, but that is for later. An important reason why we don&#x2019;t keep track of the unmodified data is that we don&#x2019;t need it, and that we can&#x2019;t actually trust the original data. Consider the case where we actually need to use the journal to recover. We do that by running through all of the transactions, and applying the diffs to the data. The problem is that we may fail midway through the recovery process, so the state of the data is not known. When applying a diff, if we use the original data, we might actually see data from a later transaction (which was applied, but we don&#x2019;t know about it since we crashed before we can make a note of that). Because of this, we only use the modified data, which is safe to apply multiple times. Note that this assumes that modifying a page can not corrupt the page. In other words, if I have a 4 KB page, and I write a value to the 3rd byte, it isn&#x2019;t going to cause any change to any other byte. Aside from that, we don&#x2019;t require that the bytes that we modified will be there on restart, because we&#x2019;ll overwrite them until we are sure that we properly synced them. Another aspect of the diff operation that we aren&#x2019;t actually all that worried about the data size (which is interesting, since we really want to reduce it), the reason for that is that we are going to throw all the diffed data into the compressor anyway. The idea is that even after the diff, we are still likely to find data to compress among the modifications on the transaction.  Currently, the steps to write a transaction to disk are:  Get all the modified pages. For each of those, compute the difference between it and the previous version of that page. Compress all the diffs of all the pages. Write the compressed data to disk in a safe manner.</p>

The _requestExecuters value is a concurrent dictionary. And the major difference is the kind of allocations that happen in each call. In the first scenario, we&#x2019;ll create a new RequestExecuter each time that we call this line. We&#x2019;ll still use only a single instance, of course, but we still create (and discard) an instance per call.  In the second scenario, we are passing a delegate, so we&#x2019;ll only create the RequestExecuter once. Or so it seems. The problem is that under concurrent load, it is possible that we&#x2019;ll have two RequestExecuters created, only one of which will be used. If we have any unmanaged resources in the RequestExecuter, that can cause a leak. Another issue is that we are using the method parameter, which forces the compiler to capture it, and allocate a new delegate instance per call. The third scenario is the same as the second one, but we aren&#x2019;t capturing the parameter, so the compiler will not need to create a new delegate instance per call. The forth one is using a lazy value. This way, we avoid the race in creating the RequestExecuter, but we still create a new lazy instance per call. And the fifth one is using a lazy instance and a cached delegate version, so there are no extra allocations there. There is still the race to create the lazy instance, but that should happen rarely, and it isn&#x2019;t holding any expensive resources.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into this post, which updates the (by now) venerable Joel Test to our modern age. I remember reading the Joel Test (as well as pretty much anything by Joel) at the beginning of my career and I&#x2019;m pretty sure that it influenced the way I choose employers and designed software. Seeing this post, I decided to see how Hibernating Rhinos would rank on this test today. I put both the original and updated version, and my comments are below.    &#xA0; Original Updated  1  Do you use source control? &#xA0;  2  Can you make a build in one step?  Can you build and deploy your software in one step?  3  Do you make daily builds?  Do you build on every commit?  4  Do you have a bug database? &#xA0;  5  Do you fix bugs before writing new code? &#xA0;  6  Do you have an up-to-date schedule?  Do you measure your progress in terms of value delivered?  7  Do you have a spec?  Do you have a runnable spec?  8  Do programmers have quiet working conditions?  Does your environment foster collaboration?  9  Do you use the best tools money can buy? &#xA0;  10  Do you have testers?  Is testing everyone&#x27;s responsibility?  11  Do new candidates write code during their interview? &#xA0;  12 Do you do hallway usability testing? &#xA0; &#xA0;  Source control &#x2013; Yes, thankfully, I think that the days of anyone not using source control for anything but a scratch project are behind us. Now the arguments are which source control.  Build &amp; deploy in one step &#x2013; Yes, the build process runs on a Team City server, and while it sometimes require some TLC (I&#x2019;m looking at you , nuget), it pretty much runs without us having to pay much attention to it.  Build &amp; verify on every commit &#x2013; No. But yes. What we do is have the build server run the full suite on every Pull Request, which is our unit of integration. Commits are far less important, because we break them apart to make them easier to review.  Bug database &#x2013; Yes, but see also the next topic. We mostly use it for bugs we find, and features / improvements, not so much for customers bugs.  Do you fix bugs before writing new code &#x2013; No. But yes. The reason this is complex to answer is how you define bugs. A customer issue is typically handled from A to Z on the spot. We have a rotating function of support engineer that handle such scenarios, and they prioritize that over their routine work.  Do you have a schedule / do you measure progress in term of value &#x2013; We have a rough schedule, with guidelines about this is hard deadline and this is a nice deadline. Hard deadline is about meeting outside commitments, typically. Nice deadlines are about things we would like to do, but we won&#x2019;t kill ourselves doing them. We do have a sense of what is important and what isn&#x2019;t. By that I mean is that we have a criteria for &#x201C;we should be chasing after this&#x201D; and &#x201C;this is for when we run out of things to do&#x201D;.  Do you have a (runnable) spec?&#xA0; - Yes, we have a spec. It isn&#x2019;t runnable, and I&#x2019;m not sure what a runnable spec for a database would be. The spec outline thinks like the data format and how we do data fetches for indexes, architectural considerations and rough guidelines into where we are going. It isn&#x2019;t detailed to the point of being runnable, and I don&#x2019;t like the idea very much.  Developers have quite working conditions / environment encourage collaboration&#xA0; &#x2013; The typical setup we have is a separate office for every two developers. I typically see people move around the offices and collaborate on all sort of stuff. If it bugs the other dev in the room, they usually have headphones to deal with it, but that isn&#x2019;t happening enough to be a major problem. A common issue for people who leave their workstation unattended and use headphones is that by the time they get back and put the headphones, the music has been changes to something suitably amusing, such as this one.  Best tools that money can buy &#x2013; Procurement in Hibernating Rhinos is a process, it involves sending an email with &#x201C;I need this tool&#x201D;, and you must include the link to the tool. Then you have to wait anything between 15 minutes to 24 hours (depending on when you asked), and you&#x2019;ll get the license. I have seen far too many stupid decisions of &#x201C;oh, we don&#x2019;t have a budget for this 200$ tool but we&#x2019;ve no problem paying the 2000$ that it would cost us in time&#x201D; to suffer that.  Testers / everyone is a responsible &#x2013; Yes. Every single dev is writing tests, and every single PR is sent after tests has been run locally, and then on the build server.  Candidates write code in interview &#x2013; Yes, oh yes they do.  Hallway usability testing &#x2013; See below, too complex to answer here. RavenDB has multiple level of &#x201C;user interface&#x201D;. The most obvious one is the RavenDB studio, but the one that we spend the most time on is the external (and internal) APIs. For the API, we have a review process in place to make sure that we are consistent and make sense. Most of the time we are doing things that follow the same design line as before, so there is not much to think about. For big things, we typically also solicit feedback from the community, to make sure that we aren&#x2019;t looking into with colored glasses.  For our actual user interface, the Studio, we used to just have the other devs look at the new functionality.&#xA0; But that led to a lot of stuff that worked, but the amount of attention we actually paid to the UI used to be really variable. Some features we would iterate over for multiple weeks, getting them just right (the most common operations, as we see them). But other stuff was just &#x201C;we need to expose this functionality, let us do this&#x201D;, which led to almost one to one mapping of the server side concept to the UI, which isn&#x2019;t always helpful for the users. We have started with a full UX study of the RavenDB Studio, and we are going to be doing full design analysis on each of our views with an eye to improve it significantly by 4.0.</p>
