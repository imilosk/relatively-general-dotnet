            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Recently there have been a long discussion in the ALT.Net mailing list about Auto Mocking Containers. We covered a lot of ground there and it is interesting to boot.  What I wanted to talk about comes from this discussion. A while ago there was a big stick about Persistence Ignorance. I won&#x27;t reiterate the arguments, but I want to expand the idea to other concepts as well. It is not just persistence that your code should be ignorant of, it is all the infrastructure concerns in general. I don&#x27;t care how good your infrastructure code is, it is still nasty pitfall of technicalities. I know that all of mine have been this way. The IoC container that you use shouldn&#x27;t appear anywhere in your code, nor should the persistence concerns mix themselves with the actual code. Invasive approaches, no matter what they do, should be frowned on. A lot of people thinks that the model below is a good one to follow:  Personally, I think that it putting too much emphasis on the infrastructure. The infrastructure should not sit at the heart of the application. It should be shoved to some misbegotten corner and only see the light of day if there is no other choice.  The diagram below demonstrate how I think it should be.    There should be a lot more weight for the actual application code than the infrastructure code, and only at well defined locations will you have domain services call down to the infrastructure. In fact, I would like to isolate that as much as possible. Dependency Injection, AOP and minor amount of wrapping should allow you to get an application that is infrastructure ignorance.  The immediate result of which is that you get a lot more focus on actual business value than on implemented two phase commit using FAT12 file system.  That is not to say that infrastructure is not important, it is critically important. But the infrastructure should not be invasive.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just and took a look at the recent Dot Net Rocks show, as a way to look at &quot;what the market is thinking about&quot;. I got some interesting responses from looking at the titles. I haven&#x27;t listen to all of them (not by far), but I won&#x27;t let that stop me from commenting.  Adam Nathan on Popfly and SilverlightNot interested at all. Something that belongs to another planet as far as I am concerned. Combining Popfly (some sort of purple duck, I understand) and Silverlight puts it on the far reaches of Saturn, as far as I am concerned. Miguel de Icaza and Geoff Norton on MonoDefiantly interesting, I have been keeping an eye on Mono for a while, I am waiting to see how it works on the Mac, and I argued for Mono based deployment in several projects in the past. EC2 &#x2B; Mono seems like a very interesting option. Andy Leonard on Unit Testing your DatabaseSeems interesting, but mostly my answer to that is: Use in-memory database for that. Oh, and don&#x27;t use SSIS. Rhino ETL is trivially testable, by the way. Kirk Munro on Powershell and PowerGUINot interested in PowerShell beyond the most cursory of glances. If I want scripting, I got Boo.  Simon Peyton Jones on Haskell and Functional ProgrammingThis is something that I have yet to listen, but it is interesting, mostly because it is a totally different mind-set than the one I usually use. Les Pinter Looks BackThat was a fun show, not technical content, but really good to listen to it. Aaron Skonnard puts BizTalk and WCF TogetherI get the shivers just thinking about the subject, next. Sahil Malik Shares the PointAnd I&#x27;ll keep on going missing the point.  David Aiken on Bridging the Gap between Dev and ITThis looks like an interesting show.  Steven Lees on FeedSyncNot interested, I even took a look at the description to ensure that I am not interested. Kathleen Dollard on the Evolution of Software DevelopmentThat was a fun show. Ken Levy on Visual Studio Extensibility (VSX)I need to be interested in that, because I have a chapter about IDEs that I need to write, but... that is not an interesting topic to me. Go write in notepad. Jeff Prosise Goes Deep on SilverlightDid I mention that it is not interesting? Joe Duffy on the Task Parallel LibraryThat was a good show, and something that I actively looking at. Richard Campbell Tells All!Very good show. Jeff Palermo on ASP.NET MVCIt was a good show, but the topic is not interesting, as far as I am concerned. Gael Fraiteur on PostSharpPostSharp is something that I keep looking at, haven&#x27;t found the need for it, but it is an interesting project, and surprisingly outside my usual circles. Tomas Petricek on PHP in ASP.NET and Silverlight! Yawn, yawn.  Open Source Panel Discussion at DevTeach, VancouverI refer to this episode as the &quot;if loop&quot; show. Naveen Yajaman on Visual Studio Tools for ApplicationsThrough this show, I kept thinking: Or they could use Boo, get everything that they want and not have to pay &quot;undisclosed&quot; amount in licensing. Colin Miller and the .NET Micro Framework!Interesting in the abstract, not sure of its utility. F# Moves ForwardI have this low level urge to look at F#, but I am just not interested enough. Dot Net Nuke Discussion PanelNot interested. Kent Alstad at Dev Connections!This should be a scalability show, which are generally interesting, except that I am sick of hearing about &quot;don&#x27;t use view state&quot;, or the fallacy of &quot;scalability means that you can&#x27;t use convient idioms&quot; Tim Sneath and Ian Ellison-Taylor on Windows Past, Present and FutureThat should be interesting.  Pablo Castro on AstoriaIf I recall correctly, Anders Nor&#xE5;s wrote an equivalent for that in a few hours. Not really interested. I think that I&#x27;ll leave interpretation of those for the comments, but it looks to me like technology topics are growing very old, very fast.</p>

Interesting feeling, and I do miss the car so very much... This also puts me in the interesting position of being laptop-less. This is less comfortable than I thought it would be. I have a week or two before I can get my new laptop. Following quite a few recommendations, I got a MacBook Pro 17&quot;. I&#x27;ll report about it when I get it. Current task, and the reason that I don&#x27;t have much time, writing the book. It turns out to be much harder than expected. I can get 5 pages in an hour or two at one seating, or I can get two sentences in the same time period in the next (the reason that I am blogging now instead of slaving away at the manuscript). Oh, and I changed the blog, can you spot what is different?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">During the past two weeks I built a system that is estimated at roughly 2 man months. No, I am not a coding monster, and I go lightly on the caffeinated beverages. I did that by explicitly stating that the code will have all the required features, but it will not be ready for production. It is important to understand the difference between such an effort and demo driven or spike driven code. In both later cases, the main goal is to get something that works, without regard to maintainability or long term survivability of the code / effort. This means that you can take some very rough shortcuts along the way, to get there as fast as possible. In this case, we have every intention of taking the same code base and getting it ready for production, but the overall structure and features must have been completed by that time. (This is a hard deadline constrained by yours truly availability, and cannot be budged.) As such, I had to make the make compromises. They mostly dealt with error handling, validation and edge cases. That is, the thing works, and it has a solid foundation, but you are going to get... weird results if you try to do some things. Like trying to end before start, or generate a roster for the next 100 years. This exercise got me thinking, do I really think that error handling, validation and edge case coverage are going to take 80% of the time? That really depends of what you need for those, as a matter of fact, but that has consistently been my experience. Getting something to work tends to be fairly easy. Getting it to work right under attack is the hard bit. Getting it to fail correctly is ever harder. In this case, I couldn&#x27;t do any of those, so I made sure that when it failed, it would fail safely. That is a start, and we can build from there. Another aspect that I have not touched is logging and auditing, which is critically important. If I need to debug to figure out what went wrong then I am in the wrong place without a map or a compass.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">And then there is the issue of managing the application components. We want to keep the single responsibility principal, and we want to reduce dependencies in our application. Let us assume that we are talking about a MonoRail application. In this case, we tend to have the following distinct components:  Controllers Domain Services Infrastructure Services I am not counting the domain classes here because they are not components in the strict sense of the word. I am big believer in convention over configuration, and in this case Binsor allows me to easy define convention for the project. Here is a sample of a Binsor configuration file from my current project (MonoRail application): facility MonoRailFacility&#xA;facility  &quot;RhinoTransactionFacility&quot;, RhinoTransactionFacility &#xA;facility &quot;RegisterResolversFacility&quot;, RegisterResolversFacility &#xA;&#xA;component &quot;LoggerFactory&quot;, ILoggerFactory, Log4netFactory:&#xA;&#x9;configFile: Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, &quot;log4net.config&quot;)&#xA;&#xA;# Data Access&#xA;component &quot;active_record_repository&quot;, IRepository, ARRepository&#xA;component &quot;active_record_unit_of_work&quot;, IUnitOfWorkFactory, ActiveRecordUnitOfWorkFactory:&#xA;&#x9;assemblies: ( Assembly.Load(&quot;My.App.Model&quot;), )&#xA;&#xA;# Controllers&#xA;for type in AllTypesBased[of Controller](&quot;My.App.Web&quot;):&#xA;&#x9;component type&#xA;&#xA;# services&#xA;for type in AllTypesIn(&quot;My.App&quot;, &quot;My.App.Web&quot;).WithNamespaceContaining(&quot;Services&quot;):&#xA;&#x9;continue if type.GetInterfaces().Length == 0:&#xA;&#x9;interfaceType = type.GetInterfaces()[0]&#xA;&#x9;interfaceType = interfaceType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() if interfaceType.IsGenericType&#xA;&#x9;component type.FullName, interfaceType, type&#xA;This means that all controllers are automatically registered, and that all the services are automatically registered using their first interface. The immediate result is that I don&#x27;t need to think about IoC or DI, I just create a service and a service interface, and I am done.&#xA;For a smart client app, the situation is a bit more complex, here is the entire Binsor configuration for the smart client portion of the project:&#xA;facility WcfClientFacility:&#xA;&#x9;services = {&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;ISchedulingService : SchedulingService&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#x9;&#xA;&#xA;for type in Assembly.Load(&quot;My.App.Scheduling&quot;).GetTypes():&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;continue unless type.Namespace == &quot;My.App.Scheduling.Controllers&quot;&#xA;&#x9;continue if type.IsAbstract or type.IsInterface:&#xA;&#x9;continue if IoC.Container.Kernel.HasComponent(type.FullName)&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;if type.GetInterfaces().Length == 0:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;component type.FullName, type&#xA;&#x9;else:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;component type.FullName, type.GetInterfaces()[0], type&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;for type in Assembly.Load(&quot;My.App.Scheduling&quot;).GetTypes():&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;continue unless type.Namespace == &quot;My.App.Scheduling.Views&quot;&#xA;&#x9;continue if type.IsAbstract or type.IsInterface:&#xA;&#x9;continue if IoC.Container.Kernel.HasComponent(type.FullName)&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;viewInterface as Type = null&#xA;&#x9;for i in type.GetInterfaces():&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;continue unless i.Namespace == &quot;My.App.Scheduling.Views&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;continue if i.Name == &quot;IView&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;viewInterface = i&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;if viewInterface is null:&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;raise &quot;All views must implement a view interface, but ${type.FullName} doesn&#x27;t.&quot;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;component type.FullName, viewInterface, type&#xA;As an aside, I am also using this script to enforce the conventions, all views must implement an interface, and it is an error if they are not doing so, as an example.&#xA;Using this approach, you get seamless IoC experience. It is just the natural thing to do. For that matter, here is the constructor of a class that I never touched:&#xA;public NewServicePlanController(&#xA;&#x9;ApplicationShell shell,&#xA;&#x9;ApplicationContext context,&#xA;&#x9;ISelectServiceOrdersView selectServiceOrdersView,&#xA;&#x9;ISelectSystemUsersView selectSystemUsersView,&#xA;&#x9;INewServicePlanView newServicePlanView,&#xA;&#x9;IAccountServicePlanActionsView accountServicePlanActionsView,&#xA;&#x9;IAccountServicePlanSummaryView accountServicePlanSummaryView,&#xA;&#x9;IServicePlanCalendarView&lt;AccountGetService&gt; calendarView,&#xA;&#x9;ISchedulingService schedulingService)&#xA;At this point, I think that we have too much segregation in the views, and we could use a presenter to encapsulate some of them, but that is a good place to be, in my opinion.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Greg Young posted about some issues that he run into with yield statements and compile time verifications in Spec#. He ends with:  Given this information are iterators something that are THAT desirable? Iterators are syntactical sugar, I can duplicate what an iterator does rather simply in code that does not use an iterator &#x2026; Are they worth me giving up the possibility of removing all of my runtime checks or introducing this complexity? My answer, yes, they are 100% desirable.  OO is syntactic sugar, there is enough object oriented C code out there to prove that, at least. But syntactic sugar matters, it matters because it allows you to reduce the complexity and move it to the compiler.  Take Rhino ETL as an example, the whole thing revolves around the idea of iterators. Making it any more complex than it has to will cause it to be infeasible. The weight of the pattern or approach has direct correlation to its applicability. Dependency Injection doesn&#x27;t work without an IoC container around, and iterators are far less useful if you don&#x27;t have yield to make the pain go away.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After talking about the advantages setting up environments where the laziest approach is also the faster approach, I want to talk a bit about the details of actually doing it. Zero Friction approach is very important for the overall success of a project, because it means that the right thing is the easy thing, so that is what will get done.  Something to note is that this doesn&#x27;t excuse ignorance, the developers using this approach should be able to at least understand the concepts and methods that they use. I am saying that there is no excuse for making the right thing the hard thing. That is setting yourself up for failure. We will start from the database, a subject near and dear to my heart. When you are working with a database, you are going to have to deal with schema changes, and those can be a pain if you are making rapid modifications, very often. This is even more of a pain when you are building the domain model, and keep having to make changes all the time. My solution for that is to setup a /home/createindex.castle action, which has the following code: [AccessibleThrough(Verb.Post)]&#xA;public void CreateDatabase(bool allow)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;allow&quot;] = allow;&#xA;&#x9;if (allow == false)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;message&quot;] = &quot;You must check the box in order to create the database&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;if(Request.IsLocal == false)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;message&quot;] = &quot;This action is only valid from the local machine&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;return;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;try&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ActiveRecordStarter.CreateSchema();&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;message&quot;] = &quot;Database successfully created&quot;;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;catch (Exception ex)&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;PropertyBag[&quot;error&quot;] = ex;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;This means that I can hit a web page, check a box, submit and I have a new database. The reason that I have the extra steps in the middle is that I this is a destructive operation.&#xA;Another option is to use the SchemaUpdate feature that was recently added to NHibernate, that is a non destructive operation, one that you can safely put inside the Application_Start method.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here is something that caught by surprise. Sharp OS and Cosmos OS are two operating systems written in C#. That is not something that you traditionally do with managed languages. So far I have had a look at Sharp OS source code, which seems nice, although I am taken aback by the amount of unsafe code that is there. Of course, it is not like there is much choice in the matter. I was particularly amused by the implementation on inline assembly:   But other pieces of the code are make me feel that I am looking at some... other language:   You can take the kernel out of C, but you can&#x27;t get the C out of the kernel, I would say. I took a brief look at the Cosmos code as well, and it is not significantly different. The way both projects go about building kernels with managed languages is to do IL -&gt; assembly translation at some point, and then run that. Very interesting concept, although one that I have an academic interest at only. At least until they both get a viable TCP/IP stack and I can start using them as embedded systems. Until then, I think that a stripped down Linux &#x2B; Mono would do the trick fairly well.</p>
