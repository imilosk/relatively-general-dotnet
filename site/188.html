            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">They just aren&#x2019;t. And I&#x2019;m talking as someone who has actually implemented multiple distributed transaction systems. People moving to microservices are now discovering a lot of the challenges and hurdles of distributed systems and it is only natural to want to go back to the cozy transactional world, where you can reason about things properly. This post is in response to this article: Microservices and distributed transactions, which I read with interest, because it isn&#x2019;t often that a post will refute it&#x2019;s own premise with the very first statement.The two-phase commit protocol was designed in the epoch of the &#x201C;big iron&#x201D; systems like mainframes and UNIX servers; the XA specification was defined in 1991 when the typical deployment model consisted of having all the software installed in a single server.That is a really important observation, because in this case, we remove one big factor from the distributed transactions, the distributed part. Note that this is almost 30 years ago, distributed transactions and the two phase commit protocol aren&#x2019;t running on a single node any longer. But the architecture is still rooted into the same concept. And it doesn&#x2019;t work. I wrote a blog post explaining the core issues with two phase commit about 5 years ago. Nothing changed so far.From a technical perspective, the approach that is shown in the article is interesting. It is really nice that you can have a &#x201C;transaction&#x201D; that spawn multiple services and databases. It is a problem that this isn&#x2019;t going to result in an atomic behavior (you can observe some of the transactions being committed before others), it is a problem that this has really bad failure modes (hanging / timeout / inconsistencies) under fairly common scenarios and finally, it is a really bad approach because your microservices shouldn&#x2019;t be composed using transactions.Leaving aside all the technical details about why two phase commit is a bad idea, there is still the core architectural issue, you are tying together the services in your system. If service A is stalled for whatever reason, your service B is now impacted because it is waiting for a transaction to close.Have fun trying to debug something like that, especially because you actual state is hidden away in some transaction manager and not readily visible. It means adding a tricky layer of complexity that will break, and will cause issues, and will create silent dependencies between your services. Silent ones, invisible ones, and they will come to haunt you.The whole point of a microservice architecture is separation of concerns to independently managed, deployed and provisioned systems. If you need to actually have cross service transactions, you either have modelled things wrong or are doing very badly. Go back to a monolith with a single database backend and use that as the transactional store. You&#x2019;ll be much happier.Remember: Microservices. Are. Separated.That isn&#x2019;t a bug, that isn&#x2019;t a hurdle to overcome. That is the point. Tying them close together is a mistake, but you&#x2019;ll usually only see it after a few months of production. So take a measure of prevention before you&#x2019;ll need a metric ton of cures.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post was triggered by this post. Mostly because I got people looking strangely at me when I shouted DO NOT DO THAT when I read the post.We&#x2019;ll use the usual Users and Orders example, because that is simple to work with. We have the usual concerns about users in our application:AuthenticationPassword resetTwo factor authUnusual activity detectionEtc, etc, etc.AuthorizationCan the user perform this particular operation?Can the user perform this action on this item?Can the user perform this action on this item on behalf of this user?Authentication itself is a fairly simple process. Don&#x2019;t build that, go and use a builtin solution, authentication is complex, but the good side of it is that there are rarely any business specific stuff around it. You need to authenticate a user, and that is one of those things that is generally such a common concern that you can take an off the shelve solution and go with that.Authorization is a lot more interesting. Note that we have three separate ways to ask the same question. It might be better to give concrete examples about what I mean for each one of them.Can the user create a new order? Can they check the recent product updates, etc? Note that in this case, we aren&#x2019;t operating on a particular entity, but performing global actions.Can the user view this order? Can they change the shipping address?&#xA0; Note that in this case, we have both authorization rules (you should be able to view your own orders) and business rules (you can change the shipping address on your order if the order didn&#x2019;t ship and the shipping cost is the same).Can the helpdesk guy check the status of an order for a particular customer? In this case, we have a user that is explicitly doing an action on behalf on another user. We might allow it (or not), but we almost always want to make a special note of this.The interesting thing about this kind of system is that there are very different semantics for each of those operations. One off the primary goals for a microservice architecture is the separation of concerns, I don&#x2019;t want to keep pinging the authorization service on each operation. That is important. And not just for the architectural purity of the system, one of the most common reasons for performance issues in systems is the cost of authorization checks. If you make that go over the network, that is going to kill your system.Therefor, we need to consider how to enable proper encapsulation of concerns. An easy to do that is to have the client hold that state. In other words, as part off the authentication process, the client is going to get a token, which it can use for the next calls. That token contains the list of allowed operations / enough state to compute the authorization status for the actual operations. Naturally, that state is not something that the client can modify, and is protected with cryptography. A good example of that would be JWT. The authorization service generate a token with a key that is trusted by the other services. You can verify most authorization actions without leaving your service boundary.This is easy for operations such as creating a new order, but how do you handle authorization on a specific entity? You aren&#x2019;t going to be able to encode all the allowed entities in the token, at least not in most reasonable systems. Instead, you combine the allowed operations and the semantics of the operation itself. In other words, when loading an order, you check whatever the user has &#x201C;orders/view/self&#x201D; operation and that the order is for the same user id. A more complex process is required when you have operations on behalf of. You don&#x2019;t want the helpdesk people to start sniffing into what &lt;Insert Famous Person Name Here&gt; ordered last night, for example. Instead of complicating the entire system with &#x201C;on behalf of&#x201D; operations, a much better system is to go back to the authorization service. You can ask that service to generate you a special &#x201C;on behalf of&#x201D; token, with the user id of the required user. This create an audit trail of such actions and allow the authorization service to decide if a particular user should have the authority to act on behalf of a particular user.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This post is in reply to this one: Is a Shared Database in Microservices Actually an Anti-pattern?The author does a great job outlining the actual problem. Given two services that need to share some data, how do you actually manage that in a microservice architecture? The author uses the Users and Orders example, which is great, because it is pretty simple and require very little domain knowledge. The first question to ask is: Why? Why use microservices? Wikipedia says:The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity. This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion.I always like an application that is easier to understand, develop and test. Being resilient to architecture erosion is a nice bonus. The problem is that this kind of architecture isn&#x2019;t free. A system that is composed of microservices is a system that need to communicate between these services, and that is usually where most of the complexity in such a system reside.In the Orders service, if we need to access some details about the User, how do we do that?We can directly call to the Users service, but that creates a strong dependency between the services. If Users is down, then Orders is down. That sort of defeats the purpose of the architecture. It also means that we don&#x2019;t actually have separate services, we just have exchange the call assembly instruction with RPC and distributed debugging. All the costs, none of the benefits.The post above rightly calls this problematic, and asks whatever async integration between the services would work, using streams. I&#x2019;m not quite sure what was meant there. My usual method of integrating different microservices is to not do that, instead. Either we need to send a command to a different service (which is async) or we need to publish some data from a service (also async). Both of these options are assuming to be failure resistant and unreliable. In other words, if I send a command to another service, and I need to handle failure, I setup a timer to let me know to handle not being called back.Even if you just need some data published from another service, and can use a feature such as RavenDB ETL to share that data. You still need to take into account issues such as network failures causing you to have a laggy view of the data. This is not an accident.That is not your data, you have a copy (potentially stale) of published data from another service. You can use that for reference, but you cannot count on it. If you need to rely on that data, you need to send a command to the owning service, which can then make the actual decision.In short, this is not a trivial matter. Even if the actual implementation can be done pretty easily.The fact that each service owns a particular portion of the system is a core principle of the microservice architecture. Having a shared database is like having a back stage pass. It&#x2019;s great, in theory, but it is also open for abuse. And it will be abused. I can guarantee that with 100% confidence.If you blur the lines between services, they are no longer independent. Have fun trying to debug why your Users&#x2019; login time spiked (Orders&#x2019; is running the monthly report). Enjoy breaking the payment processing system (you added a new type of user that the Orders system can&#x2019;t process). And these are the good parts. I haven&#x2019;t started to talk about what happens when the Orders service actually attempt to write to the Users&#x2019; tables. The article suggests using DB ACL to control that, but you already having something better. A different database, because it is a different service.It might be better to think about the situation like joint bank account. It&#x2019;s reasonable to a have a joint bank account with your spouse. It is not so reasonable to have a joint bank account with Mary from accounting, because that make it easier to direct deposit your payroll. There is separation there for a reason, and yes, that does make things harder.That&#x2019;s the point, it is not an accident.The whole point is that integration between services is going to be hard, so you&#x2019;ll have less of that, and you&#x2019;ll have that along very well defined boundaries. That means that we can have proper boundaries and contracts between different areas, which lead us to better modularity, thus allowing easier development, deployment and management.If that isn&#x2019;t something you want, that is fine, just don&#x2019;t go into the microservice architecture. Because a monolith architecture is just fine, but a Frankenstein creation of a microservice architecture with shared database is not. Just ask Mary from accounting&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB 4.x is using X509 Certificates for authentication. We got a feedback question from a customer about that, they much rather to use API Keys, instead.We actually considered this as part of the design process for 4.x and we concluded that we can make this work in just the same manner as API Keys. Here is how you can make it work.You have the certificate file (usually PFX) and convert that to a Base64 string, like so:[System.Convert]::ToBase64String( (gc &quot;cert.pfx&quot; -Encoding byte ) )You can take the resulting string and store it like an API key, because that is effectively how it is treated. In your application startup, you can use:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last week we had a couple of interesting milestones. The first of which is that we reached the End Of Life for RavenDB 3.0. If you are still running on RavenDB 3.0 (or any previous version), be aware that this marks the end of the support cycle for that version. You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to RavenDB 3.5 (which still has about 1.5 years of support).I got an email today from a customer talking about maybe considering upgrade from the RavenDB version that was released in Dec 2012, so I&#x2019;m very familiar with slow upgrade cycles. End of Life for 3.0 means that we no longer offer support for it. If your operations team is dragging their feet on the upgrade, please hammer this point home. We really want to see people running on at least 3.5. The other side of the news is that the new bits for RavenDB 4.2 Release Candidate are out. This release moves out of the experimental phase features such as Cluster Wide Transactions and Counters and introduce Graph Queries support. As usual, I would really love your feedback.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A decade(!) ago&#xA0; I wrote that you should avoid soft deletes. Today I run into a question in the mailing list and I remembered writing about this, it turned out that there has been quite the discussion on this at the time.&#xA;&#xA;My post on avoiding soft deletes&#xA;Richard&#x2019;s post on the trouble data deletion cause&#xA;Udi&#x2019;s post about never deleting data&#xA;Dare&#x2019;s post summarizing most of the discussion&#xA;&#xA;The context of the discussion at the time was deleting data from relational systems, but the same principles apply. The question I just fielded asked how you can translate a Delete() operation inside the RavenDB client to a soft delete (IsDeleted = true) operation. The RavenDB client API supports a few ways to interact with how we are talking to the underlying database, including some pretty interesting hooks deep into the pipeline.&#xA;What it doesn&#x2019;t offer, though, is a way to turn a Delete() operation into and update (or an update to a delete). We do have facilities in place that allow you to detect (and abort) on invalid operations. For example, invoices should never be deleted. You can tell the RavenDB client API that it should throw whenever an invoice is about to be deleted, but you have no way of saying that we should take the Delete(invoice) and turn that into a soft delete operation.&#xA;This is quite intentionally by design.&#xA;Having a way to transform basic operations (like delete &#x2013;&gt; update) is a good way to be pretty confused about what is actually going on in the system. It is better to allow the user to enforce the required behavior (invoices cannot be deleted) and let the calling code handle this different.&#xA;The natural response here, of course, is that this places a burden on the calling code. Surely we want to be able to follow DRY and not write conditionals when the user clicks on the delete button. But this isn&#x2019;t an issue where this is extra duplicated code.&#xA;&#xA;An invoice is never deleted, it is cancelled. There are tax implications on that, you need to get it correct.&#xA;A payment is never removed, it is refunded.&#xA;&#xA;You absolutely want to block deletions of those type of documents, and you need to treat them (very) different in code.&#xA;In the enusing decade since the blog posts at the top of this post were written, there have been a number of changes. Some of them are architecturally minor, such as the database technology of choice or the guiding principles for maintainable software development. Some of them are pretty significant.&#xA;One such change is the GDPR.&#xA;&#x201C;Huh?!&#x201D; I can imagine you thinking. How does the GDPR applies to an architectural discussion of soft deletes vs. business operations. It turns out that it is very relevant. One of the things that the GDPR mandates (and there are similar laws elsewhere, such as the CCPA) the right to be forgotten. So if you are using soft deletes, you might actually run into real problems down the line. &#x201C;I asked to be deleted, they told me they did, but they secretly kept my data!&#x201D;.&#xA0; The one thing that I keep hearing about the GDPR is that no one ever found it humorous. Not with the kind of penalties that are attached to it.&#xA;So when thinking about deletes in your system, you need to consider quite a few factors:&#xA;&#xA;Does it make sense, from a business perspective, to actually lose that data? Deleting a note from a customer&#x2019;s record is probably just fine. Removing the record of the customer at all? Probably not.&#xA;Do I need to keep this data? Invoices are one thing that pops to mind.&#xA;Do I need to forget this data? That is the other way, and what you can forget and how can be really complex.&#xA;&#xA;At any rate, for all but the simplest scenarios, just marking IsDeleted = true is likely not going to be sufficient. And all the other arguments that has been raised (which I&#x2019;m not going to repeat, read the posts, they are good ones) are still in effect.</p>
