            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Dear ALT.NET Community,  You are likely familiar with that classic Warren Zevon song, Werewolves of London. I was reminded of this the last night being in London under a full moon and in the same hotel as one of the more famous Lycanthropic developers in the .NET community, Ayende Rahien, with whom you are also likely familiar as, well, you are reading his feed. Duh.  Shocked? Read on...  To call Ayende a werewolf is inacurate, of course. A lycanthrope, yes: Half-man, half-animal (i.e. manimal). But his primal half does not take the form of the lupine. Rather, Ayende is a were-Rhino. This should be obvious given the various logos and trade names he chooses. There you have it! His shape-shifting nature explains his Rhino fetish along with the genesis of the names of such projects RhinoMocks, RhinoCommons, Hibernating Rhinos, etc.  Yes we&#x27;re all familiar with the conventional wisdom detailed in the classic essay of the same name by Fred Brooks, &quot;No Silver Bullets.&quot; In this corner case of our industry there is a silver bullet, a couple (luckily, friends)!  There are a few things you can do to protect yourself from this marauding monster, Mr. Rahien. When in his manimilian state, if you ask him a question about NHibernate, you will stop the abomination in his tracks. If, being a proper member of the ALT.NET tribe, you cannot think of an NHibernate question (as you are undoubtedly an expert at this point) engage the brute in a discussion regarding the popular science fiction book series, &quot;The Wheel of Time.&quot; That should do.  IMPORTANT: a curious, oft-overlooked but quite dangerous feature of the wererhino is that the beastly transformation can be triggered when the subject views a piece of code built on the Entity Framework. Be very, very careful when working with EF code around Ayende.  You have been warned.  Yours truly,  Dave Laribee</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Dror from TypeMock has managed to capture the essence of my post about unit tests vs. integration tests quite well:     Unit tests runs faster but integration tests are easier to write.   Unfortunately, he draws an incorrect conclusion out of that;     There is however another solution instead of declaring unit testing as hard to write - use an isolation framework which make writing unit test much easier.    And the answer to that is&#x2026; no, you can&#x2019;t do that. Doing something like that put you back in the onerous position of unit test, where you actually have to understand exactly what is going on and have to deal with that. With an integration test, you can assert directly on the end result, which is completely different than what I would have to do if I wanted to mock a part of the system. A typical integration test looks something like:          public class SelectNPlusOne : IScenario&#xA;{&#xA;    public void Execute(ISessionFactory factory)&#xA;    {&#xA;        using (var session = factory.OpenSession())&#xA;        using (var tx = session.BeginTransaction())&#xA;        {&#xA;            var blog = session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Blog))&#xA;                .SetMaxResults(1)&#xA;                .UniqueResult&lt;Blog&gt;();//1&#xA;            foreach (var post in blog.Posts)//2&#xA;            {&#xA;                Console.WriteLine(post.Comments.Count);// SELECT N&#xA;            }&#xA;            tx.Commit();&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;[Fact]&#xA;public void AllCallsToLoadCommentsAreIdentical()&#xA;{&#xA;    ExecuteScenarioInDifferentAppDomain&lt;SelectNPlusOne&gt;();&#xA;    var array = model.Sessions[0]&#xA;        .SessionStatements&#xA;        .ExcludeTransactions()&#xA;        .Skip(2)&#xA;        .ToArray();&#xA;    Assert.Equal(10, array.Length);&#xA;    foreach (StatementModel statementModel in array)&#xA;    {&#xA;        Assert.Equal(statementModel.RawSql, array[0].RawSql);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This shows how we can assert on the actual end model of the system, without really trying to deal with what is actually going on. You cannot introducing any mocking to the mix without significantly hurting the clarity of the code.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">C# in Depth has a very different focus from most &#x201C;Learn language X&#x201D; books. Starting from the premise that you are already am familiar with the basic language syntax (for 1.0, or maybe you are a Java or C&#x2B;&#x2B; programmer), it focus entirely on the new additions to the language and platform.  Its stated goal is to take C# 1.0 developers and give them all the changes that happened to the language in the C# 2.0 and 3.0 versions. And it most certainly deserves the &#x201C;in Depth&#x201D; part of the name.  I consider myself a fairly proficient developer, and I believe that I have adequate knowledge in both C# 2.0 and 3.0, but I still found myself learning new things. More to the point, as someone who do know much of the material in the book, I was quite impress with the quality of the material, the depth of the discussion and the level in which it is being presented.  I think that Jon has managed to capture a lot of the complexities of the language in a way that is approachable, easy to understand and complete.  I have been recommending that book for clients ever since I read it, and only recently realized that I have never actually posted about it. I kept intending to, but that doesn&#x2019;t seem to put words on the blog, unfortunately (otherwise I would blog even more).   The complexity of the C# is a personal worry of mine, mostly because I see how hard it is for people to bridge the gap when moving to the newer versions of the language and having to face the explosion of possibilities. I think that this book is a big step in closing that gap.  Perhaps the best compliment that I can give to the book is that I fully intend to use the 2nd edition as the text to read to get into C# 4.0 when it is out. No reason not to let Jon do all the hard work :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been talking a lot lately about the technical aspects of working with NH Prof (and there are more posts scheduled), but not really talking about the new features at all. I firmly believe in the lynched-by-the-users model, and working for so long without having new features is an anathema to me.   I am going to try to leak them to the blog as they go fully online (with screenshotable UI), although I do mean to keep several surprises in my sleeve, and in my backpack, too, come to think about it, I need space for some of them ;-) ).  Anyway, I don&#x2019;t think that this screen shot requires any additional explanations:     Unlike my previous posts about NH Prof&#x2019;s new features, this is not currently available to download. Currently we are planning to sync up everything and show you what we got by the end of the week, so this is truly just a sneak peak right now.  The really amazing part of this feature? I did it, all on my own. The reason that I am surprised is that this feature actually have UI in it. And my facilities in UI manipulation are decidedly lacking. Nevertheless, this is all my work. The UI team didn&#x2019;t have to get involved. I mentioned before how impressed I am by the work Christopher and Rob did on NH Prof. What I didn&#x2019;t think got mentioned was the UI architecture that they built. Working separately, both me and Christopher &amp; Rob has reached the same type of general architecture, based on concepts and features.  This report is a new feature based on an existing concept. The work to make that happen was already done, when the concept was introduced. Creating a new feature is a piece of cake now, and doesn&#x2019;t require any special knowledge or any UI talent.  I am loving it.   Oh, and just to give you an idea about the time frame, I started coding the UI about 45 minutes ago, because I sat down to ensure that NH Prof was ready to show for my NHibernate workshops. I got sidetracked a bit and wired the feature into the UI. It is actually a bit more impressive, because the 45 minutes time also include the time to write the blog post :-)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As someone that so firmly believe that persistence is a solved problem, I keep tripping over it. The issue is quite simple, each scenario has radically different requirements, and usually require different solutions.  In NH Prof case, just using RDBMS is not a really good solution, but before arriving to that conclusion, I really need to explain what the requirements are. For NH Prof, there are several reasons to want to be able to persist things:     Create an offline dump of the profiling session, to be analyzed later.            This is actually a critical feature from my perspective, since it allows me to troubleshoot user issues quite easily. The user send me the dump file, I load it in NH Prof and can see exactly what their problem is.             Saving a profiling session to be analyzed at a later date (File &gt; Save / Load).    In addition to the first tow, persistence format basically means the format of a stream, and we can also use a stream as a communication mechanism.   Right now, NH Prof actually have three different ways of handling each of those tasks (xml log, binary serialization and remoting). Obviously I would like to avoid having to do this, if only because more code that does the same thing for different purposes tend to create triple the amount of work. There is also the problem that each of those methods give a different set of data to the application, which make my life quite a bit harder.  There is also another consideration, which will make sense to you when we release NH Prof v1.0, but I don&#x2019;t want to talk about that reason just yet.  So, what is the solution? Can we make it work?  The answer actually lies in the architecture that NH Prof utilize. In its core, NH Prof is a sophisticated analysis engine with a fancy UI on top. And what it analyze is the event stream from NHIbernate. That can actually cause some interesting problems. When we save to a file, what should we save? The event stream? The result of the analysis? There are arguments for both approaches.  My decision was based on several factors, simplicity and &#x201C;how much pain do I have to deal with&#x201D; were chief among them. The end result is that I decided to make use of Protocol Buffers, which is a serialization format that Google put out. It has some interesting properties, such as being fast to deserialize and serialize, light weight and cross platform. After some time struggling with the various options, I settled on Jon Skeet&#x2019;s C# implementation, and so far it looks very good. Maybe I should join the fan club? :-)  Anyway, it means that all three separate persistence options are going to move over to be a protocol buffers implementation. There are still some issues that I have to deal with, mostly with the reliability of the network connection and retries attempts, but I feel certain that I can make this happen. The end result is pretty significant simplification in the way that I am working with the codebase, and it resolve a few other problems as well (mostly related to my misuse of remoting).  All in all, I think NH Prof is rapidly moving toward a functional release status.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I can sum it up pretty easily:     Unit tests:      65 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped, took 7.49 seconds.     Integration tests:     45 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, took 284.43 seconds.   Except, there is one thing that you aren&#x2019;t seeing here. Writing an integration tests is about as straightforward as they come. Execute the user scenario, assert the result. There is no real knowledge required to write the test, and they are very easy to read and understand.  Unit tests, however, often require you to understand how the software work in much finer detail, and they often make no sense to someone who isn&#x2019;t familiar with the software.</p>
