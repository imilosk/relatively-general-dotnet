            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A while ago I was contacted by a friend who asked me if I am offering a commercial version of Rhino Mocks.  That is not a mistake, he was working in a place where the use of Open Source Software was not allowed, and decided that the simplest way to use the tool was to go through the normal route, buy it.   I wholeheartedly support this decision. :-)  Considering how hard it is to make some organizations use Open Source projects, and how used those same organizations to buying software, it is probably the right decision. It make things much simpler, and you are actually supporting OSS along the way.  At any rate, if you find yourself in the same position, you can just go and buy Rhino Mocks.  The retail version and the OSS version are&#x2026; well, look at the title, then figure it out.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The scenario for this is to create a locking mechanism in a Distributed Hash Table where nodes are allowed to fail without taking the entire DHT down.  Now, don&#x2019;t expect too much out of this, I thought this out at 2 AM or so, and just sat down to hurriedly write it before it escape my mind.  The environment in which it runs is a DHT, where a key may reside on several nodes (usually 1 or 3).&#xA0; Taking a look means placing a lock item in over half of the nodes. Lock expires after a set amount of time (because we can&#x2019;t trust the client to clear them). We assume a system that share a clock (or synchronize clocks).  The annoying thing is that we need to recover from situations in which some of the nodes holding the key are down or inaccessible.   Here is the pseudo code:          def LockKey(key, recursionDepth) as bool:    topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)    successfulLocks = 0    lockExpiry = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(1)    lockKey = key&#x2B;&quot;_lock&quot;    for server in topology:        try:            server.WriteIfDoesNotExistsOrSameServer(lockKey, currentServerName, lockExpiry)            successfulLocks &#x2B;= 1        except ServerDown:            ignore error        except KeyAlreadyExists:            if ScavengeExpiredLocks(lockKey):                return LockKey(key, recursionDepth&#x2B;1) if recursionDepth &lt; 3            return false&#xA;&#xA;        return (successfulLocks/2) &gt;= (topology.Count/2) //at least half the servers have the lock&#xA;&#xA;    def ScavengeExpiredLocks(key):    topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)    for server in topology:       try:           val = server.ReadKey(lockKey)           if HasExpired(val):                server.RemoveKey(lock, val.Version)           else:                return false       except ServerDown:           ignore error       except KeyVersionChanged:           return false          return true        def ClearLock(key):  topology = dht.GetTopologyFor(key)  for server in topology:     try:         val = server.ReadKey(lockKey)         if BelongsToCurrentServer(val):              server.RemoveKey(lock, val.Version)     except ServerDown:         ignore error     except KeyVersionChanged:         ignore error&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;So, how many critical bugs do I have here?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been using Git for the past week or so, enough to get a good handle on its benefits and disadvantages.  I moved to Git from Subversion, after having done a stint of almost 6 years of using Subversion. A stint which also included doing some development on Subversion.  Despite appearances, I actually took a fairly structured (and long running) approach to learning Git, I got a book and read it, I played around with it, and I mostly dismissed it as &#x201C;it isn&#x2019;t solving my problem&#x201D; and &#x201C;I already know how source control works&#x201D;.  Last week I had the chance to pick Aaron Jensen mind about Git, and he was able to clear up some conceptual issues about how Git operates. I made a bigger effort since to learn how I can make better use of Git and I think that I now know enough to be able to talk about it.  First, let me talk about Subversion a little bit. As I said, I am a long time user of Subversion, and I consider it an excellent source control system. It is, however, strongly aimed at meeting corporate development scenarios.  What do I mean by that? In Subversion, you have the root repository, and everything else falls out from there. That doesn&#x2019;t sounds like such a problem, until you realize that except for your local working copy, every single operation is a remote operation.  Just to give you an idea why this is a problem, looking up a history of changes (including file diffs) is a real pain in Subversion. Merging (the actual act, not keeping track of it) is a pretty long operation as well.  That was the final deal breaker for me. I feel insulted whenever I have to wait for the machine, it should be the other way around, damn it!  But there are other issues with Subversion usage, specifically, for Open Source projects I don&#x2019;t believe that the centralized model works anymore.  Consider the workflow for getting a patch in Rhino Mocks. You get the code, make the patch, send the patch. In the meantime, the project is moving ahead and you are forced to keep up with what is basically a dirty and unversioned working copy.  Worse, for me, when you send me the patch, it has to go back to the server for any old versions (slow! slow! slow!) and make me do a lot of the work.  Having a single source of truth is important, for official releases. But in the meantime, I like the idea of having multiple disparate copies that people are working on independently. They should.  Some other important thoughts, with absolutely no order:     Local history is another major important aspect. I mentioned that this is something that I sometimes do, and it is a total pain to go through that with Subversion, and it totally painless to do so with Git. I have TortoiseGit installed specifically for that, so I get a UI that I am very familiar with but with no network round tripping time.     I am not sure how to qualify this point, but it feels like Git is faster even when it does goes on the network. Project checkouts and remote commits seems to be faster. Even though on the face of it Subversion should be much faster at least for checkouts (Git gets the entire history, Subversion gets a single revision).     People keep mentioning having private commits as an advantage. I guess I see the point, but I am not sold on that yet. Sure, it is fun to be able to do that, but this is a paper advantage so far. What I really do like is that commits are fast. Which means that in many cases I can commit &amp; push on the background while resuming work.    Github is another consideration, its major advantage is that it is taking care of a lot of details related to actually managing git.   For open source work, I love looking at this:     This gives me a good indication about the actual interest in a project.   Other things, like pull requests and their management makes me tingle all over, since they represent how people actually work in OSS project in real life and this represent a significant time saving.  There are other stuff as well, having a download button in the site means that I don&#x2019;t get questions from people that have no Subversion tools or are behind firewalls.  Github is also a huge disadvantage since in less than a week I caught it broken at least twice. There are some things that I want to be stable, the place where I put my source code is one of them, and I don&#x2019;t care if the unstable parts aren&#x2019;t the Git repositories. As far as I am concerned, unstable site equals to nervousness on my part.  Anyway, those are my reasons for moving to Git. The tooling are pretty good, I got used to the git command line, gitk and git gui fairly quickly.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">NH Prof just went for a feature freeze in preparation for a release.  This means that sometimes next week, the v1.0 release will go up. To be rather more exact, the v1.0 is out as far as the bits are concerned. Build 414 is going to be it, unless people find some big bugs in it.  There are two main reasons for the delay.      No one likes to have to push out a v1.0.1 release, so it is better to play it safe.    For the beta period, a full license of NH Prof was offered with a 30% beta discount.    With the formal release, this beta discount is going away, and buyers will have to pay the full price. I think it is only fair to give potential buyers some heads up warning about this.  So, sometimes during the next week, I&#x2019;ll formally change everything to show as v1.0 and remove the beta sticker from the site.   The beta discount will be discontinued on Friday, September 11th.  Just as a reminder, there is no difference between a beta license and a standard v1.0 license, so if would like to get NH Prof, buying it before the 11th will save you 30%.  I&#x2019;ll have a more detailed post about NH Prof and its capabilities, in a few days, since I think that recently I always spoke only about a specific feature, not about the whole thing.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Well, now that Rhino Mocks 3.6 is out of the way, we need to think about what the next version will look like.  Initially, I thought to match Rhino Mocks 4.0 to the .NET 4.0 release and support mocking dynamic variables, but while this is still on the planning board, I think that it is much more important to stop and take a look at where Rhino Mocks is now and where we would like it to be.  I started Rhino Mocks about 5 years ago, and the codebase has stood well in the test of time. There aren&#x2019;t any nasty places and we can keep releasing new features with no major issues.  However, 5 years ago the community perception of mocking was different than what it is now. Rhino Mocks hasn&#x2019;t really changed significantly since it 1.1 days, for that matter, you can take a code base using Rhino Mocks for .Net 1.1 and move it to Rhino Mocks 3.6 with no issues.  But one of the most frequent complaints that I have heard is that Rhino Mocks API has became too complex over the years, there are too many options and knobs that you can turn. I know that my own style of interaction testing has changed as well.   The current plan for Rhino Mocks 4.0 is that we will break backward compatibility in a big way. That means that we are going to drastically simplify everything in the framework.   We are still discussing this in the mailing list, but currently it looks like we will go with the following route:     Kill the dynamic, strict, partial and stub terminology. No one cares. It is a fake.    Remove the record / playback API. The AAA method is much simpler.    Simplify mocking options, aiming at moving as much as possible from expectation style to assert style.    Keep as much of the current capabilities as we can. That means that if Rhino Mocks was able to support a scenario, it should still support it for the 4.0 version, hopefully in a simpler fashion.   The end result is putting Rhino Mocks on an API diet. I am looking for help in doing this, both in terms of suggested syntax and in terms of actual patches.  You are welcome to contribute&#x2026;</p>
