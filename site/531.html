            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">At a client site, I found the following in all the mapping files:     &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;&#xA;&lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns=&quot;urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2&quot; default-lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;class name=&quot;Machine&quot; table=&quot;Machines&quot; lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;id name=&quot;Id&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;generator class=&quot;identity&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/id&gt;&#xA;        &lt;property name=&quot;Name&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;set name=&quot;Parts&quot; table=&quot;Parts&quot; lazy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&#xA;            &lt;key column=&quot;BlogId&quot;/&gt;&#xA;            &lt;one-to-many class=&quot;Part&quot;/&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/set&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/class&gt;&#xA;&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;I think that you can figure out by now what is wrong. It is too bad that the &lt;blink/&gt; tag has gone out of use, because that would be an accurate reflection of how I responded when I saw that. After I finished frothing at the mouth, I explained that you never ever do things like, because it leads to pain, mayhem and tears. &#xA;&#xA;The lead dev heard me out, then explained that their situation wasn&#x2019;t a standard web application, their server had some business functionality, but it served mainly as a way for clients to come in and get some data. The architecture looks like this:&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&#xA;As you can imagine, NHibernate is sitting in the Application tier, but a lot of the work is done on the smart client application.&#xA;&#xA;The lead dev explained that in their scenario, they needed to send the full entity to the smart client app, so they didn&#x2019;t want lazy loading. Their scenario also precluded the need to do lazy loading over the network, so all was good, and they made the decision to use lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D; intentionally. Their model was pretty good about not having deeply connected object graphs, too.&#xA;&#xA;I hit Google and searched for the relevant posts:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  ayende strippers &#x2013; Which leads to the post: The Stripper Pattern. &#xA;&#xA;  castrate ayende * &#x2013; Which leads to the post: Don&#x2019;t castrate your architecture &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;* Googling that made me very nervous.&#xA;&#xA;I include the search terms as a reminder to myself that post titles are important, because that is how I search for them after the fact. And I got some really strong (and strange) looks when I did that.&#xA;&#xA;After we discussed that we put it aside and moved to other topics. Until we came to the part where we profiled the system.&#xA;&#xA;We immediately found some trouble spots that we needed to resolve. One of them was getting a list of machines that required fixing.&#xA;&#xA;The problem was that the code looked something like this:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  public IEnumerable&lt;Machine&gt; GetMachinesRequiringFixes()&#xA;{&#xA;    return (from machine in session.Linq&lt;Machine&gt;()&#xA;           where machine.Status == Statuses.Broken&#xA;           select machine).Take(10);&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Looks easy, right?&#xA;&#xA;Except that this seemingly innocent piece of code was responsible for 400 queries.&#xA;&#xA;What went wrong? How could loading 10 machines result in that many queries?&#xA;&#xA;Well, let us look what NHibernate did, shall we?&#xA;&#xA;select top 10 * from Machines where Status = &#x27;Broken&#x27;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;This gives NHibernate ten machines instances, except that when NHibernate investigate the mapping for a Machine, it realizes that it needs to load the Parts collection, since it was marked lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, so NHibernate will execute ten queries for loading each Machine&#x2019;s Parts.&#xA;&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 40&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 41&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 42&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 43&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 44&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 45&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 46&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 47&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 48&#xA;select * from Parts where MachineId = 49&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;But each Part also has an association for a MaintenanceHistory, which was also marked lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, so NHibernate had to load those as well. (I&#x2019;ll spare you that one :-) ).&#xA;&#xA;From the client perspective, Machine,Parts &amp; Maintenance History where all part of the same entity, and they wanted to be able to be able return that to the user in a single call. (More on that fallacy in my next post).&#xA;&#xA;The problem is that when you set lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, you literally ties NHibernate&#x2019;s hands. Now, you could start playing with the fetch mode option, to change that to join or subselect, but the problem is that this works when you have only one collection association (in the entire graph), because otherwise you run into sever Cartesian products issues.&#xA;&#xA;Now, NHibernate has the ability to handle just that scenario, but by setting lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D;, you prevent NHibernate from having the chance to actually utilize them.&#xA;&#xA;There is a good reason why lazy is set to true by default, and while I am sure that there is some limited number of scenarios where lazy=&#x201D;false&#x201D; is the appropriate choice, it isn&#x2019;t for your scenario.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just read a very insightful post from Evan Nagle about the topic. In it, Evan hit a key point:     Technically (and commercially) speaking, Microsoft has a slew of perfectly legitimate reasons for splattering the landscape with these &quot;watered down&quot; technologies. But, culturally speaking, it&#x27;s painful to the professional Microsoft developer. It is. Because the Microsoft developer&#x27;s personal and professional identity is tied up in the Microsoft stack, and that stack is now catering to a bunch of cat ladies and acne-laden teenagers. That&#x27;s the real issue here.   If Microsoft thinks that they can get the market for bad developers, good for them. But that needs to be highly segmented. It should be clear that going with that route is leading you to a walled garden and that writing real apps this way is not good. The best comparison I can think of is Access apps in the 90s. There was a clear separation between &#x201C;just wanna write some forms over data app over the weekend&#x201D; and &#x201C;I want to build a real application&#x201D;. When you built an app in Access, you had very clear idea about the limitations of the application, and you knew that if you wanted something more, it would be a complete re-write.  That was a good thing, because it meant that you could do the quick &amp; dirty things, but when things got messy, you knew that you had to make the jump.  The problem with things like Microsoft.Data is that there is no such line in the sand. And when you call it &#x201C;Microsoft.*&#x201D; you give it a seal of approval for everything. And when you have a piece of code that is explicitly designed to support bad coding practices, it is like peeing in the pool. If there is only one pool, it is going to affect everyone. There wouldn&#x2019;t be nearly as much objection if it was called WebMatrix.Data, because that would clearly put it in someone else&#x2019;s pool, and it that turn into a putrid swamp, I don&#x2019;t really care.   There is another issue here, and it is not just that the community is afraid of inheriting horrible Microsoft.Data projects. It is much more than that.   Salary data is from the UK, because that is the first site I found with the numbers)     C# average salary: &#xA3;42,000    VB.NET average salary: &#xA3;34,000   Now, I really can&#x2019;t think of a good technical reason why VB.Net programmers are paid so much less, but those data points match what I have seen about salaries for developers in both positions.  In other words, VB.Net developers are getting paid a lot less for doing the same job.  Now, why is that? Is it because of the legacy of VisualBasic still haunts the VB guys? Because there is still the impression that VB is a toy language? I don&#x2019;t know, but I think that at least in part, that is true. And that is what happen when a platform gets a reputation for being messy. People know in their bones that building stuff there is going to be costly, because maintaining this stuff is so hard.   Microsoft has repeatedly stated that they are after the people who currently go to PHP. Let me do the same comparison:     PHP average salary: &#xA3;32,500    Ruby average salary: &#xA3;45,000    Python average salary: &#xA3;47,500   I don&#x2019;t like those numbers. I really don&#x2019;t like them.   Put simply, if Microsoft attempts to make the .NET platform more approachable for the PHP guys, it is also going to devalue the entire platform. I am pretty sure that this is something that they don&#x2019;t want. Having a lot of hobbist programmer but fewer professional ones is going to hurt the Microsoft eco system.  Microsoft, if you want to create a PHP haven in the .NET world, that is great, but make sure that it is completely isolated, because otherwise you are going to hurt everyone who has a commercial stake in your platform.  I think that there is a lot of sense from commercial point of view in WebMatrix, but it should be clear that this isn&#x2019;t .NET programming, this is WebMatrix programming. So if Microsoft succeed in gaining market share for this, it won&#x2019;t be the .NET developers who would suddenly look at a 30% less money, it would be WebMatrix developers who would have to carry that stigma.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just saw this post, and I had to double check the date of the post twice to be sure that I am reading about something that is going to come out soon, rather than something that have come out in 2002.  This is the code that is being proudly presented as an achievement:     using (var db = Database.Open(&quot;Northwind&quot;)) {&#xA;    foreach (var product in db.Query(&quot;select * from products where UnitsInStock &lt; 20&quot;)) {&#xA;        Response.Write(product.ProductName &#x2B; &quot; &quot; &#x2B; product.UnitsInStock);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;Allow me to give you the exact statements used:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  The user doesn&#x2019;t have to learn about connection strings or how to create a command with a connection and then use a reader to get the results. Also, the above code is tied to Sql Server since we&#x2019;re using specific implementations of the connection, command, and reader(SqlConnection, SqlCommand, SqlDataReader).&#xA;&#xA;  Compare this with code below it. We&#x2019;ve reduced the amount of lines required to connect to the database, and the syntax for accessing columns is also a lot nicer, that&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re taking advantage of C#&#x2019;s new dynamic feature.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;I really don&#x2019;t know where to start. Yes, compared to raw ADO.Net I guess that this is improvement. But being beaten only thrice a week instead of daily is also an improvement. &#xA;&#xA;I mean, seriously, are you freaking kidding me? Are you telling me that you are aiming to make the life of people writing code like this easier? &#xA;&#xA;We have direct use of Response.Write &#x2013; because it is so hard to create maintainable code, we decided to just give up from the get go. Beyond that, putting SQL directly in the code like that, including the parameters, is an open invitation for SQL injection.&#xA;&#xA;Next, let us talk seriously, okay. Anyone who had to write ADO.Net code already wrapped it up. Anyone who didn&#x2019;t isn&#x2019;t going to.&#xA;&#xA;But given all the times that we have heard &#x201C;no resources to fix XYZ&#x201D; from Microsoft, are you telling me that creating a framework that is intended for really bad programmers to slide down the maintainability scale more easily? Is that a valuable use of resources?&#xA;&#xA;Writing code like that is actively harmful, period. There is really no need to deal with those low level stuff in this day and age.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This came in as a comment for my post about encapsulating DALs:     Just for the sake of DAL - what if I want to persist my data in another place, different than a relational database? For instance, in a object-oriented database, or just serialize the entities and store them somewhere on the disk... What about then ? NHibernate cannot handle this situation, can it ? Wouldn&#x27;t I be entitled to abstract my DAL so that it can support such case ?   The problem here is that it assume that such a translation is even possible.   Let us take the typical Posts &amp; Comments scenario. In a relational model, I would model this using two tables. Now, let us say that I have the following DAL operations:     GetPost(id)     GetPostWithComments(id)     GetRecentPostsWithCommentCount(id)    The implementation of this should be pretty obvious on a relational system.   But when you move to a document database, for example, suddenly this &#x201C;abstract&#x201D; API becomes an issue.  How do you store comments? As separate documents, embedded in the post? If they are embedded in the post, GetPost will now have the comments, which isn&#x2019;t what happens with the relational implementation. If they are separate documents, you complicated the implementation of GetPostWithComments, and GetRecentPostsWithCommentCount now have a SELECT N&#x2B;1 problem.  Now, to be absolutely clear, you can certainly do that, there are fairly simple solutions for that, but this isn&#x2019;t how you would build the system if you started from a document database standpoint.  What you would end up with in a document database design is probably just:     GetPost(id)     GetRecentPosts(id)    Things like methods for eagerly loading stuff just don&#x2019;t happen there, because if you need to eagerly load stuff, they are embedded in the document.  Again, you can make this work, but you end up with a highly procedural API that is very unpleasant to work with. Consider the Membership Provider API as a good example of that. The API is a PITA to work with compared to APIs that don&#x2019;t need to work to the lowest common denominator.  When talking about data stores, that usually means limit yourself to key/value store operations, and even then, there is stuff that leaks through. Let me show you an example that you might be familiar with:     The MembershipProvider is actually a good example of an API that try to fit several different storage systems. It has a huge advantage from the get go because it comes with two implementations for two different storage systems (RDBMS and ActiveDirectory).   Note the API that you have, not only is it highly procedural, but it can also assume nothing about its implementation. It makes for code that is highly coupled to this API and to this form of working with data in procedural fashion. This make it much harder to work with compared to code using a system that enable automatic change tracking and data store synchronization (pretty much every ORM).  That is one problem of such APIs, it greatly increase the cost of working with it. Another problem is that stuff still leaks through.  Take a look at the GetNumberOfUsersOnline method. That is a method that can only be answered efficiently on a relational database. The ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider just didn&#x2019;t implement this method, because it isn&#x2019;t possible to answer that question from ActiveDirectory.  By that same token, you can&#x2019;t implement FindUsersByEmail, FindUsersByName on a key/value store (well, you can maintain a reverse index, of course), nor can you implement GetAllUsers.  You can&#x2019;t abstract the nature of the underlying data store that you use, it is going to leak through. The issues isn&#x2019;t so much if you can make it work, you usually can, the issue is if you can make it work efficiently. Typical problems that show up is that you try to map concepts that simply do not exists in the underlying data store.  Relations is a good example of something that it is very easy to do in SQL but very hard to do using almost anything else. You can still do that, of course, but now your code is full of SELECT N&#x2B;1 and you can waive goodbye to your performance. If you build an API for a document database and try to move it to a relational one, you are going to get hit with &#x201C;OMG! It takes 50 queries to save this entity on a database, and 1 request to save it on a DocDb&#x201D;, leaving aside the problem that you are also going to have problems reading it from a relational database (the API would assume that you give back the full object).  In short, abstractions only work as long as you can assume that what you are abstracting is roughly similar. Abstracting the type of the relational database you use is easy, because you are abstracting the same concept. But you can&#x27;t abstract away different concepts. Don&#x2019;t even try.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Package management for .NET has long been an issue. I won&#x2019;t rehash the story, but you can read about a lot of the problems here.  There has been several attempts to replicate the success of Gems in Ruby, but none has really taken hold. Dru Sellers &amp; Rob Reynolds had decided to take a slightly different approach. Instead of trying to replicate Ruby&#x2019;s gems, just use them.  That is how Nu was created (and I really want to know what that name was picked, I nearly titled this post Dr. No). Before you can use Nu, you need to install it, which means that you have to make the following one time steps:     Install Ruby (you can also use Iron Ruby, but the Ruby installer is just sweet &amp; painless).    gem install nu   Once this is done, all you need to do to install a piece of software is just write:     nu install rhino.mocks    nu install nhibernate   And Nu will get the latest version (including resolving dependencies) and put them in your lib folder.  After executing the two commands above, I have the following contents in my lib directory.     castle.core    castle.dynamicproxy2    log4net    nhibernate    rhino.mocks   I like it, it is going to make things so much simpler!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got a question about the feasibility of porting Rhino Queues to Silverlight, but that isn&#x2019;t really something that can fit in that scenario. So I set down to write the design for a Silverlight queuing system. Just to be clear, I have no intention currently to actually build this at this time (well, not unless someone is willing to pay for it or I get a project that requires it). This is merely a way to get the design problem off my head.  Why can&#x2019;t we just port Rhino Queues to Silverlight?  There are two reasons, one is technical, the second relates to the different way that Silverlight applications are used. The first problem is that Rhino Queues requires a way to listen to incoming messages, but Silverlight offers no way of doing such (reasonably so, FWIW, since that would turn the Silverlight app to a server, and there are probably security issues with that).  The second problem is simply that the way most Silverlight solutions are structured, there is going to be a WAN between the Silverlight app and the server, and WAN between each client. Direct connections between the Server &amp; Silverlight client is likely to be possible only when using HTTP, and there isn&#x2019;t going to be any direct communication between different clients.  This usually looks something like this:     Rhino Queues is built on the notion of independent agents, each of them containing a full queuing stack. That model will not work for Silverlight. In Silverlight, we need to support all the usual queuing features, but each agent (Silverlight application) is no longer independent.  The Silverlight Queues model will be slightly different. We introduce a Queues server component which will hold the queues &amp; messages internally.      On the client side, the process of sending messages is:     Queues.Send(&#x201C;server&#x201D;, &#x201C;Orders&#x201D;, new Buy{ &#x2026; });    Message is saved to isolated storage    A background thread send the messages from isolated storage to the Queues server.   The process of receiving messages is:     A background thread periodically pools (an alternative is a Comet using something like WebSync) the server for new messages.    Messages are written to isolated storage    The Silverlight acknowledge the receipt of the messages.   There are some twists here, though.  In a Silverlight application, there are going to be several possible use cases:     Each Silverlight application has its own &#x201C;queue&#x201D; in the Queues server. That allows a one-way messaging platform with point to point notification. That is likely to be common in Silverlight applications that handle business transactions.     Topics, in addition to a queue per client, we might also want to allow subscription to topics, for example, I may be interested in getting notifications when the system settings have changed. That is something that is shared among all (or a lot) of clients. The Queues server should support this as well.   An interesting approach to make the Queues server even more stateless is to remove the process of acknowledgement and change it to &#x201C;give me all messages after&#x2026;&#x201D;  Yes, I know that this is a very high level design, but there really isn&#x2019;t much here that I can call very complex.  How much interest is there in Queuing system in Silverlight?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a question that I get routinely, both from random strangers and when I am at clients.     I would like to design a system/application using NHibernate. But I also want to so flexible that in future ,if I unplug the NHibernate and use ADO.NET Entity framework or other framework then my application should not       crash.   In short, I am completely opposed for even trying doing something like that.  It is based on flawed assumptions  A lot of the drive behind this is based on the historical drive built in the time where data access layers directly accessed a database using its own dialect, resulting in the need to create just such an encapsulation in order to support multiple databases.  The issue with this drive is that it is no longer a factor, all modern OR/Ms can handle multiple databases effectively. Moreover, modern OR/M are no longer just ways to execute some SQL and get a result back, which is how old style DAL were written. An OR/M takes on a lot more responsibilities, from things like change tracking to cache management, from ensuring optimistic concurrency&#xA0; to managing optimal communication with the database.  And those features matter, a lot. Not only that, but they are different between each OR/M.  It doesn&#x2019;t work, and you&#x2019;ll find that out too late  The main problem is that no matter how hard you try, there are going to be subtle and not so subtle differences between different OR/Ms, those changes can drastically affect how you build your application.  Here are a few examples, using NHibernate and EF.                     Feature          NHibernate          Entity Framework                        Futures          Yes          No                        Batching          Yes          No                        Transaction handling          Requires explicit code          Implicitly handled                        Caching          1st &amp; 2nd level caching          1st level caching only               This isn&#x2019;t intended to be a NH vs. EF, and it doesn&#x2019;t even pretend to be unbiased, I am simply pointing out a few examples of features that you can take advantage of which can greatly benefit you in one situation, which do not exists in another.  It has a high cost  In order to facilitate this data access encapsulation, you have to do one of two things:     Use the lowest common denominator, preventing you from using the real benefits of the OR/M in question.     Bleed those features through the DAL, allowing you to make use of those features, but preventing you from switching at a later time.    Either of those add complexity, reduce flexibility and creates confusion down the road. And in general, it still doesn&#x2019;t work.  There are other barriers than the API  Here is an example from a real client, which insists on creating this encapsulation and hiding NHibernate inside their DAL. They run into the previously mentioned problems, where there are NHibernate features specifically designed to solve some of their problems, but which they have hard time to implement through their DAL.  Worse, from the migration perspective, most of the barrier for moving from NHibernate isn&#x2019;t in the API. Their entity model make a heavy use on NHibernate&#x2019;s &lt;any/&gt; feature, which large percentage other OR/Ms do not support. And that is merely the example that spring most forcibly to mind, there are others.  The real world doesn&#x2019;t support it, even for the simplest scenarios  A while ago I tried porting the NerdDinner application to NHibernate. Just to point it out, that application have a single entity, and was designed with a nice encapsulation between the data access and the rest of the code. In order to make the port, I had to modify significant parts of the codebase. And that is about the simplest example that can be.  The role of encapsulation  Now, I know that some people would read this as an attack of encapsulation of data access, but that isn&#x2019;t the case. By all mean, encapsulate to your heart&#x2019;s content. But the purpose of this encapsulation is important. Trying to encapsulate to make things easier to work with, great. Trying to encapsulate so that you can switch OR/Ms? Won&#x2019;t work, will be costly and painful.  So how do you move between OR/Ms?  There are reasons why some people want to move from one data access technology to the other. I was involved in several such efforts, and the approach that we used in each of those cases was porting, rather than trying to drop a new IDaataAccess implementation.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just finish touching up a new feature for EF Prof, support for Entity Framework&#x2019;s Code Only feature. What you see below is EF Prof tracking the Code Only Nerd Dinner example:     I tried to tackle the same thing in CTP3, but I was unable to resolve it. Using CTP4, it was about as easy as I could wish it.  Just for fun, the following screen shot looks like it contains a bug, but it doesn&#x2019;t (at least, not to my knowledge). If you can spot what the bug is, I am going to hand you a 25% discount coupon for EF Prof. If you can tell me why it is not a bug, I would double that.  As an aside, am I the only one that is bothered by the use of @@IDNETITY by EF? I thought that we weren&#x2019;t supposed to make use of that. Moreover, why write this complex statement when you can write SELECT @@IDENTITY?</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most common issues that I run into in my work is getting all sort of questions which sound really strange. For example, I recently got a question that went something like this:     What is the impact of reflection on NHibernate&#x2019;s performance?   I started to answer that there isn&#x2019;t one that you would notice, even beyond the major optimizations that NH had in that role, you are accessing a remote database, which is much more expensive. But then they told me that they profiled the application and found some stuff there about that.  I asked them what their scenario was, and the exchange went like that:     Well, when we load a million rows&#x2026;   And that is your problem&#x2026;  To be fair, they actually had a reasonable reason to want to do that. I disagree with the solution that they had, but it was a reasonable approach to the problem at hand.</p>
