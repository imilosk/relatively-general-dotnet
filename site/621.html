            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">On of the things that I like most about conference is that they are the place to meet and exchange a whole boat load of ideas with a large number of people. Most of the time, this is actually done on a normal level, just far more frequently than usually happen. Just this is a reason enough to visit conferences.  Sometimes, however, you get into a conversation that really open your mind. That is what Aslam Khan managed to do to me in about five minutes of hallway conversation. This short talk literally opened up for me a whole new way of thinking about the utilization of aspects and other behavioral patterns. I am going to try explaining this in this post. Aspects are a way to add behavior to an object. Usually we are talking about being able to add pre and post actions to method calls on the fly. Aspects are commonly used to handle cross cutting infrastructure concerns. The typical examples are: logging, transactions, security and caching. In the past, I have put domain logic in aspects, and has come to regret it very much, to the point where I believed that the only reason to use aspects is to handle cross cutting infrastructure concerns. Aslam changed my view on that. Let us take the typical bank account example, with the Withdraw method. Ideally, I want the Withdraw method to contain just the core logic relating to its operation, so it would look something like this: public virtual Status Withdraw(Money money)&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;ammountInAccount -= money;        return Status.Success;&#xA;}&#xA;However, what is going to happen when we have the following business role?&#xA;&#xA;You may not withdraw from the account in the first week after is was opened, you may only deposit.&#xA;As usual, stupid business rule, but the example doesn&#x27;t matter. The question is, where does this behavior belongs? Something that you should take into account is that there are likely to be many such rules, and any answer that you give should handle this scenario gracefully.&#xA;According to Aslam, the answer for this is in an aspect. Something like this:&#xA;public class MayNotWithdrawFromAccountOnFirstWeek : AnAspectOf&lt;Account&gt; // this is invoked on Account.Withdraw method&#xA;{&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;public override void BeforeExecution()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;if( (DateTime.Now - Entity.DateCreated).Days &gt; 7 )&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;ReturnValue = Status.ActionCancelled;&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;This allow to maintain both the single responsibility principle and create clean separation between the core entity behavior and extended behavior, which is usually implemented in a service layer somewhere.&#xA;My first thought when I heard this (I have a deep rooted suspicion of aspects for domain logic, remember) is that I want to make this explicit, so have something like the entity publish some sort of event that the container can route to all subscribers. Thinking about this further, I realize that the code to actually raise the event is exactly the kind of cross cutting technological concern that I want to use an aspect for anyway.&#xA;I am not sure about the implications of this technique, but it resonates very well with my JFHCI notion.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In response to Davy&#x27;s post about the rise of interesting in NHibernate,I decided to run the numbers.  Nine months ago we created the NHibernate Users, which has taken off quite nicely, with over thousand members and a very active community.   For that matter, the stats for NHibernate downloads are quite nice as well.    The dip just toward the end is just before we released NHibernate 2.0. Awesome!</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I am writing this in a bar in Malmo. Sitting with a bunch of guys and discussing software methodologies. I had an observation that I really feel that I should share.&#xA;&#xA;Most software methodologies are making a lot of implicit assumptions. The most common implicit assumption is that the people working on the software are Good people. That is, people who care, know how and willing to do.&#xA;&#xA;This work, quite well, in the early adopters phase, since most early adopters trend toward these set of qualities anyway. The problem is when the early adoption phase is over, and the methodologies hit the main stream. At this point, the implicit assumption about Good people no longer hold true.&#xA;&#xA;Just to annoy Scott Bellware, here is a big problem that I can find with Lean just from the things that I heard about Lean from him. Toyota hires the top 2% of the engineers that they interview. A lot of the methodology assume a competent team, or at the very least, a competent chief engineer.&#xA;&#xA;I don&#x27;t think that I need to state that competency is not universal.&#xA;&#xA;If your methodology assumes competence, and most of the methodologies that we (as in I and like minded people) would find favorable do assume competence, it is going to fail in the treches.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Quite often, people remark to me that I set unreasonable time estimates for work because I am somehow much better than anyone else. I strongly disagree with this statement. Both the qualitative assessment of my skills, and that this is an unreasonable timeframe.&#xA;There are several things that I am doing that I think that people are ignoring. One of them is not starting from zero, but starting already at high speed. But that isn&#x27;t the major thing here. The major thing is that people fail to notice what I am giving those estimates very well defined things. You want to build an IoC container? It takes less than ten minutes to build a useful container. And I built an application on top of a container that wasn&#x27;t much more complex than that.&#xA;That isn&#x27;t a good IoC tool by any means, but it took very little time to build, and it works. If you click the link to see the container code, the container whose code you are reading is going to be involved in serving the code. It works and it fits to purpose.&#xA;That is a major thing to remember. A lot of the really useful concepts are trivially simple to build if what you need is a very simple. You can do that in a day.&#xA;And I include in this concepts such as OR/M, Aspect Orientation, IoC, Logging, Hot Code Swapping, Message Buses, Search Engines, Event Brokers and many other basic infrastructures.&#xA;The catch is that in a day, you get something that works, for the scenario that you need it for. If you want to take it to the next level, however, this requires a much higher degree of investment.&#xA;Coming back to the title of this post, you either do it in a day, or you dedicate three months for it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had a (great) talk yesterday, introducing Active Record. During this talk, I reused Jeremy&#x27;s statements about data access. If you write data access code, you are stealing from your client.&#xA;Frans Bouma puts it beautifully:&#xA;&#xA;  No customer should accept that the team hired for writing the line-of-business application has spend time on writing a report-control or for example a grid control. So why should a customer accept to pay for time spend on other plumbing code? Just because the customer doesn&#x27;t know any better? If so, isn&#x27;t that erm... taking advantage of the inability of the customer to judge what the &#x27;software guys&#x27; did was correct?&#xA;&#xA;The context for Frans&#x27; post was a design decision from the Entity Framework team. I read Frans&#x27; post first, and I didn&#x27;t quite know how to react to it, until I saw what the proposed design is. You can read the entire EF post here, but I&#x27;ll try to summarize it so you can actually understand the point without going and reading the whole thing.&#xA;The problem is supporting change tracking in disconnected scenarios. In particular, you take an object from the database and send it to the presentation layer, some time later, you get the object from the presentation layer and persist it to the database again. There is a whole host of bad practices and really bad design decisions that are implicit in the problem statement, but we will leave that alone for now.&#xA;This is still a pretty common scenario, and it is more than reasonable that you would want your data access approach to support this.&#xA;Here is how you do this using NHibernate:&#xA;&#xA;  session.Merge( entityFromPresentationLayer );&#xA;&#xA;Frans&#x27; LLBLGen support a very similar feature. In other words, it is the business of the data access framework to do this, none of the developer&#x27;s business to do any such thing.&#xA;The current proposed EF design problem can be summarized in a single line.&#xA;&#xA;  context.ChangeRelationship(&#xA;  customer1,&#xA;  order1,&#xA;  c=&gt;c.Orders, &#xA;  EntityState.Added);&#xA;&#xA;This is code that you as the user of EF, is supposed to write.&#xA;If you write this type of code, you are stealing from your client.&#xA;This design violates the Infrastructure Responsibility Principle: Developers doesn&#x27;t write infrastructure code for supported scenarios.&#xA;In other words, it is okay not to support a feature, but it is not okay to say that this is how you are supporting a feature.&#xA;This Is Broken, By Design</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I spent a great day at the Oredev conference, and even a greater evening.&#xA;It started with a full day in the ALT.Net track, in which we agreed that ALT.Net shouldn&#x27;t actually exist, and the main purpose of ALT.Net is to change its nature from alternative practices to merely a label for the set of principles and practices that we believe in.&#xA;I think that the name ALT.Net will change its meaning in the near to medium future, and change from being alternative to being an alternative to the mainstream .Net culture to subsuming the .Net culture, at least the high end of it. At that point, I think that ALT.Net will no longer be alternative, but the actual name will still be used as a label for this set of practices that ALT.Net currently represent.&#xA;Moving on from there, we (me, Glenn and Scott) had a great dinner, followed by several hours at a bar, just talking with speakers and attendees from Oredev.&#xA;I don&#x27;t know if I mentioned it already, but just about everyone I met so far is very friendly.&#xA;After spending several hours in a pleasant conversation over bear in the bar, we got kicked out (something that seem to happen to me regularly now), so a bunch of guys (and one gal) went to a night club. I will just hint that Scott Bellware and bicycles doesn&#x27;t add up in a coherent discussion.&#xA;The night club itself was great. Expect for Creepy Guy.&#xA;Let me put it this way, Creepy Guy made me think about date rape drugs and rectum reconstruction surgery. He made me extremely uncomfortable. I don&#x27;t think I would have liked the retired-cremationist anyway, but I haven&#x27;t had the chance to meet people as obnoxious and spooky as this guy in a long time.&#xA;Luckily, he was just one guy, and we were able to foster him off to a designated victim at a time. I blame the night club for my current state of non drunkness.&#xA;If I can still type in English, then I am not drunk.&#xA;Anyway, so far, I am really enjoying &#xD8;redev. I have two talks to give tomorrow, and it is now 3:30 AM local time, so I better lay off the laptop and get some sleep. If you are in &#xD8;redev, you might want to check my sessions for the amusement value alone.&#xA;Oh, and since I am going to be in DevTeach in a week or two, I dare the DevTeach attendees to get me drunker than that...</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Okay, Subtext is a great software, tested in the only real test that matter, in production. I am using it for a log time now, and it has given me very few problems, that is the hallmark of truly great software. It does what it needs to do, and it doesn&#x27;t bother the owner with the details.&#xA;Phil Haack, and the rest Subtext gang, has done a great job in creating a zero friction tool for blogging.&#xA;It is missing one thing, however, I would really like to have a breathalyzer test as an optional security measure for the blog. I don&#x27;t want to be able to post while I am drunk, something that seems to coincide with end of conference / end of a really good night at a conference.&#xA;I am sure that if you try to map the amount of controversy that my posts generate and correlate that to the end of conference times in which I took part, you would have pretty straightforward work.&#xA;As you can imagine, I deny being drunk at the moment. I am... slightly impaired in my thinking, perhaps, but I am not drunk.&#xA;I know that I am not drunk by the simple fact that I can type in English, without getting too much errors out.&#xA;Nevertheless, I think that such a feature would be a great addition to Subtext. I am pretty sure that tomorrow I am not going to be certain that I want this post out.</p>
