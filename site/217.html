            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For a long time, whenever I was talking to customers about the business domain, I would explicitly avoid using the term &#x201C;business logic&#x201D;. Primarily because I never found such things to be logical in any way shape or form. A lot of the business decisions and policies are driven by a host of legacy reasons, &#x201C;this is how everyone does it&#x201D; and behaviors that has became accepted and then entrenched.Take what is supposed to be a pretty simple rule. Given a warrant, when should an inmate be released? On the face of it, that seems like a pretty obvious and straightforward answer, right?Depending on the type of warrant (can be for 48 hours, 5 days, 30 months, 10 years, life) the answer is quite different. For example, if someone was arrested at 3 PM on Thursday on a 48 hours hold, he must be released on Saturday at 3 PM. But that is actually a problem, because the prison does not release inmates on Saturday. So the release date is moved back (or forward(!), depending on a lot of stuff). If an inmate is sentenced for life, that might mean that he is expected to die in prison, be released in 10 years, 25 years or be eligible to go on parole in 14 years and be effectively free. I did some research around sentencing rules around the world and I must say that this is confusing and quite sad. Even within a single legal system the amount of complexity, precedent, custom and variance is staggering. At any rate, we need to figure out something that seems to be quite simple. Given an inmate and the warrants we have on file, what should be the release date. This can be as simple as having a single warrant, or a series of sequential warrants (arrest, held until trial, sentencing, etc). That is simple and pretty obvious. Go to the latest warrant, get the duration from that and then start computing the release date. Here we have another problem, from what date do we start counting? If the inmate has been under arrest for the entire duration, then we start from that point. If the inmate has been free (bail, etc), then we start from the point he got put back into prison. Sometimes the inmate was held for a while (several months, before getting bail, for example), so that will be counted against the sentencing period (or not, depending on a bunch of stuff). In short, being told &#x201C;you are hereby sentenced to 10 years&#x201D; can mean several different release dates, even assuming nothing changes. So this is complex, and hard, and in many cases very much situational dependent. How do you approach handling this?To start with, this is one of those cases that you can, should and require to get a specification, complete with examples, test suite and samples, etc. It may sound silly, because all we are doing is computing a date, but the implications are&#x2026; important, especially for the people who are being held. The specification will have a few straightforward cases, but also a lot of convoluted mess that with luck, you can get a lawyer to decipher, but most likely not. The way to handle that is to recognize the patterns that you know that you can reliably figure out and provide answers to those. If it was up to me, I&#x2019;ll be producing a long hand report, like so:Note that this computation sheet is not the final say, instead, the Registration Office officer is going to sign on that, after having validated the dates independently.For patterns that aren&#x2019;t so easy to compute, a good way to handle that is to show the information you have and not give any answer, making the officer that will sign up on the correctness of this result do all the work.As an aside, printing this report, including the computation and how it was arrived is a really good idea because it can be handed to the inmate as well as to their attorney. At this point, presumably they&#x2019;ll double check the dates as well. This is important since a mistake in releasing an inmate that didn&#x2019;t happen yet is free. After all, if an inmate is supposed to walk out on 2022 but we computed the sentence until 2025 and it was discovered in 2018, no harm was done (except maybe to someone&#x2019;s nerves). The human in the loop model is quite important in this regard, because of the notion of the single responsibility that I previously mentioned. Someone, a person, in actually responsible for the release date computation, and that should probably be a human that isn&#x2019;t the system developer from a decade ago.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The inmate population in any typical prison is divided according to many and varying rules. It can be the length of expected stay, it can be the level of security required, the kind of facilities required, the crimes committed, etc. For simplicity, we&#x2019;ll talk about Block A (minimum security, good behavior, low risk) and Block C (bitter lifers, bad apples, violent inmates, etc) as our two examples. These differences can create&#xA0; very different environments. Things that would never pass muster in block A and routine in block C and vice versa.A good example would be the acceptance criteria, in order to be accepted to block A you have to meet certain standards (non violent offenders or 8 years inside with no spots on your records or strong recommendation from an officer). In order to be sent to block C you need to be in a particular kind of trouble (violent crime, recent behavioral issues, high risk from intelligence, etc).Being written up by a guard in block A will result in loss of privileges like not being sent to work, reduction in visitation, etc. You don&#x2019;t get written up in block C, you get sent to disciplinary action with the block&#x2019;s officer and can be confined to the cell, isolation, lose cafeteria privileges, etc. From the outside, both of these blocks are roughly the same, but from the inside, they have very different populations, behavior and accepted practices. This means that when we need to write a system that would serve both blocks (and there is also Block B, Isolation and the Medical Ward as well, all slightly different) we are in somewhat of a pickle. How do we account for all of these differences. One way to handle that would be to just deal with the common stuff (the counts, the legal dealing, etc) and let each block dictate policy outside of the system. We can also provide some &#x201C;note keeping&#x201D; functionality, such as the ability to assign tasks, keep notes and records on inmates and hope that the blocks would use that so we&#x2019;ll at least have a record of all these policy decisions.Alternatively, we can map what each block wants to do and customize the application for each of them. The problem here is that this things change, and when talking about a large enough basis, they change quite often. Given a typical tenure of a block&#x2019;s officer of about 3 &#x2013; 5 years (really depend on the type of prison, in some cases, you&#x2019;ll have tenures as short as a year or two) and the tendency of each new&#xA0; officer to want to make some changes (otherwise, why are they there?) and the fact that in a typical prison you&#x2019;ll have 3 &#x2013; 6 blocks and about 10 high level officers that each want to leave their mark (each with independent tenures), you end up with a fairly constant rate of low level changes.If this make you cringe at the expected number of changes that will be required to always adapt the system, I hear you, that isn&#x2019;t a fun place to be in.There are typically two major ways to handle this. Either you&#x2019;ll ensure that no such changes are accepted, by not making the changes and having the prison work around the different practices while still using the system or you plan to adapt things from the get go. The first option is very common in a top down organization, where the HQ wants to &#x201C;lay down the law&#x201D; about how things &#x201C;should be done&#x201D;. The other option is typically more expensive, sometimes ridiculously so, depending on how far you want to push it. Dynamic data, forms and behaviors, oh my! Let the prison guard completely re-design the system in his free time. To be fair, I was a prison guard and I would enjoy that, but I haven&#x2019;t found many people in my current career that can say that they have prison experience (from either side of the bars). In practical terms, I would say that the technical level of prison guards is at or below the population norm and not at a level sufficient to actually do anything mission critical such as dealing with people&#x2019;s freedom. It is actually usually quite easy to convince the HQ people to avoid any flexibility in the system. They like ensuring that things are done &#x201C;right&#x201D;, even if that is quite different from how things are actually working (or even can possibly work). But we&#x2019;ll avoid such power plays. Instead, let&#x2019;s talk about how we can limit the scope of the work that is required and still gain enough flexibility for most things.With RavenDB, defining dynamic data is both easy and obvious, so that is easy. Each block can define additional fields that they can tack onto documents and just have them there. The auto indexing features will also ensure that searches on such fields are fast and efficient. I&#x2019;m not going to touch on any UI elements, that is someone else&#x2019;s job .Let us talk about policy decisions. For example, we might need to decide whatever an inmate is acceptable or not for a block. That means that we need to have some way to decide policy. Now, I have literally written a book about building DSLs for just such a scenario. You can very quickly build something simple an elegant that would give the user the chance to define their own policy and behavior.In fact, given the target audience, this is not a good idea. We don&#x2019;t expect the prison guard to make such decisions, so we don&#x2019;t need to cater to them. Instead, we&#x2019;ll cater to developers, probably the same developers who are in charge of actually building and maintaining the system. This give us a very different flavor to deal with. For example, instead of building a DSL, we can just use a programming language.For example, we can use JavaScript to shell out at critical parts of the pipeline. A good example would be at the validation stage of processing an incoming inmate. We&#x2019;ll pass the inmate document to a JavaScript function and that can emit validation warnings and actions that are supposed to take place. Here is a small sample:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

This block accepts only inmates with final judements.&quot;);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;             }&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;             var violentCrimes = &quot;23.93.1&quot;; &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;             if(inmate.warrants.filter(w =&gt; w.reelvantClause === violentCrimes).length == 0) {&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;                warn(&quot;This inmate doesn&#x27;t have a history of violent crimes. Are you sure?!&quot;);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;             }&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          }&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          block-c.js&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;The real world would probably have several pages of various business logic around what should and shouldn&#x2019;t happen here. Including things like assigning to specific cell because of the inmate&#x2019;s affiliation, etc. The idea here is that we&#x2019;ll give the developers an easy way to go and modify the behavior of the system for each location this is deployed in.As an aside, this kind of things needs to be logged and audited. That means that you can store these scripts in something like a git repository and record the commit hash for the version you are using when you are making decisions. In 99.9% of the cases it will not matter, but if you&#x2019;ll need to show to court why the &#x201C;computer told us&#x201D; that a certain inmate had to be dealt with in a certain way, you want to be able to know what happened and produce the right script that help made that decision. You might also note from the script that the output of the function is a set of warnings, not errors or exceptions. Why is that? Because there is an explicit place here for the human element. That means that if we have warnings for an inmate, we can still actually accept the inmate, despite the warnings. We might require the sergeant to note why the inmate is accepted despite the warnings (and answers may be things such as &#x201C;they run out of room in B&#x201D; and &#x201C;he was overheard saying he would stab someone&#x201D;). This is because quite explicitly, we don&#x2019;t treat the system as the source of truth.This system is the system of record, it holds the information about what is going on, but it isn&#x2019;t meant to be rigid, it has to be flexible, because we are dealing with people and there is no way that we can cover all situations. So we try to ensure that there is a place for the human element throughout the system design.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">An interesting problem in distributed work shows up quite frequently in the prison space. Duplicated, delayed and repeated warrants (um&#x2026; I mean packets). This can lead to some issues, especially since the receiving parties may or may not be in communication with one another.Consider the case of a warrant to release a particular inmate. It is quite common for the process of actually getting the warrant back to the prison from the court to take a few hours. In that time frame, the inmate&#x2019;s lawyer has already arrived at the gates of the prison and handed the release warrant to the block&#x2019;s sergeant (it&#x2019;s a bit more complex than that, but I&#x2019;m skipping details here because I want to talk about the technical details of building a system to run a prison rather than the actual details of running a prison).At this point, the block&#x2019;s sergeant can pass the warrant off to the Registration Office, which will also accept the warrant from the court at some time in the future or they can initiate the release process directly. What actually happens depends on a lot of factors, but let&#x2019;s say that they start the release process directly. We already talked about what that would mean, so let&#x2019;s focus on another aspect of that. How do we deal with the arrival of the warrant to the Registration Office when there is already an open workflow to release the inmate.For fun, here is an brief example of a warrant:Yes, this is faxed, often unreadable and sometimes coffee stained. There is no such thing as a warrant id that you can use to check if the warrant has already been seen. There is supposed to be, at least per court / judge, but there often just isn&#x2019;t. Side note regarding the issue of faxing warrants. Yes, there have been cases where people just sent a release warrant and people got out. Part of the process of actually processing a release warrant is talking with the court to validate it, but that isn&#x2019;t always done.Another fun fact is that what one warrant may do another warrant may undo. So you may have a release warrant on hand, but the court has already issued a stay of 48 hours for that warrant so the police can appeal that, for example. If the second warrant doesn&#x2019;t arrive in time&#x2026;At any rate, the fact that a warrant may show up multiple times and that there may be conflicting warrants being processed at the same time means that there is the need to handle some level of de-duplication. We can usually detect that using the inmate&#x2019;s details and the date in which the warrant was issued (it is rare that multiple warrants for the same person are issued at the same date, so that is enough to flag things).&#xA0; If the result of two warrants on the same date is the same, we can assume that they are the same. If there are conflicts, this will raise a flag and require a human involvement to resolve it. A conflict will be raised for any non identical warrants for the same day for the same inmate, because any such activity is suspicious and require additional attention.Following the Single Responsibility Principle as applied to prison (there must be a single responsible party so we can put them in jail if they mess this up), the validation of warrants is at the hands of the Registration Office and they take care of handling all such warrants. Even if the warrant was served directly to the block&#x2019;s sergeant, the final validation (and responsibility) is on the Registration Office personal actually signing on the release form.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The whole point of having a prison is ensuring that the inmates are staying in. As such, the process of actually getting an inmate out of the prison is quite involved. I&#x2019;m using the release workflow as an obvious example, but there are many such workflows inside the prison that are similar. The inmate&#x2019;s intake workflow, or disciplinary workflows or even just inmate&#x2019;s transfers which can be quite complex (and typically also happen in big batches).In the previous post in this series, I talked briefly about the idea of workflows as an event publication with multiple signatories to the workflow operation. If this make no sense, let me try to explain. The trigger for starting an inmate&#x2019;s release can be the acceptance of a warrant for immediate release, the expiration of the warrant to hold the inmate. There are several other variants (transfer to another facility, death of inmate, escape of inmate, etc) that are related but are not too relevant for the discussion, so I&#x2019;ll just talk about the immediate release and the warrant expiration.For warrant expiration, the workflow starts from the Registration Office publishing the list of inmates that are supposed to be released today. In technical terms, they create a series of workflow documents that are in the Open state and this gets disseminated to the rest of the system. Immediate release warrant is usually served to the Registration Office, but may also be served directly to the block&#x2019;s sergeant. If the Registration Office got the immediate release warrant, things are identical as the usual scheduled release (except that this might be served at any time). However, if this is served to the block&#x2019;s sergeant, things are more interesting. At this point, it is the block that will initiate the workflow, but the overall responsibility for verifying the warrant and ensuring the actual release is still on the Registration Office. As an aside, the notion of &quot;who owns this&#x201D; is quite important in the prison. Mostly because if you mess up, there might be consequences. This can be holding an inmate past the due date (bad, can result in damages paid to the inmate and career consequences to the person who messed up) to releasing an inmate that wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be released (really bad, sometimes it is not possible / feasible to hold them again, requires court approval, may end up in jail time for the person who messed up and also result in possible dangerous inmate being released). So the idea is that at any time, there is an owner for this process and a clear finger pointing at that person, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re to blame&#x201D;. Because of this, there are typically multiple steps in the release process. Consider the simple scenario of a scheduled release, we have:Registering the inmate on the &#x201C;to be released&#x201D; list.Notifying external and internal parties about this inmate&#x2019;s pending release. For example, an inmate might have to go through a parole officer before actual release. This is done by sending the &#x201C;to be released&#x201D; list several days in advanced and getting at least an implicit agreement (by not vetoing / modifying the process) by external parties.Verification that there are no explicit holds on the inmate. In the case of an inmate that is supposed to be deported, the inmate&#x2019;s file will have an explicit &#x201C;deport on release&#x201D; which typically require coordinating with the border police to handle that. So the inmate can&#x2019;t just be shoved out the door but handed off to someone. Identification of the inmate at the block level. This is typically done on the sergeant&#x2019;s level and then by an officer (preferably from the same block) that are familiar with the inmate and can validate that this is indeed the one to be released.Checking out the inmate from the block level to the prison&#x2019;s level. This explicitly remove the inmate from the block&#x2019;s responsibility once the inmate has been handled off to the release queue.Identification of the inmate by the Registration Office&#x2019;s officer. This is a second verification that is done to ensure that there hasn&#x2019;t been a mix up again.Verification of the warrant to release the inmate and that there are no newer warrants that are in effect.Returning of personal affects and getting the inmate&#x2019;s signature that everything was properly returned.Checking the inmate out of the prison, this step explicitly ends the period in which the now ex-inmate is held in prison.Actually getting the newly released ex-inmate out of the prison. This can be to a family member at the gate or to a bus to the nearest city, etc.I&#x2019;m probably forgetting a few details in the middle, and there are branches for each and every one of these steps. In terms of the technical details of how this works. The workflow document is being distributed throughout the system, and then various parties are now in charge of actually completing the various tasks in the workflow. For example, this may mean checking out the inmate&#x2019;s personal affects from the safe in the morning, preparing for the release. So the steps aren&#x2019;t necessarily in sequence or ordered. The important thing is that the workflow document is published, and is now tracked. Typically, the release process is tracked by the Registration Office and the Command &amp; Control Center. The Command &amp; Control Center will typically be involved early in the process if an inmate isn&#x2019;t released by the typical time, and the close of day process for the Registration Office includes verification that there aren&#x2019;t any still pending inmate releases. At any given point, we can track the process of the workflow from any point in the system (remember, changes are made locally and then distributed to the rest of the system). In there is a communication issue between different parts of the prison, that will typically show up as an alert that a particular workflow hasn&#x2019;t been properly completed in the allotted time. At this point, external channel (walking &amp; talking, usually) is used to verify the status of this particular inmate release.</p>
