            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into the following Reddit&#x2019;s question: My client&#x27;s business sounds shady. Should I run away? And I thought it was very interesting. Here are the relevant details:I have a client who wants me to finish developing a web application for him. Basically, his application has 2 types of users, buyers and sellers. The buyers can create an account and upload money to the website which goes into my clients bank account. The amount of money they have to spend is then logged in the database as their &quot;available funds&quot;. The users can then purchase services from the sellers.The sellers, when they sell a product, earn some of the funds from the buyers. So no money actually gets transferred. The database just updates to say that the buyer now has x$ less available, and the seller has an extra x$ available.Eventually the seller can withdraw their money, at which point my client transfers it from his bank.The core of the issue is in a comment:Their funds that they have available is just represented as a number in a database, which himself and the developers have access to. If one wanted to, they could just log into the database, create their own seller account, load it up with funds, then withdraw from my clients bank account. Just one example.There are a few interesting things here that I want to touch, but this question was posted to a legal advice community, so I should probably preface anything I say with the fact that I&#x2019;m not a lawyer, merely doing professional software development for quite some time and have dealt numerous times with financial systems and projects. Today, except for the money that you physically carry in your wallet or stuffed under a mattress, pretty much all money is represented as numbers in some database. And there have been cases where this have been used for theft. However, it is very rarely going to be something as obvious as merely changing numbers around in a database.For example, let&#x2019;s imagine that, as the admin of the website web application above, I follow the doomsday scenario and create my own seller account. At this point, I don&#x2019;t need to move money around, I can just put 10,000,000 in the Amount field and ask for a withdrawal. It will likely work, after all. There is no need to balance the numbers. Of course, this assumes quite a few things:There is no governance on the outgoing money. I don&#x2019;t care what would happen after.The fun thing about money transfers in the real world is that for the most part, they are reversible. I once paid a supplier, but I hit an extra 0 and didn&#x2019;t notice that until I hit the Submit key. I called the bank and cancelled the order. Another time, I switched numbers in a wire transfer and sent money to the wrote account. It took a couple of months before we discovered the issue, but we were able to reconcile everything. It was annoying, but not too hard.The threat model here is also fairly strange. We have someone that is able to modify the data directly in the database, but can&#x2019;t also call: SendMoney(me, all) ? All of the reasons above are partly why no real financial system works in this manner. There is no single Amount field per customer and money being shuffled off between accounts using &#x2B; or &#x2013;. Instead, you always have a record of transactions.You might have heard about the embezzlement by fraction, right?&#xA0; A programmer will direct the remainder of the result (typically partial cents) to their own account. Why do we need such a thing? After all, if the programmer is already able to write code that would move money around, why just deal with fractional cents? The answer is that in every financial institution, you are going to have some sort of governance. You&#x2019;ll run a query / report and the total amount of money in and the total amount of money out should match. If it doesn&#x2019;t, you have a Big Problem and are going to have to do something about it.&#xA0; This is why all these systems work based on moving money around and not creating it out of thin air. Money transfers are easily tracked, monitored and carefully audited. Doing the sort of thing that was suggested in the Reddit question falls under: Embezzlement, Theft, Money Laundering, Tax Evasion and probably a host of other laws. It isn&#x2019;t some weird trick that you can get away with.Regardless, unless the system you build is intentionally meant to evade the law, I doubt that the developers building the system would have any issues. The people operating it, of course, need to be sure that they are operating within the law, but that shouldn&#x2019;t be an issue for the developers. After all, a photo sharing website is a perfectly innocent project, but can be used for several nefarious and illegal purposes. But if someone took Lychee to put up a site for a pig named Napoleon hosted on eu-west-3 (Paris), I doubt that would put the Lychee project in any legal trouble.The title of this post promised that I would talk about data modeling, so let&#x2019;s get to it, shall we? If you are still worried about the shadiness of your client, and assuming that you aren&#x2019;t worried about the possibility of the shady client not paying you, what can you do?The answer is simple, don&#x2019;t have anything like an Amount field in the system. Don&#x2019;t allow it to happen. Instead, build the system using the notion of monetary transactions. That is, every movement of money between accounts (deposit from outside, withdrawal or shifting balance between accounts) must be explicit recorded as such.Here is a very simple example:You can see the movement of the money, and the total amount that was deducted from the source account matches the deposit &#x2B; commission. With RavenDB, you can use a Map/Reduce index on top of this set of transactions to compute:How much money does each account has.That the total amount of money in the system balances out.Note that in this case, the numbers that you are working on are computed, there is no way to just move things around. Instead, you have to do that using an actual transaction, which will create a traceable record. To make things more robust, you can take things further. Make sure that on each transaction, you&#x2019;ll email all the clients involved. That will ensure that there is an external record of the transactions in the system, and they can recover their own account state independently.&#xA0; This will protect the customer in the case of the shady client trying to do things behind their back. They have their own separate record of all the going on in their account, separate from what is store on the potentially vulnerable database. These are fairly routine behaviors for most financial systems, and I can&#x2019;t imagine a client not wanting them. They&#x2019;ll also serve as a pretty good protection for the developers if there is shadiness involved.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I was pointed to this blog post which talks about the experience of using RavenDB in production. I want to start by saying that I love getting such feedback from our users, for a whole lot of reasons, not the least of which is that it is great to hear what people are doing with our database.Alex has been using RavenDB for a while, so he had the chance to use RavenDB 3.5 and 4.2, that is a good from my perspective, because means that he had the chance to see what the changes were and see how they impacted his routine usage of RavenDB. I&#x2019;m going to call out (and discuss) some of the points that Alex raise in the post. Speaking about .NET integration:Raven&#x2019;s .NET client API trumps MongoDB .NET Driver, CosmosDB &#x2B; Cosmonaut bundle and leaves smaller players like Cassandra (with DataStax C# Driver), CouchDB (with MyCouch) completely out of the competition.When I wrote RavenDB 0.x, way before the 1.0 release, it took two months to build the core engine, and another three months to build the .NET client. Most of that time went on Linq integration, by the way. Yes, it literally took more time to build the client than the database core. We put a lot of effort into that. I was involved for years in the NHibernate project and I took a lot of lessons from there. I&#x2019;m very happy that it shows.Speaking about technical support:RavenDB has a great technical support on Google Groups for no costs. All questions, regardless of the obtained license, get meaningful answers within 24 hours and quite often Oren Eini responds personally.Contrary to the Google Groups, questions on StackOverflow are often neglected. It&#x2019;s a mystery why Raven sticks to a such archaic style of tech support and hasn&#x2019;t migrated to StackOverflow or GitHub.I care quite deeply about the quality of our support, to the point where I&#x2019;ll often field questions directly, as Alex notes. I have an article on Linked In that talks about my philosophy in that regard which may be of interest. As to Alex&#x2019;s point about Stack Overflow vs Google Groups, the key difference is the way we can discuss things. In Stack Overflow, the focus is on an answer, but that isn&#x2019;t our usual workflow when providing support. Here is a question that would fit Stack Overflow very well, there is a well defined problem with all the details and we are able to provide an acceptable answer in a single exchange. That kind of interaction, on the other hand, is quite rare. It is a lot more common to have to have a lot more back and forth and we tend to try to give a complete solution, not just answer the initial question.Another issue is that Stack Overflow isn&#x2019;t moderated by us, which means that we would be subject to rules that we don&#x2019;t necessarily want to adhere to. For example, we get asked similar questions all the time, which are marked as duplicated and closed on Stack Overflow, but we want to actually answer people.&#xA0; GitHub issues are a good option for this kind of discussion, but they tend to cause people to raise issues, and one of the reasons that we have the google group is to create discussion. I guess it comes down to the different community that spring up from the communication medium.Speaking about documentation:RavenDB does have the official docs, which are easily navigable and searchable. Works well for beginners and provides good samples to start with, but there are gaps here and there, and it has far less coverage of the functionality than many popular free and open source projects.&#x2026;Ultimately, as a developer, I want to google my question and it&#x2019;s acceptable to have the answer on a non-official website. But if you&#x2019;re having a deep dive with RavenDB, it&#x2019;s unlikely to find it in the official docs, nor StackOverflow, nor GitHub.Documentation has always been a chore for me. The problem is that I know what the software does, so it can be hard to even figure out what we need to explain. This year we have hired a couple more technical writers specifically to address the missing pieces in our documentation. I think we are doing quite well at this point.What wasn&#x2019;t available at the time of this post and is available now is the book. All of the details about RavenDB that you could care too and more are detailed there are are available. It is also available to Google, so in many cases your Google search will point you to the right section in the book that may answer your question.I hope that these actions covered the gaps that Alex noted in our documentation. And there is also this blog, of course .Speaking about issues that he had run into:It&#x2019;s reliable and does work well. Unless it doesn&#x2019;t. And then a fix gets promptly released (a nightly build could be available within 24 hours after reporting the issue). And it works well again.&#x2026;All these bugs (and others I found) have been promptly fixed.&#x2026; stability of the server and the database integrity are sacred. Even a slight risk of losing it can keep you awake at night. So no, it&#x2019;s a biggy, unless the RavenDB team convinces me otherwise.I didn&#x2019;t include the list of issues that Alex pointed to on purpose. The actual issues don&#x2019;t matter that much, because he is correct, from Alex&#x2019;s perspective, RavenDB aught to Just Work, and anything else is our problem.We spend a lot of time on ensuring a high quality for RavenDB. I had a two parts with Jeffery Palermo about just that, and you might be interested in this keynote that goes into some of the challenges that are involved in making RavenDB.One of the issues that he raised was RavenDB crashing (or causing Windows to crash) because of a bug in the Windows Kernel that was deployed in a hotfix. The hotfix was quietly patched some time later by Microsoft, but in the meantime, RavenDB would crash.&#xA0; And a user would blame us, because we crashed. Another issue (RavenDB upgrade failing) was an intentional choice by us in the upgrade, however. We had a bug that can cause data corruption in some cases, we fixed it, but we had to deal with potentially problematic state of existing databases. We chose to be conservative and ask the user to take an explicit action in this case, to prevent data loss. It isn&#x2019;t ideal, I&#x2019;m afraid, but I believe that we have done the best that we could after fixing the underlying issue. In doubt, we pretty much always have to fall on the prevent data loss vs. availability side.Speaking about Linq &amp; JS support:let me give you a sense of how often you&#x2019;ll see LINQ queries throwing NotSupportedException in runtime.&#x2026;But in front of us a special case &#x2014; a database written in the .NET! There is no need in converting a query to SQL or JavaScript.I believe that I mentioned already that the initial Linq support for RavenDB literally took more time than building RavenDB itself, right? Linq is an awesome feature, for the consumer. For the provider, it is a mess. I&#x2019;m going to quote Frans Bouma on this:Something every developer of an ORM with a LINQ provider has found out: with a LINQ provider you&#x27;re never done. There are always issues popping up due to e.g. unexpected expressions in the tree.Now, as Alex points out. RavenDB is written in .NET, so we could technically use something like Serialize.Linq and support any arbitrary expression easily, right?Not really, I&#x2019;m afraid, and for quite a few reasons:Security &#x2013; you are effectively allowing a user to send arbitrary code to be executed on the server. That is never going to end up well. Compatibility &#x2013; we want to make sure that we are able to change our internals freely. If we are forced to accept (and then execute) code from the client, that freedom is limited.Performance &#x2013; issuing a query in this manners means that we&#x2019;ll have to evaluate the query on each document in the relevant collection. A full table scan. That is not a feature that RavenDB even has, and for a very good reason.Limited to .NET only &#x2013; we currently have client for .NET, JVM, Go, Python, C&#x2B;&#x2B; and Node.JS. Having features just for one client is not something that we want, it really complicates our lives. We think about queries using RQL, which are abstract in nature and don&#x2019;t tie us down with regards to how we implement them. That means that we can use features such as automatic indexes, build fast queries, etc. Speaking about RQL:Alex points out some issues with RQL as well. The first issue relates to the difference between a field existing and having a null value. RavenDB make a distinction between these state. A field can have a null value or it can have a missing value. In a similar way to the behavior of NULL in SQL, which can often create similar confusion. The problem with RavenDB is that the schema itself isn&#x2019;t required, so different documents can have different fields, so in our case, there is an additional level. A field can have a value, be null or not exist. And we reflect that in our queries. Unfortunately, while the behavior is well defined and documented, just like NULL behavior in SQL, it can be surprising to users.&#xA0; Another issue that Alex brings up is that negation queries aren&#x2019;t supported directly. This is because of the way we process queries and one of the ways we ensure that users are aware of the impact of the query. With negation query, we have to first match all documents the exclude all those that match the negation. For large number of documents, that can be expensive. Ideally, the user have a way to limit the scope of the matches that are being negated, which can really help performance.Speaking about safe by default:RavenDB is a lot less opinionated than it used to be. Alex rightfully points that out. As we got more users, we had to expand what you could do with RavenDB.&#xA0; It still pains me to see people do things that are going to be problematic in the end (extremely large page sizes are one good example), but our users demanded that. To quote Alex:I&#x2019;d preferred a slowed performance in production and a warning in the server logs rather than a runtime exception.Our issue with this approach is that no one looks at the logs and that this usually come to a head at 2 AM, resulting in a support call from the ops team about a piece of software that broke. Because of this, we have removed many such features, while turning them to alerts, and the very few that remained (mostly just the number of requests per session) can be controlled globally by the admin directly from the Studio. This ensures that the ops team can do something if you hit the wall, and of course, you can also configure this from the client side globally easily enough.As a craftsman, it pains me to remove those limits, but I have to admit that it significantly reduced the number of support calls that we had to deal with. Conclusion:Overall, I can say RavenDB is a very good NoSQL database for .NET developers, but the &#x201D;good&#x201D; is coming with a bunch of caveats. I&#x2019;m confident in my ability to develop any enterprise application with RavenDB applying the Domain-driven design (DDD) philosophy and practices.I think that this is really the best one could hope for. I think that Alex&#x2019;s review that is honest and to the point. Moreover, it is focused and detailed. That make very valuable. Because he got to his conclusions not out of brief tour of RavenDB but actually holding it up in the trenches.Thanks, Alex.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We released RavenDB Cloud a few months ago, with great response from the community. Since the cloud offer was released, we have been silently working on more features and capabilities.Many of them you&#x2019;ll never even notice. We have integrated RavenDB monitoring and RavenDB Cloud&#x2019;s capability to do live deploys, for example, so your RavenDB Cloud can do things like dynamically grow its disk size at need or the RavenDB instance can alert that it is running out of IOPS and upgrade its IOPS reservation, etc.Some of the new features, on the other hand, are quite visible. To increase the security of our users, you can now enable two factor authentication for your account. Just go to your Profile inside of the RavenDB Cloud Portal and you&#x2019;ll see the option:At this point, I don&#x2019;t think that I need to really say anything more about why 2FA is such an important feature and I encourage all our users to enable it in their accounts.Speaking of accounts, a hotly requested feature was the ability to have multiple users per account. We have implemented this and you can now invite users to your account.The common scenario for this is when you need to have the ops team as a whole have access to the organization&#x2019;s RavenDB Cloud. This saves the need to have a shared user and give a much better experience for larger organizations.We are actively working on our cloud offering, but with a few months to look back, I&#x2019;m really happy about where we are. If you have any suggestions or requests, I would love to hear them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I care about usability and the user experience for our users. We spend a lot of time on making sure that things are running smoothly. When we created RavenDB Cloud, I knew that it was important to create a good experience for our cloud offering. One of the most important things that I did was to go and look at other people&#x2019;s offerings and see where they failed to meet customer expectations. I recently run into this article about AWS Elastic. Similar issues has been raised about it for a while. And it was one of my explicit design goals of what not to do in our cloud offerings.Summarizing the discussion, it seems like the following major issues across the board.Backups &#x2013; Being able to have your own backup schedule and destinations. Retention policies based on your needs, etc. AWS Elastic uses hourly backups and you only get 14 days of that. Cosmos DB, to look at an Azure offering, is taking a backup every 4 hours and you have a maximum of two of them. We have users that needs to be able to go back weeks / months / years and look at the state of their database at a given point in time. The 8 hours backup period for Cosmos DB is really short, but even 14 days on AWS Elastic is short enough that you probably need to roll some other solutions for that.With RavenDB Cloud, you have automatic backups (hourly) with a retention period that defaults to 14 days. The key here, by the way, is defaults. You are absolutely free to define your own backup policies (per database or per cluster), that means that you can set your own destinations (want to do cross cloud backups, no problem) and your own retention policies. Visibility &#x2013; This is a very common complaint, it showed up in pretty much all resources that I checked and have been a common cause of complaints among the peers I sampled when we did the background for RavenDB Cloud. In particular, no logs or access to the debug endpoints is a killer for productivity. If you can&#x2019;t tell what the problem is, you can&#x2019;t fix it, so you&#x2019;ll need to call support and have someone look things over. Here are a few choice quotes, that I think goes to the heart of things.Here is Liz Bennett talking about things in 2017:I feel equipped to deal with most Elasticsearch problems, given access to administrative Elasticsearch APIs, metrics and logging. AWS&#x2019;s Elasticsearch offers access to none of that. Not even APIs that are read-only, such as the /_cluster/pending_tasks API. &#x2026;Without access to logs, without access to admin APIs, without node-level metrics (all you get is cluster-level aggregate metrics) or even the goddamn query logs, it&#x2019;s basically impossible to troubleshoot your own Elasticsearch cluster.&#x2026;AWS&#x2019;s Elasticsearch doesn&#x2019;t provide access to any of those things, leaving you no other option but to contact AWS&#x2019;s support team. But AWS&#x2019;s support team doesn&#x2019;t have the time, skills or context to diagnose non-trivial issuesAnd here is Nick Price, just a few days ago:So your cluster resize job broke (on a service you probably chose so you wouldn&#x2019;t have to deal with this stuff in the first place), so you open a top severity ticket with AWS support. Invariably, they&#x2019;ll complain about your shard count or sizing and will helpfully add a link to the same shard sizing guidelines you&#x2019;ve read 500 times by now. And then you wait for them to fix it. And wait. And wait. The last time I tried to resize a cluster and it locked up, causing a major production outage, it took SEVEN DAYS for them to get everything back online.&#x2026;They couldn&#x2019;t even tell if they&#x2019;d fixed the problem and had to have me verify whether they had restored connectivity between their own systems.I think that the reason this is the case is that AWS Elastic is a multi tenant service. so each instance is shared among multiple clients. That means that they have to limit the endpoints that you can access, to not leak data from other clients.With RavenDB Cloud, you get all the usual diagnostic features features that you would usually get. We don&#x2019;t want you to escalate things to support. The ideal scenario is that if you run into any trouble, you&#x2019;ll be able to figure things out completely on your own. Hell, we do active monitoring and will contact our customers if we see outliers in the system behavior to gives them a heads up. You can go to your RavenDB Cloud instance, pull the logs, watch ongoing traffic and even get a stack trace of the running production system. Everything is there, in the box.Flexibility &#x2013; The most common cited issue with AWS Elastic seems to be related to the issue of not being able to make changes in the environment. Or, rather, you can do that (increasing node count or changing the instance types) but when you do that, you are going to have a full blown migration step. That means that you&#x2019;ll double the number of nodes you&#x2019;ll run and incur a really expensive operation to copy all the data. Given that Elastic already has this feature (add a node to an existing cluster) the decision not to support it is likely related to constraints on the AWS Elastic multi tenancy layer.I&#x2019;m not really sure what to say here, RavenDB Cloud has no such issue. To be rather more exact, our multi tenant architecture was specifically designed so the outward facing differences between how you&#x2019;ll operate RavenDB on your own systems vs. how you&#x2019;ll operate RavenDB on the Cloud will be minimal.Adding and removing node is certainly possible. And in fact, in my intro video to RavenDB Cloud I showed how I can upgrade a cluster along multiple axes, while it is being actively written to. All with exactly zero interruptions in service. Client code that was busy reading and writing from the cluster didn&#x2019;t even noticed that. That was certainly not an easy feature to implement, but I considered this to be the baseline of what we had to offer.Support &#x2013; Both Nick and Liz had a poor experience with AWS Elastic support. You can read the quotes above, or read the full posts for the whole picture.I don&#x2019;t like support. We explicitly modeled the company so support is a cost center, not a source of revenue. That means that we want to close each support incident as soon as possible.&#xA0; What this doesn&#x2019;t mean is that we do an auto close of all issues on creation. That would give us fantastic closure rates, I imagine, but at a cost.Instead, we have a multi layered system to deal with things. Consider the scenario Nick run into, a full disk. That is certainly something that you might run into, no?Automatic recovery - With RavenDB,&#xA0; a single full disk will simply cause that node to reject writes, nothing else. And the cluster as a whole will continue to operate normally. With RavenDB Cloud, we have a lot more control, and our monitoring systems will automatically alert on disk full and increase its size automatically behind the scenes with no impact on users. Diagnostics - Active monitoring means that you&#x2019;ll be notified in the RavenDB Studio about suspicious issues (for example, you run out of IOPS) and be able to investigate them with full visibility. RavenDB does a lot of work to ensure that if something is broken, you&#x2019;ll know about it. Front line support &#x2013; if you need to call our support, the person answering the call is going to be able to help you. They would typically be an engineer that was involved either in the actual building / managing of RavenDB Cloud or (2nd tier) involved in the development of RavenDB itself.My goal with a support call is to get you back to speed as soon as possible, and the usual metrics for that are measured in minutes, not days. We are now several months post the launch of RavenDB Cloud and the pickup of customers has been great. What is more important from my end, however, is that we are seeing how this kind of investment in our architecture and setup is paying off.</p>
