            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A decade(!) ago&#xA0; I wrote that you should avoid soft deletes. Today I run into a question in the mailing list and I remembered writing about this, it turned out that there has been quite the discussion on this at the time.&#xA;&#xA;My post on avoiding soft deletes&#xA;Richard&#x2019;s post on the trouble data deletion cause&#xA;Udi&#x2019;s post about never deleting data&#xA;Dare&#x2019;s post summarizing most of the discussion&#xA;&#xA;The context of the discussion at the time was deleting data from relational systems, but the same principles apply. The question I just fielded asked how you can translate a Delete() operation inside the RavenDB client to a soft delete (IsDeleted = true) operation. The RavenDB client API supports a few ways to interact with how we are talking to the underlying database, including some pretty interesting hooks deep into the pipeline.&#xA;What it doesn&#x2019;t offer, though, is a way to turn a Delete() operation into and update (or an update to a delete). We do have facilities in place that allow you to detect (and abort) on invalid operations. For example, invoices should never be deleted. You can tell the RavenDB client API that it should throw whenever an invoice is about to be deleted, but you have no way of saying that we should take the Delete(invoice) and turn that into a soft delete operation.&#xA;This is quite intentionally by design.&#xA;Having a way to transform basic operations (like delete &#x2013;&gt; update) is a good way to be pretty confused about what is actually going on in the system. It is better to allow the user to enforce the required behavior (invoices cannot be deleted) and let the calling code handle this different.&#xA;The natural response here, of course, is that this places a burden on the calling code. Surely we want to be able to follow DRY and not write conditionals when the user clicks on the delete button. But this isn&#x2019;t an issue where this is extra duplicated code.&#xA;&#xA;An invoice is never deleted, it is cancelled. There are tax implications on that, you need to get it correct.&#xA;A payment is never removed, it is refunded.&#xA;&#xA;You absolutely want to block deletions of those type of documents, and you need to treat them (very) different in code.&#xA;In the enusing decade since the blog posts at the top of this post were written, there have been a number of changes. Some of them are architecturally minor, such as the database technology of choice or the guiding principles for maintainable software development. Some of them are pretty significant.&#xA;One such change is the GDPR.&#xA;&#x201C;Huh?!&#x201D; I can imagine you thinking. How does the GDPR applies to an architectural discussion of soft deletes vs. business operations. It turns out that it is very relevant. One of the things that the GDPR mandates (and there are similar laws elsewhere, such as the CCPA) the right to be forgotten. So if you are using soft deletes, you might actually run into real problems down the line. &#x201C;I asked to be deleted, they told me they did, but they secretly kept my data!&#x201D;.&#xA0; The one thing that I keep hearing about the GDPR is that no one ever found it humorous. Not with the kind of penalties that are attached to it.&#xA;So when thinking about deletes in your system, you need to consider quite a few factors:&#xA;&#xA;Does it make sense, from a business perspective, to actually lose that data? Deleting a note from a customer&#x2019;s record is probably just fine. Removing the record of the customer at all? Probably not.&#xA;Do I need to keep this data? Invoices are one thing that pops to mind.&#xA;Do I need to forget this data? That is the other way, and what you can forget and how can be really complex.&#xA;&#xA;At any rate, for all but the simplest scenarios, just marking IsDeleted = true is likely not going to be sufficient. And all the other arguments that has been raised (which I&#x2019;m not going to repeat, read the posts, they are good ones) are still in effect.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Production ready code is a term that I don&#x2019;t really like. I much prefer the term: Production Ready System. This is because production readiness isn&#x2019;t really a property of a particular piece of code, but of the entire system.The term is often thrown around, and usually it is referred to adding error handling and robustness to a piece of code.

Asked to review it, most people would point out the lack of error handling if the request fails. I asked on twitter about this and got some good answers, see here.In practice, to make this piece of code production worthy you&#x2019;ll need a lot more code and infrastructure:.NET specific - ConfigureAwait(false) to ensure this works properly with a SynchronizationContext.NET specific &#x2013; Http Client caches Proxy settings and DNS resolution, requiring you to replace it if there is a failure / on a timer..NET specific &#x2013; Exceptions won&#x2019;t be thrown from Http Client if the server sent an error back (including things like auth failures).Input validation &#x2013; especially if this is exposed to potentially malicious user input. A retry mechanism (with back off strategy) is required to handle transient conditions, but need either idempotent requests or way to avoid duplicate actions.Monitoring for errors, health checks, latencies, etc.Metrics for performance, how long such operations take, how many ops / sec, how many failures, etc.Metrics for the size of responses (which may surprise you).Correlation id for end to end tracing.Properly handling of errors &#x2013; including reading the actual response from the server and surfacing it to the caller / logs. Handling successful requests that don&#x2019;t contain the data they are supposed to.And these are just the stuff that pop to my head from looking at 10 lines of really simple code. And after you have done all of that, you are still not really production ready. Mostly because if you implemented all of that in the GetProductAsync() function, you can&#x2019;t really figure out what is actually going on.These kind of operation is something that you want to have to implement once, via the infrastructure. There are quite a few libraries which does robust service handling that you can use, and using that will help, but it will only take you part way toward production ready system.Let&#x2019;s take cars and driving as an example of a system. If you&#x2019;ll look at a car, you&#x2019;ll find that quite a bit of the car design, constraints and feature set is driven directly by the need to handle the failure mode. A modern car will have (just the stuff that is obvious and pops to mind):Drivers &#x2013; required explicit learning stage and passing competency test, limits on driving in impaired state, higher certification levels for more complex vehicles.Accident prevention: ABS, driver assist and seat belt beeps.Reduce injuries / death when accidents do happen &#x2013; seat belts, air bags, crumple zones.On the road &#x2013; rumble strips, road fence, road maintenance, traffic laws, active and passive enforcement.I&#x2019;m pretty sure that anyone who actually understand cars will be shocked by how sparse my list is. It is clear, however, that accidents, their prevention and reducing their lethality and cost are a part and parcel of all design decisions on cars. In fact, there is a multi layered approach for increasing the safety of drivers and passengers. I&#x2019;m not sure how comparable the safety of a car is to production readiness of a piece of software, though. One of the ways that cars compete with one another is on the safety features. So there is a strong incentive to improve there. That isn&#x2019;t usually the case with software.It usually take a few (costly) lessons about how much being unavailable costs you before you can really feel how much not being production ready costs you. And at this point, most people turn to error handling and recovery strategies. I think this is a mistake. A great read on the topic is How Complex System Fail, it is a great, short paper, highly readable and very relevant to the field of software development. I consider a system to production ready when it has, not error handling inside a particular component, but actual dedicated components related to failure handling (note the difference from error handling), management of failures and its mitigations. The end goal is that you&#x2019;ll be able to continue execution and maintain semblance of normalcy to the outside world. That means having dedicated parts of the system that are just about handling (potentially very rare) failure modes as well as significant impact on your design. and architecture. That is not an inexpensive proposition. it takes quite a lot of time and effort to get there, and it is usually only worth it if you actually need the reliability this provides.With cars, the issue is literally human lives, so we are willing to spend quite a lot of preventing accidents and reducing their impact. However, the level of robustness I expect from a toaster is quite different (don&#x2019;t go on fire, pretty much) and most of that is already handled by the electrical system in the house. Erlang is a good example of a language and environment that has always prioritized production availability. Erlang systems famously have 99.9999999% availability (that is nine nines). That is 32 milliseconds of downtime per year, which pretty much means less than the average GC pause in most systems. Erlang have a lot of infrastructure to support this kind of availability numbers, but that still require you to understand the whole system.For example, if your Erlang service depends on a database, a restart of a database server (which takes 2 minutes to cycle) might very well means that your service processes will die, will be restarted by their supervisors only to die again and again. At this point, the supervisors itself give up and die, passing the buck up the chain. The usual response is to restart the supervisor again a few times, but the database is still down and we are in a cascading failure scenario. Just restarting is really effective in handling errors, but for certain failure scenarios, you need to consider how you&#x2019;ll actually make it work. A database being unavailable can make your entire system cycle through its restarts options and die just as the database is back online. For that matter, what happens to all the requests that you tried to process at that time?I have had a few conversations that went something like: &#x201C;Oh, we use Erlang, that is handled&#x201D;, but production readiness isn&#x2019;t something that you can solve at the infrastructure level. It has a global impact on your architecture, design and the business itself. There are a lot of questions that you can&#x2019;t answer from a technical point of view. &#x201C;If I can&#x2019;t validate the inventory status, should I accept an order or not?&#x201D; is probably the most famous one, and that is something that the business itself need to answer. Although, to be honest, the most important answer that you need from the business is a much more basic one: &#x201C;Do we need to worry about production readiness, and if so, by how much?&#x201D;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The first part is here. As a reminder, Sled is an embedded database engine written in Rust. It takes a very different approach for how to store data, which I&#x2019;m really excited to see. And with that, let&#x2019;s be about it. In stopped in my last post when getting to the flusher, which simply sleep and call flush on the iobufs.The next file is iobuf.rs.Note that there are actually two separate things here, we have the IoBuf struct:And we have IoBufs struct, which contains the single buffer.Personally, I would use a different name, because is is going to be very easy to confuse them. At any rate, this looks like this is an important piece, so let&#x2019;s see what is going on in there.You can see that the last three fields shown compose of what looks like a ring buffer implementation. Next, we have this guys:Both of them looks interesting / scary. I can&#x2019;t tell yet what they are doing, but the &#x201C;interesting thread interleaving&#x201D; stuff is indication that this is likely to be complex.The fun starts at the start() function:This looks like it is used in the recovery process, so whenever you are restarting the instance.&#xA0; The code inside is dense, take a look at this:This test to see if the snapshot provided is big enough to be considered stand alone (I think). You can see that we set the next_lsn (logical sequence number) and next_lid (last id? logical id?, not sure here). So far, so good. But all of that is a single expression, and it goes for 25 lines.The end of the else clause also return a value, which is computed from the result of reading the file. It works, it is elegant but it takes a bit of time to decompose.There is something called SegmentAccountant that I&#x2019;m ignoring for now because we finally got to the good parts, where actual file I/O is being performed. Focusing on the new system startup, which is often much simpler, we have:You can see that we make some writes (not sure what is being written yet) and then sync it. the maybe_fail! stuff is manual injection of faults, which is really nice to see. The else portion is also interesting.This is when we can still write to the existing snapshot, I guess. And this limits the current buffer to the limits of the buffer size. From context, lid looks like the global value across files, but I&#x2019;m not sure yet.I run into this function next:On its own, it isn&#x2019;t really that interesting. I guess that I don&#x2019;t like the unwrap call, but I get why it is there. It would significantly complicate the code if you had to handle failures from both the passed function and with_sa unable to take the lock (and that should only be the case if a thread panicked while holding the mutex, which presumably kill the whole process).Sled calls itself alpha software, but given the number of scaffolding that I have seen so far (event log, debug_delay and not the measurements for lock durations) it has a lot of work done around actually making sure that you have the required facilities to support it. Looking at the code history, it is a two years old project, so there has been time for it to grow.Next we have this method:What this method actually going on in here is that based on the size of the in_buf, it will write it to a separate blob (using the lsn as the file name). If the value is stored externally, then it creates a message header that points to that location. Otherwise, it creates a header that encodes the length of the in_buf and returns adds that to the out_buf. I don&#x2019;t like the fact that this method get passed the two bool variables. The threshold decision should probably be done inside the method and not outside. The term encapsulate is also not the best choice here. write_msg_to_output would probably more accurate.The next interesting bit is write_to_log(), which goes on for about 200 lines. This takes the specified buffer, pad it if needed and write it to the file. It looks like it all goes to the same file, so I wonder how it deals with space recovery, but I&#x2019;ll find it later. I&#x2019;m also wondering why this is called a log, because it doesn&#x2019;t look like a WAL system to me at this point. It does call fsync on the file after the write, though. There is also some segment behavior here, but I&#x2019;m used to seeing that on different files, not all in the same one.It seems that this method can be called concurrently on different buffers. There is some explicit handling for that, but I have to wonder about the overall efficiency of doing that. Random I/O and especially the issuance of parallel fsyncs, are likely not going to lead to the best system perf.Is where the concurrent and possibly out of order write notifications are going. This remembers all the previous notifications and if there is a gap, will wait until the gap has been filled before it will notify interested parties that the data has been persisted to disk. Because I&#x2019;m reading the code in a lexical order, rather than in a more reasonable layered or functional approach, this gives me a pretty skewed understanding of the code until I actually finish it all. I actually do that on purpose, because it forces me to consider a lot more possibilities along the way. There are a lot of questions that might be answered by looking at how the code is actually being used in parts that I haven&#x2019;t read yet. At any rate, one thing to note here is that I think that there is a distinct possibility that a crash after segment N &#x2B;1 was written (and synced) but before segment N was done writing might undo the successful write for N&#x2B;1. I&#x2019;m not sure yet how this is used, so that is just something to keep in mind for now.I managed to find this guy:If you&#x2019;ll recall, this is called on a timer to write the current in memory state. The only other interesting thing in this file is:This looks like it is racing with other calls on trying to write the current buffer. I&#x2019;m not so sure what sealed means. I think that this is to prevent other threads from writing to the same buffer while you might be trying to write it out.That is enough for now, it has gotten late again, so I&#x2019;ll continue this in another post.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The Sled project is an embedded database written in Rust. I run into it a few times recently and given my day job, I decided to take a peek and understand how it works. The project talks about being Log Structure Merge (and also exposing this to the client) with B&#x2B;Tree read performance. The last time I read an LSM codebase was quite some time ago, so this is going to be quite interesting, I hope.As usual, I&#x2019;m doing a stream of consciousness as I&#x2019;m going through the code. I&#x2019;m looking at commit 6ce3e1264d3bb46de768e8fe338bade02d0b30dc.The first thing that I found is the actual source code for this:The fact that there is a page cache component already tell me quite a lot about the project. That is uses pages (LevelDB does not, for example) and that it is cached (so likely not using mmap). That will likely be important later, but when starting out I enjoy jumping to conclusions and then seeing if I was right or not.The following is taken from the readme for the pagecache:This is quite interesting. Mostly because this shows a very different approach to building a page cache. It isn&#x2019;t your usual B-Tree page, it seems. The docs reference LLAMA a lot, but I would rather go through the code first and read scholarly articles later.As usual, I&#x2019;m going over the code in lexical order, which means that the first real code file that I run into is a Rust implementation of doubly linked list. Nothing really interesting there, except massive amounts of unsafe code, so I&#x2019;m going to skip to it&#x2019;s usage, which is to implement a least recently used cache.There are N shards, determined by the configuration of the system. This is controlled by cache_bits, where 2^CacheBits is the actual size. I&#x2019;m not sure why the code uses this methods instead of just a number.The codebase contains the values 0, 2 and 6 for cache_bits, giving us 1 shard, 4 shards and 64 shards, respectively. I assume that they use this to reduce contention on the same Shard instance for concurrent operations. The LRU&#x2019;s main method is accessed, which simply forward the call to one of the shards, so I&#x2019;m going to skip that and see how that actually works when I&#x2019;ll look at the shard code. Here is what the Shard looks like:&#xA0;Note that capacity is actually the max capacity, not reserved space in the entries vector. Each entry contains the actual size that it is using, as well and the Node itself (that reside in the LRU). The actual value that is kept is a PageId, which is the native integer type for the platform (32 bits &#x2013; 4 bytes / 64 bits &#x2013; 8 bytes). I&#x2019;m not sure yet if this is a persisted value, but for something that is meant to be used in a persisted store, I find that choice very strange. It means that on 32 bits machine, you can only use 4 billion pages, while 64 bits there is much higher limit. That means that a database created on 64 bits might not be valid for 32 bits. When building Voron, we were very careful that data will be the same in 32 bits and 64 bits, Windows / MacOS / Linux, etc. When you call accessed on the Shard, it will add it to the list, and if the size of all entries is higher than the capacity, will remove entries until the size in the cache is smaller than the maximum capacity. Interestingly enough, Sled is using an Epoch based GC system in Rust, implemented by Crossbeam. I wrote about Epoch systems when I reviewed FASTER, and I understand that Epoch GC is pretty common in Rust concurrent programming, because otherwise you run the risk of memory corruption. The ds (I assume data structure) folder of the page cache also provide a concurrent Stack implementation, which it pretty elegant to read, but you need to be well versed in the Epoch handling to understand how it all works correctly under the covers.The interesting stuff in the ds folder is the pagetable, which start with the following structs:Each of those is initialized to array of pointers that is 2 MB in size (262,144 pointers, basically). That is a pretty big structure, and the PageTable struct ties it all together:The top of the file mention that this assume that the caller is going to have a dense key space, and this make sense. Theoretically, this will use a maximum of 512GB if you store a sparse set of data in the page table.All the operations in the page table are some variant of the traverse operation, so let&#x2019;s focus on that.First, the key is split to the first 18 bits (0 .. 256K) and the rest of the value. The first part is used to find the level 1 value. The debug_delay() calls are debug only calls that add random waits, which help catch race conditions. Given that the code uses explicit Atomic instructions, I&#x2019;m not surprised to see that there is really no help from the Rust safety behavior to ensure that there aren&#x2019;t any logical race conditions. This is the first time I&#x2019;m reading real Rust code that explicitly deal with concurrency (without using the hammer that is Mutex, at least), and it is&#x2026; reassuring seeing the same kind of behaviors that I&#x2019;m injecting into my code to validate things.This next bit handles adding a new value (safely) at the next level. Given the dense assumption, we can safely assume that this is a rare operationLook at the comment when we fail to win the compare_and_set call. Who is actually going to drop the unused created value? That is on the Guard and Epoch, I think. We associated the value with them when we called into_shared, and since we didn&#x2019;t take it out from the guard, it will be removed when the Epoch is over.The final act of traverse() is to just return the value from the second level, like so:Note that this may be an empty value, so let&#x2019;s see how this actually get used. I&#x2019;m using the simplest caller, which is get().You can see that we have to do explicit null checking, translating that to an Option call to make calling code idiomatic.&#xA0; The rest of the code there is just memory management, so I&#x2019;m going to skip that and look at the rest of the pagecache code, now that I understand the underlying data structures.Note, the code uses the Lsn as a logical type name, this maps to a 64 bits signed integer. The first file in the pagecache crate is the blob_io one, which handles reading blob. Here is the (crate public only) functions that are implemented there.Remember, LSN is the (Logical Sequence Number) and is a signed 64 bits integer. Config I&#x2019;m not sure about at this point. The read_blob and write_blob are fairly simple. They just read / write (with CRC32 checks) data from disk. This is done on a full file each time. So that is quite interesting. The Config is responsible for mapping between an LSN and a file path. The call to remove_blob will simply delete the mapped file from the disk, but it is the call to gc_blobs that is really interesting. What this does is to basically delete all the files whose name is greater than the stable_lsn provided. This is interesting, because it tells us a lot about the actual on disk persistent format. Based on just the blob_io.rs file, I can tell that Sled is writing fairly large files to disk and reading them to memory. It is probably going to call gc_blobs() as part of its recovery and I&#x2019;m willing to assume at this point that each blob is actually a segment. As I said, I like assuming things upfront when doing this kind of code reviews. I&#x2019;m going to continue my reading and see if I was right.The config file starts with usage instructions, which looks like:So that is really interesting. First, we can see that Sled is probably only calling fsync once in a while, depending on its configuration. I looked into a real world project, and it uses the default value, which is flush every 500 ms and snapshot after 1 million. The reason this is interesting is that my experience tells me is that whenever I see a configuration option like that, it means that fsync is going to be pretty expensive and the database engine has chosen to allow users to trade performance for safety. Voron, in contrast, actually don&#x2019;t have any such feature. We don&#x2019;t allow users to make that choice, instead, we accepted the fsync costs and dealt with them (using async commit and transaction merging, for example).Anyway, we were talking about the config and how it works, here is how the Config gives us the path for a blob:So this is pretty much just as expected. The data for each blob is a separate file under the blobs directory. Now we are only left with figuring out what that blob was.The next file of interest is the DiskPtr file, which contains this struct:And the only interesting method is the read():So now we have more interesting data. There is stuff that is kept inline (presumably small items) and larger stuff that are read from the blobs directory. We already saw what the read_blob behavior is, but we haven&#x2019;t checked what the meaning of read_message is. This is implemented later in the code, so I&#x2019;m going to ignore it and just look at its return value:So that allow us to make sense of what is going above. Basically, this is &#x201C;gimme some bytes&#x201D; call, regardless of where this is actually stored (which I don&#x2019;t know yet).The next file is event_log, and it is a debug tool to help verify the behavior of the system. I wholeheartedly approve and it is a really good sign for the maturity of the codebase.The next is flusher, which is a dedicate thread that call this continuously:There is nothing of interest in there, but it does indicate no coordination between flushing and other activities. Not sure whatever this is a good or bad idea.Now, let&#x2019;s see what this iobuf is all about, shall we?The first thing I run into in this file is this:And I can&#x2019;t really figure this one out. I mean, why? Just setting InnerLsn = i64 should be good enough for all platforms, I think. I guess there might be some optimizations stuff that I&#x2019;m missing, but that seems unlikely. In 64 bits, I would expect isize and i64 to have the exact same behavior.This is now getting pretty late, so I&#x2019;m going to close this for today. Tomorrow, I&#x2019;m going to try to figure out how the rest of it works.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I don&#x2019;t usually talk about what we call the Studio Features. These set of features impact the RavenDB Studio and are meant to make the lives of developers and administrators of RavenDB easier. We actually spend lot of effort on the Studio, because making features accessible and usable is considered to be a core part of the feature itself. We run the metrics, and bout 30% &#x2013; 35% of the time spent building RavenDB 4.0 was spent on the Studio. We are still investing &gt; 10% of our time and effort in continuously improving the Studio. I tend not to write about the Studio explicitly because we usually use it to show case the server features.This feature, on the other hand, is purely a Studio feature. Yesterday I talked about Revisions in RavenDB and was reminded that we also have a new major feature for Revisions in the Studio only. Now you can diff different revisions directly&#xA0; in the Studio.Here is how you invoke this feature:When you click on the compare button, you&#x2019;ll get the following screen:You can compare a revision to the current document or a revision to revision. This can make it very easy to see what changed between two versions of a document.</p>
