            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In this series so far, I explored several ways that we can implement integer compression. I focused on the FastPFor algorithm and dove deeply into how it works. In the last post, I showed how we can use the SIMD intrinsics to generate vectorized code that can process a lot of data very quickly.&#xA;With this baseline established, we need to understand the use case we have in RavenDB for integer compression. We are actually using this for the classic scenario, posting lists as part of the indexing engine. However, there are quite a few differences in how we want to actually utilize it.&#xA;Let&#x2019;s take Lucene as a good example, since that is one of the classic examples for a search engine. From the ground up, Lucene is meant to be used in batching scenarios. That has a lot of impact on the design. In particular, it means that a posting list for Lucene is something that you write once in a big batch of operations. For RavenDB, however, we explicitly reject his approach. We want to allow to do on-the-fly indexing and we cannot afford to pay the cost of merging many small writes to big files over time.&#xA;The FastPFor algorithm is meant to get a lot of data, encode that in a compressed form and then allow you to iterate over the results as fast as possible. But RavenDB&#x2019;s needs are different. At the most basic level, RavenDB thinks about things in 8KB pages. A posting list for RavenDB is composed of the following:&#xA;&#xA;Single &#x2013; just a single value (common when indexing unique values)&#xA;Small &#x2013; can fit in under 4KB&#xA;Large &#x2013; requires more than 4KB of data, in which case we split it on 8KB boundaries.&#xA;&#xA;What&#x2019;s the point here? The idea is that when we need to update a posting list (add or remove items), we have one of those three options:&#xA;&#xA;Single &#x2013; we just update the value, duh!&#xA;Small &#x2013; FastPFor is fast, right? It is cheap enough to unpack the compressed values, merge with the new items (or the removals) and compress again.&#xA;Large &#x2013; here we are talking about a lot of values, potentially tens of millions or higher. How do we handle updates in this case?&#xA;&#xA;The answer is that we are going to be making use of a B&#x2B; Tree, with some caveats. The basic idea is that we have two types of pages in the tree. A branch page is the classic B&#x2B; Tree concept, which points to leaf pages below it that contain some range of values. However, the leaf pages, on the other hand, are very different.&#xA;Each leaf page is just an 8KB buffer that holds the compressed data, nothing more. When we want to update the values in the posting list, we find the relevant page that needs to be updated, then we just unpack, merge &amp; compress the values. It&#x2019;s actually cheaper to go this route than any other alternative.&#xA;There is another important aspect. Lucene (and most other indexing systems) assume that your posting list is using 32 bits integers. That limits the number of items in an index to 2.1 billion (up to 4.2 billion, for some implementations). I don&#x2019;t like that limit, not at today&#x2019;s scale. So we internally use 64bits integers in our posting lists.&#xA;That&#x2026; however, is actually too big. In practice, we use 54 bits for the indexed entries. That gives us a maximum number of 18,014,398,509,481,984 items and at a range of 100,000 items per second, we are good for 5,712 years.&#xA0; Those 10 bits allow us to encode additional information about the actual entry that is being indexed, and reduce the number of external lookups we need to do. Taking 10 bits from the entry id means that we are going to hit the 32 bits limit at around 2 million entries, which is really low.&#xA;Then there is another problem, if I have a posting list I want to compress that has 100,000 items in it, I would need to compress that into multiple pages, but figuring out how to split the compressed stream in a way that makes it usable to work with is not trivial at all.&#xA;In short, we have two major concerns with using FastPFor in RavenDB, int64 and paged writes. There is another aspect that I didn&#x2019;t mention, however. FastPFor will take an array of numbers and compress them. If you want to also use delta compression, that is something that you need to add on top of that.&#xA;Now that we understand the constraints we have to operate around, let&#x2019;s talk about the kind of API that I would like to build:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;What is going on here?&#xA0; Well, the basic idea is that you&#x2019;ll create an encoder as part of the indexing process. For each posting list that you want to process, you&#x2019;ll call the Encode() method, passing it the data to be encoded.&#xA;The Encode() method will return the required size for encoding the entire list as a single operation. Note that it does not actually write the data out (indeed, it has nowhere to write it). The calling code is then able to make decisions based on the returned size. If they have a buffer big enough to hold the encoded data, they can pass it to the Write() method.&#xA;Things get more interesting when we don&#x2019;t have a suitable buffer. Remember that we have a limit of 4KB for small posting lists and 8KB per page for large posting lists. The idea with Write() is that it will write as much as it can to the output, allowing you to use multiple buffers to store the compressed posting list.&#xA;In terms of work being done, the Encode() phase copies the post list entries to its own buffer, preparing it to be written out. The process of actually writing the data to the output buffer is mostly concerned with ensuring that we don&#x2019;t exceed the size of the provided buffer.&#xA;This approach means that we only have to pay the encoding code once, which is quite nice. Moreover, the number of checks that we have to make to ensure that we can fit the data into the buffer is also greatly reduced.&#xA;What about decoding? That is handled using:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Here we have a very interesting observation, the Encoder is a class, but the Decoder is a struct. We assume that decoding is far more frequent, so we use a struct to avoid an unnecessary memory allocation.&#xA;In order to ensure high performance, the decoder makes assumptions about the provided buffers. We will always accept a buffer that has a minimum size, for example.&#xA;With all of this out of the way, I&#x2019;m going to dedicate the next post to discussing the actual implementation and semantics we have for FastPFor encoding.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the code of the simdcomp library there is a 25KLOC file that does evil things to SIMD registers to get bit packing to work. When I looked at the code the first few dozen times, I had a strong desire to run away screaming. Luckily, this isn&#x2019;t just some pile of complicated code, but well-thought-out set of functions that are meant to provide optimal code for specific tasks. In particular, the code is specialized for each bit width that you may want to bit pack (0 .. 32). Even better, no one actually sat down to write it out by hand, there is a Python script that would generate the code.&#xA;The first step was to understand what exactly is going on in the code, and then see how we can translate that to C#. Even just a few years ago, that would have been either an impossible dream or required the use of a native library (with the associated PInvoke overhead). However, .NET today has a very robust intrinsics support, and vectors / SIMD instructions are natively supported.&#xA;I actually had a tougher challenge, since I want this code to run on x64 and ARM64 instances. The original code is x64 only, of course. The nice thing about SIMD support for .NET is that most of that can be done in a cross platform manner, with the JIT deciding what instructions will actually be emitted. There is still a very strong correlation between the vectorized code and the instructions that are being emitted, which means that I get both great control of what is going on and the appropriate abstraction. I was actually able to implement the whole thing without dropping to architecture-specific code, which makes me very happy.&#xA;Before we get any deeper, let&#x2019;s take a simple challenge. We want to take an array of 32 integers and pack each one of them in 4 bits into an array of 16 bytes. Here is what the code will look like:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

For each one of those, we shift the values by the required offset and or all of them together. Note that this means that the first item&#x2019;s four bits go in the first nibble, but the second item&#x2019;s bits go in the fifth nibble, etc.&#xA;The idea is that we are operating on 4 items at a time, reducing the total number of operations we have to perform. It may be easier to understand if you see those changes visually:&#xA;&#xA;What is happening here, however, is that we are able to do this transformation in very compact code. That isn&#x2019;t just an issue of high-level code, let&#x2019;s take a look at the assembly instructions that this generates:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

This code contains zero branches, it does four reads from memory, mask the elements, shift them and or them together.&#xA;The relevant instructions are:&#xA;&#xA;vmovupd &#x2013; read 4 integers to the register&#xA;vpand &#x2013; binary and with a value (masking)&#xA;vpslld &#x2013; shift to the left&#xA;vpor &#x2013; binary or&#xA;vmovdqu &#x2013; write 16 bytes to memory&#xA;&#xA;There are no branches, nothing to complicate the code at all. This is about as tight as you can get, at the level of machine instructions.&#xA;Of particular interest here is the C# code. The entire thing is basically a couple of lines of code, and I could express the whole thing as a single expression in a readable manner.

In the next post I&#x2019;m going to be talking more about the constraints we have and what we are actually trying to solve with this approach.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As I mentioned, I spent quite a lot of time trying to understand the mechanism behind how the FastPFor algorithm works. A large part of that was the fact that I didn&#x2019;t initially distinguish the separate steps in the process. Finding the bits&#x27; widths, packing the bits, metadata and exception management are all integral to how this works, and I tried to grok it all in one shot. I kept getting lost in 14KLOC files with dense SIMD instructions.&#xA;When looking at the code, it is also important to keep in mind that this is not a library that you are meant to pick up &amp; use. This is a research project. As such, there was enough work done to show the results, but all the spit &amp; polish that are associated with making a library ready for general consumption weren&#x2019;t done.&#xA;A simple example of that is that the code just assumes that the output buffer provided will be large enough (with no way to estimate upfront) and will overflow the buffer if that happens. Perfectly acceptable for research code, hell no for production usage, naturally.&#xA;In the same manner, the repository contains a lot of code. Most of that is being used as part of comparing the FastPFor algorithm to various other options. That can make it hard to understand what are the core parts of the algorithm and what is effectively chuff.&#xA;To be honest, the hardest part for me, however, was figuring out the memory allocation patterns that are going on in here. There is a high usage of C&#x2B;&#x2B; containers, with implicit allocations and hidden memory management. Here is a piece of code that I had to struggle to understand for quite some time, for example:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

A lot of the code in the project assumes that you are passed a buffer of a certain size and operate on that directly. That produces great results in terms of efficiency and code density. But when I read this code it was &#x201C;obvious&#x201D; to me that there is an out-of-band work here. If the provided buffer isn&#x2019;t perfectly aligned on 32 boundary, that method will write read or write beyond the end of the buffer.&#xA;Look at line 9 there, where the source container is being resized to ensure that this is fine, since we increase the container size to be exactly 32 elements aligned. We revert this operation later in line 20.&#xA;For some SIMD instructions, it matters the alignment of the buffers we are working on. This is handled using a custom allocator on the containers, which is not usually something that I would pay attention to.&#xA;In short, from my perspective, there is a lot of hidden behavior in non-trivial C&#x2B;&#x2B; code usage there that masks the actual behavior of the algorithm in question.&#xA;If you are looking at FastPFor (and if you care enough to look at this series of posts, you probably should), take into consideration that this code shouldn&#x2019;t be applied as is, but should probably be adapted for your needs.&#xA;In the next post, I&#x2019;m going to start discussing how we did just that for RavenDB.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The FastPFor is an integer compression algorithm that was published in 2012 initially. You can read the paper about it here: Decoding billions of integers per second through vectorization.&#xA;I&#x2019;ve run into this algorithm many times in the past. You pretty much can&#x2019;t be in the database arena and not run into that. It is an interesting paper, and it has a GitHub repository with the code, which is great. Except that I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what was going on there.&#xA;I actually tried stepping through the code a bunch of times, and I always ended up getting lost.

I tried looking at the code, and I basically noped out. Too complex for me to understand, it seems.&#xA;But I kept running into this, and we recently had a strong need for something similar. So I basically took the time to meditate on this for a while.&#xA;On a personal level, I realized that I was trying to understand how the whole thing worked by just stepping through the code and reading the paper. The problem was that I was mixing several different layers and wasn&#x2019;t able to create the proper separation between them.&#xA;FastPFor builds upon the previously discussed simdcomp, once you understand that, you can go through this in isolation. For this reason, I first talked about SIMD bit-packing and showed an example usage, before actually diving into how FastPFor itself works.&#xA;As a reminder, simdcomp provides routines for quick packing and unpacking of integers, nothing more. FastPFor is where the actual compression happens. Let&#x2019;s see what is actually going on here. Consider the following list, which we previously discussed:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1871143144&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7984&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;If we&#x2019;ll try bit-pack this list, we&#x2019;ll find out that we aren&#x2019;t gaining much. The first value is 31 bits in length, after all, and that means that we aren&#x2019;t able to save much. We talked about Frame of Reference (FOR) as a way to handle that. We can treat every128 block of numbers as a block that has its own reference point and compute the maximum number of bits for that location. That would actually save us a lot of space, but it isn&#x2019;t ideal. In the case above, most entries in the list can be packed in just 3 bits, except 2. That is where PFor comes into play, which stands for Patched Frame of Reference.&#xA;The key aspects of FastPFor are how it figures out what is the best size to use to pack the numbers, the way it detects what should be patched, and the manner in which it stores this.&#xA;The code boils down to a single function:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

This function accepts an array of integers (whose size is 128) and computes the best number of bits to use to pack it.&#xA;How does that work? The first thing this does is compute how many numbers we have for each bit range. This is done using the asmbits() call, which is basically a LeadingZeroCount(). The end result is a frequency map that we can use to estimate how many bits will be required to store the items from this block.&#xA;We start from the maximum number of bits that we need to store all the numbers in the block, and we go down, checking what would be the best cost (in terms of space). Since we need to store exceptions somewhere, we compute the cost of that as we go down in the list.&#xA;This function gives us:&#xA;&#xA;bestb &#x2013; the number of bits needed to pack all the items in the block that would result in the&#xA0;smallest output size&#xA;bestcexception &#x2013; the count of exceptions (numbers that do not fit into bestb bits&#xA;maxb &#x2013; the maximum number of bits that we need to store for this block&#xA;&#xA;That is the key function, the one that is responsible for getting the best compression ratio.&#xA;What I found that made FastPFor challenging to understand is that it has a lot of state that you need to keep track of. What I described so far is a single block, but FastPFor operates over sets of numbers, and so needs to tie all of them together.&#xA;At any given point, FastPFor has:&#xA;&#xA;The block that is being outputted&#xA;The metadata about the entire process&#xA;32 arrays of exceptions&#xA;&#xA;The process interleaves all of them together in interesting ways, and I had a hard time figuring out how it all ties together.&#xA;Let&#x2019;s talk about the way FastPFor processes a single block. We process the data in the array in blocks of 128 numbers at a time, like so:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Then, we use the bc value to record the metadata about the block.&#xA;That is an array of bytes with the following format:&#xA;&#xA;Packed number of bits&#xA;Number of exceptions&#xA;&#xA;If there are exceptions for this block, we also add:&#xA;&#xA;Maximum number of bits&#xA;Offset of exception in the block (repeated as the number of exceptions)&#xA;&#xA;The metadata is shared for the entire encoding operation, across blocks.&#xA;You can see in the code that if bestcexcept (which holds the number of exceptions) is greater than zero, we find the appropriate exceptions buffer to use. That requires a better explanation.&#xA;the getBestBFromData() call gave us two important data points, the best number of bits to pack the numbers, and the maximum number. We are going to pack all the numbers in the block to the output, but what about the exceptions? Where do they go?&#xA;It turns out that we need to store the exceptions, but we don&#x2019;t actually need to store max bits, only the difference between the best number of bits and the maximum. This is what thisexceptioncontainer is holding, the remainding bits for exceptions. It&#x2019;s important to understand that this is done across blocks. So the thisexceptioncontainer value holds exceptions from many different blocks. That will turn out to be very important in just a little bit. We then scan the block and write the remainding bits to the container, and write to the metadata the offset of the value in the block. Since we are using blocks of 128 numbers, this is ensured to fit inside a byte.&#xA;The last step that we do for the block is to call: packblockupsimd(), this ends up calling to simdpack() and packs all the numbers from the block to bestb bits in the output.&#xA;It&#x2019;s really important to understand that we still have two data items that haven&#x2019;t been written. The first is the metadata for the encoding process (bits in blocks, exceptions offsets, etc). The second is the set of exceptions themselves.&#xA;This process repeats itself for each block, until the end of the buffer. It is at this point that we need to write the remaining data to the output. Here is what the code looks like:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

This is dense, and it takes a while to unpack (pun intended) what is going on here.&#xA;First, we write the size of the metadata and then we copy the metadata that we have to the output. That is the description of all the blocks that we just went over. Then, we run over the set of exceptions that we gathered. Remember, the datatobepacked is an array that holds lists of exception data for each bit range that we have to store. We iterate over all the bit widths where we wrote exception data and generate a bitmap. That will help us later during the decoding process.&#xA;Finally, we run over the same exceptions and write them out. Note that we do that using the same simd bit-packing approach as the rest of the code.&#xA;The end result is that we have the following format:&#xA;&#xA;For decoding, we start from the metadata offset and jump to that. Then we read the exceptions bitmap. That tells us how many exceptions we have and how many bits we have in each one of them. In the image above, you can see that we have 3 exceptions list, for 4 bits, 12 bits and 19 bits.&#xA;We use the simd bit-packing to decode those values into memory. We&#x2019;ll need them shortly.&#xA0; Now, we start iterating over the metadata, each block has an overhead of minimum two metadata bytes (number of bits and number of exceptions). Let&#x2019;s assume that we don&#x2019;t have any exceptions in the block. In that case, the process of decoding is simple. Just do the unpacking from bits to numbers and you are done.&#xA;If we have exceptions, on the other hand, we have to deal with them. At that point, the next metadata byte would contain the maximum number of bits for the exceptions in this block. Using that and the normal number of bits, we can tell where the extra bits are located. Here is the relevant code:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

In that case, we don&#x2019;t need to store the data, we already know what the value is then (it&#x2019;s one, after all). So we can compute it once and set it in the output.&#xA;For scenarios where we can&#x2019;t tell from the bit width along, we read the relevant exception array based on the difference between the bits in the block and the exceptions bits. That gives us an array that is shared across blocks. The idea is that the metadata contains the offset in the block, and we read from the relevant array one item at a time. This two-step process will result in us setting the right value and getting ready for the next call, which may be done in a different block.&#xA;Note that the exception bits buffers only care about the number of bits, not where they come from. So two blocks, which have (bestb: 4, maxb: 9) and (bestb: 7: maxb: 10) will both go to the 3 bits container.&#xA;Okay, this blog post is getting long enough, so I think that would be it. Hopefully, it will make it easier to understand exactly how the FastPFor format is working. I&#x2019;m going to be talking more about FastPFor and the format implications in the next post, then move on to actually using that in C#.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I talked a bit before about the nature of bit packing and how the simdcomp library isn&#x2019;t actually doing compression. Why do I care about that, then?&#xA;Because the simdcomp library provides a very useful building block. A simple set of functions that allows you to very quickly pack and unpack bits. That is important, since those operations are fast enough that we can treat them as effectively free. Once that exists, we can now start finding interesting usages for those.&#xA;Let&#x2019;s assume that we have the following functions:&#xA;&#xA;Pack(Span&lt;uint&gt; input, Stream output, int bit);&#xA;Unpack(Stream input, Span&lt;uint&gt; output, int bit);&#xA;&#xA;It get a set of numbers and the number of bits and encode or decode them as needed.&#xA;Because those methods are&#xA0;fast, it means that we can play with various interesting designs. For example, let&#x2019;s take dictionary compression. Assume that we have a set of values, such as country names. This looks like this:&#xA;&#xA;[ &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Japan&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Japan&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot;, &#x2026; ]&#xA;&#xA;This array contains thousands or millions of entries. We want to encode that in an efficient manner, how can we do that?

What is the actual cost here?&#xA;We&#x2019;ll assume an average country name of 8 bytes, to make the math easy. That means that to store the list of countries would cost us 38MB, if we did that using the most obvious approach.&#xA;Using the code above, assuming 30 unique values, we&#x2019;ll have 5 million values with 5 bits each, leading to a total cost of about 3MB, instead of 38MB.&#xA;The nice thing about this approach is that once you have fast bit-packing routines, you can now start using them in all sorts of interesting ways.&#xA;The reason I talked about the topic before starting to discuss FastPFor is that it makes a lot more sense to understand how bit-packing can be applied separately from FastPFor, since that is just making interesting use of the capability.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In the last post, I talked about how the simdcomp library is actually just doing bit-packing. Given a set of numbers, it will put the first N bits in a packed format. That is all. On its own, that isn&#x2019;t very useful, we have to pair it with something else to make it do something more interesting.&#xA;Previously, I talked about delta compression, what if we put both of those together?&#xA;Given a sorted list of numbers, we&#x2019;ll compute the delta between the numbers, then we can figure out how many bits we need to store them, and we can pack that tightly.&#xA;Analyzing the sample posting list I&#x2019;m using, we get the following batches (of 128 numbers each)&#xA;&#xA;328 batches at 13 bits&#xA;11 batches at 22 bits&#xA;7 batches at 23 bits&#xA;3 batches as 27 bits&#xA;1 batch at 31 bits&#xA;1 batch at 28 bits&#xA;&#xA;Doing the math, we can fit all of those using 77Kb or so.&#xA;The idea is that for each batch, we can use simdpack() to write just the relevant bits. We&#x2019;ll need some extra metadata to keep track of the number of bits per batch, but that is just one byte per every 128 values. For that matter, we can bit-pack that as well .&#xA;Note that in this case, we are using the simd packing routines just for bit packing. The actual compression aspect comes not from the packing, but from computing the deltas and then figuring out how densely we can pack those values.&#xA;This approach is called Frame Of Reference (FOR), and it has some really nice advantages. By splitting the data into blocks, we can take advantage of the patterns in the data. Here are the first 16 deltas in the posting list:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Value&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Bits&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[0]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;1871143144&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;31&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[1]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[2]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[3]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[4]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[5]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[6]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[7]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[8]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[9]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[10]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[11]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;7984&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;13&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[12]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[13]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[14]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;[15]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;4&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;3&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Let&#x2019;s assume that the batch size is 4 numbers, what would be the numbers here? Basically, we take the max number of bits for each batch of 4 numbers.&#xA;The first block will require us to use 31 bits, the second would be just 3 bits, but the third would require 13 bits and the last is 3 bits again.&#xA;The idea is that for each block, we have a separate frame of reference, the number of bits that are required for us to record &amp; retrieve the data.&#xA;Of course, if you&#x2019;ll look at the data itself, we are wasting quite a lot of space here needlessly. There are just two numbers (0, 11) that require more than 3 bits.&#xA;There is an algorithm called Patched Frame Of Reference (PFor) that handles this. Basically, when we compute a batch, we&#x2019;ll record it using 3 bits only in this case. What about the rest of the values? Those we&#x2019;ll store outside the batch, as an exception. On reading, we&#x2019;ll need to patch the data to make it whole.&#xA;That adds a bit of complexity, but it also means that you can compress the data a lot more densely.&#xA;In the next post, I&#x2019;m going to be talking about FastPFor, which combines simd bit packing, patched frame of references and some really clever tricks to get a very interesting integer compression algorithm.</p>
