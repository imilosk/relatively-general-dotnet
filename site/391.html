            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As we are getting ready for the RavenDB Conference, our team is actually starting to show the fruits of all of this hard work. For example, take a look at the new studio replication UI configuration. There are a lot of things like that, and I am really pumped to see all the disparate things that we have been doing over the past year come together and join up into a single and very pretty picutre.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We got a call to the office.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;We have a huge problem with our system, you need to come and help us right away. This is a critical system and we need immediate response.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That kinda of annoying, of course, but it is all part of the service. So, in order to log the appropriate items into our system, we asked:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;What is your order id? And what is your support contract number?&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And the answer was:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;Oh, that was handled by another department, I&#x2019;m not sure.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;So we asked them to figure that out and send it to us, and waited. The call came at noon, but 7 PM, I sent them an email.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The reply I got back was:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;We&#x2019;ll try to find the order details tomorrow.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I guess it isn&#x2019;t so huge, critical and immediate problem any longer&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">For a long time, xUnit&#x2019;s dev has resisted adding support for skipping a test dynamically. You could create your own Fact class and handle that yourself, but that was quite a lot of work, for something very specific. In RavenDB, we had the need to dynamically decide whatever the test can run based on the actual test situation, so I decided to add this to our xUnit fork. This turned out to be really simple to do.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As you probably know, we have the RavenDB Conference coming up in a few weeks. This is the very first conference that we are doing, and to say that we are excited would be a major understatement. We are going to have speakers talk about RavenDB from all angles. From the development team (including yours truly) to the operation guys behind RavenHQ as well as customers and consultants that can share their real world experience about how to best utilize RavenDB. The idea is to have an intimate gathering, and for the very first time, to actually have direct way to talk with all of our users, as well as share a lot of the stuff that happens behind the scenes. Not to mention, we crave feedback, and several key features of RavenDB were actually proposed by the community and then implemented by us. I was reviewing the registration numbers for the conference and it looks like we have made a&#x2026; miscalculation. The idea with the conference was to charge just enough to ensure a commitment to come, to avoid the plague of free conferences where many people sign up and most never come. We even offset things so you can pay 89$ for the conference and you get a 90$ coupon for RavenDB. On the side, since we are already there, we also setup an additional 3 days course for an in-depth look at RavenDB. But we had a lot more demand for the conference and the course than we thought we would have. We currently have just 2 places open for the course, and about 15 &#x2013; 20 places open for the conference.  Since the course is more expensive, that was a the kind of surprise that is actually kinda nice to have: &#x201C;Wait, you mean that they are giving us more money than we thought they would&#x2026;&#x201D;  At any rate, I find myself in the strange situation of encouraging people to go and buy the cheaper product, simply because we are really going to have no more room for the course soon. You can register here, I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing you all.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The interesting thing about the etcd / go-raft review wasn&#x2019;t so much what they did, they did things quite beautifully, but the things that I wanted them to do that they didn&#x2019;t do. The actual implementation was fascinating, and for the purposes of what is required, more than adequate. I, however, have a very specific goal in mind, and that means that this is really not going to work with the given implementations. I&#x2019;ve better explain first. I&#x2019;m not sure if go-raft was written by the same people as etcd, but they do &#x201C;smell&#x201D; very much the same. It just occurred to me that yes, they are actually both on github, so I checked it appears that I was correct. xiangli-cmu, philips, benbjohnson and bcwaldon (among many others) have worked on both projects. The reason this is important is that this reinforce my feeling that go-raft was written mainly to serve the need of etcd. Anyway&#x2026; The reason that I think that is that the implementation is very much optimized at the level etcd needs it. What I mean is that there is a lot of work there to support multiple concurrent operations that would be batched to all the nodes in the cluster, then be applied in the in memory model. This work because etcd is a set of key/value pairs that are shared among many nodes, but they are usually very small values, and very small number of keys. I would be surprised if there were hundreds of thousands of keys in a single etcd installation. That just isn&#x2019;t the type of thing that it is meant to do. And that reflects throughout.  For example, there is an inherit assumption through the codebase, that the data set is small, the each value is small, etc. When sending a snapshot over the wire, there is the assumption that it can all fit in memory and that this is a good thing to do so. Even more to the point, the system where we only push entries to the nodes on heartbeats is great when you are trying to batch multiple changes together, with each change being independent of all the others (usually). However, that really doesn&#x2019;t work when what you actually need is something like the sort of things that we usually deal with. I want to emphasize that I&#x2019;m really evaluating the way etcd &amp; go-raft are built and find them wanting for my own purposes, I think that they are doing quite great for the kind of problem that they are meant to solve. Let us consider the kind of databases that we have. We usually have to deal with much larger values, typical documents are in the KB range, and are frequently hundreds of KB in size. We also tend to have quite a lot of them. Trying to put them all in memory (the etcd way) would be&#x2026; suboptimal. Now, one option would be to try and do just that, and have each operation in RavenDB (put/delete documents) as a state machine command in Raft. The problem is that this really gets complicated very quickly, leaving aside the fact that it isn&#x2019;t a general solution, and we really want to try to get to a general solution.  We don&#x2019;t want to solve this once for RavenDB, and then for RavenFS, and then for&#x2026; etc. And the reason that working at that level is tricky is that you need to push everything through the state machine, and everything in this case really does mean everything. That lead to a very different database design and implementation. It is also probably not really necessary. We can drop this a level or two down and instead of dealing at the database level, we can deal with that at the storage layer level. This is basically just an extension of the log shipping idea. Instead of using Raft for high level commands, just use Raft to create a consensus around the sequence of writes to the journal. That means that all the nodes will have the same journal, and thus have the same data in the storage. That in turn means that an &#x201C;entry&#x201D; can actually be pretty large (mutli MB range, sometimes). And because the journal is purely sequential, we need to issue that command to all the nodes as soon as it is submitted to the Raft state machine.  Now, the reason that the go-raft implementation waits for the heartbeat is that it batches things up nicely, and really speed up the general case. But we don&#x2019;t need to do that for what we are going to do. Or, to be rather more exact, we have already done just that. That is basically what Voron&#x2019;s transaction merging is all about. And since we can only handle writes as the leader, and since we will merge concurrent writes anyway, that is going to end up as a very similar behavior under load, and faster without load. At least that is what the initial thinking is saying. Snapshots, also something quite important for Raft, can be handle very simply by just doing a backup/restore over the network, by streaming all the data.  And the rest is just implementing Raft .</p>

The actual velocity is increasing by leaps &amp; bounds. We can do a lot more now, and we can do that faster and with a greater degree of parallelism. My personal development is growing less, as I am doing a lot more of business type things. One aspect of that is that I do a lot of reading of contracts, legalese, and other stuff that takes time from actual development work. I try to compensate by running the tests while I&#x2019;m reading contracts, and then I found the following in a contract I&#x2019;m reviewing:  Nice to know where that stand. And I emphasize.</p>
