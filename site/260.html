            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The RavenDB 4.0 book is going really well, this week I have managed to write about 20,000 words and the current page count is at 166. At this rate, it is going to turn into a monster in terms of how big it is going to be.The book so far covers the client API, how to model data in a document database and how to use batch processing in RavenDB with subscriptions. The full drafts are available here, and I would really appreciate any feedback you have. Next topic is to start talking about clustering and this is going to be real fun.I&#x2019;m also looking for a technical editor for the book. Someone who can both tell me that I missed a semi column in a code listing and tell me why my phrasing / spelling / grammar is poor (and likely all three at once and some other stuff that I don&#x2019;t even know). If you know someone, or better yet, interested and capable, send me a line.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I run into the following in a PR I recently reviewed. Take a look and try to figure out why I&#x2019;m pointing this bits out:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Those are bad errors. In the sense that they are hiding information. Sure, in 90% of the cases the user just put it the backup location or the restore location, so they know what the application is referring to. But the other 10% is looking at the exception from the logs, having &#x201C;I got an error&#x201D; support call or all sort of weird stuff.&#xA;In particular, one of the most annoying things is when the user and the application disagree on a relative path. If the user believes that the relative path is based on one location and the application another, hilarity ensues. But not in a fun way.&#xA;A better way to prevent all of those would be to just include the actual locations (fully resolved, mind) in the error. It doesn&#x2019;t prevent support calls, but it does make them a lot easier to solve.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After the last three parts, I think that I have a good high level understanding of what is going on in the Noise codebase, as a reminder, I&#x2019;m reviewing 48d808375e541eca383826ea928272976bce064d.I love reading code, especially stuff that I&#x2019;m not familiar with, such as a new platform or doing something novel. The Noise codebase is quite interesting, and it is a very early stage in the project. That said, when looking at what it is doing and comparing to what I&#x2019;m doing in my day job, a few things popped up.I couldn&#x2019;t help but think that this is a very similar model to the default Azure DocumentDB. All the data is indexed, and the values are shredded as they go in. The model you use was very similar. The nice thing about this kind of model is that it gives you a lot of freedom and flexibility, but the downside is that if you need more, there aren&#x2019;t any alternatives. Storing large JSON documents inside Noise is likely to cause problems, especially if you are typically working with the full document. If you are just throwing things into it and then pulling back pieces, especially if the documents you write are relatively small, this is likely to be much more suited. Noise is making some clever usage of the LSM nature of RocksDB to do cleanups, and I really like the elegance of the indexing engine. The query model is also interesting, in that it gives you a lot of freedom to operate. Select the right fields, define the appropriate aggregation, etc. But queries are limited (no computation) and aggregation queries are going to run with cost of O(N) with respect to their results. Given that this is intended to be embedded, and apparently into low end devices, that might very well be the right decision.A side affect of the shredding is that you need to reconstruct documents all the time, since they were broken into component parts. Things like scanning results by one field while returning another looks like they can generate O(N * log N) number of queries in RocksDB. I&#x2019;m not sure how much that can scale with regards to queries. On the one hand, there are very clear layers between the pieces of the code, which is great, but that also have some built in issues with regards to how much performance you can squeeze out of the system. I don&#x2019;t have a feeling for Rust code performance, nor do I think that the project is ready at this early stage for performance analysis, but it is a concern. Then again, I did just spent the past two years head down in a major performance work, so that might very well be the reason. And it is entirely possible that the code will perform significantly better when the project is done.One last thing to note, when I tried building a replacement to Lucene one of the annoying thing to pop up was that it is really hard to replace Lucene efficiently and still be better in term of time / space / complexity. Noise in particular is storing all the data at least twice (once as terms to be searched, once as the actual document data). This make is very easy to do certain operations (such as update a document), but it also means that the cost of updating a document is now doubled. We first need to index the new document, then we need to re-index old document, compare between the two and then write the changes. I guess that it is possible that reducing the amount work to be written would help matters, but the cost of indexing is likely to dominate. I would expect a Noise index to be significantly larger than the Lucene equivalent, because Lucene does a lot to reduce file size (in quite evil &amp; nasty ways, to be fair). Another thing that I don&#x2019;t think that is good is the reliance on a query language in an embedded solution. A much better idea in my option would be to expose the raw documents out and let the client handle it. If it is running in the same memory space, there is no extra cost. This is because the moment that this open up a huge number of features / issues. I&#x2019;m talking specifically about the notion of &#x201C;return&#x201D; here. The idea is really cool, you can project exactly what you want from the document, and that allows the engine to only pull the relevant data.At any rate, this is really getting late now, so I&#x2019;ll close with the note that Noise is a really cool codebase to read. Even if you don&#x2019;t know Rust, going ahead and reading something non trivial is a really good exercise in learning new things. And I&#x2019;m really interested in what Noise is going to do next.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">After the previous two parts, I think that I have a good high level understanding of what is going on in the Noise codebase, as a reminder, I&#x2019;m reviewing 48d808375e541eca383826ea928272976bce064d.Now I&#x2019;m reading through the JsonValue file. The first interesting thing here is:Given all the code I have read so far, I think that this is a really elegant way to handle JSON, both in terms of how you can define such a recursive structure in 7 lines of code and in how this allow you to express relatively complex scenario quite nicely.One thing that bugs me is that there are a lot of things like this:This is done to have enough space for escaping. The problem is that this waste quite a bit of space. The last few blog posts I had were about 2KB of text each. Imagine doing a batch of a few thousands of them, just this types of calls can take up a lot of extra memory. Now, I&#x2019;m used to managed memory, where this kind of thing hangs around and need to be collected. This code is in Rust, and it will clean itself up as soon as it is out of scope. But given that we hold on to it for a non trivial amount of time, I think that it is a concern. It might actually be cheaper to go over the string multiple times to figure out exactly how many escape chars we need. One of the first optimizations we did when we wrote our own JSON parser was get rid of the costly escape char handling. It took literally more time than anything else, because we kept having to scan the string and break it over and over again.Another issue that popped up is here:A silent assumption here is that the order of properties in the two objects is the same. Two identical objects that have different property order will sort unequal. That is likely to be a surprise to the user.The next file is parser.rs, which is over 1,300 lines of code (almost 20% of the entire codebase of Noise!), this is pretty typical parsing code, low level, nasty and quite tedious. I skimmed it briefly, but I don&#x2019;t think that there is anything really important going on there. Its main purpose is to take a query string and produce a filter, next.The next file is query.rs and I&#x2019;m going to assume that this will lead me to also jump to filter.rs which I previous skipped.The code here start using terms that I&#x2019;m familiar with from Lucene. We&#x2019;ll start where the money is, in Query::get_matches, which starts by building the query itself:Basically, create a snapshot of the index, parse the query. We need to pass the snapshot to the parser so it can pass it on to the filters that it builds internally. The order of operations in this code also determines the required order of appearances of the clauses in the Noise query syntax.The rest of the method goes over the query and build it, setting up ordering, aggregation and such. There is close cooperation between query.rs, filter.rs and snapshot.rs. The query is a high level concept of everything that must happen, filter is a much lower level, just finding the right stuff. On top of that the query layer boosting, scoring, ordering and aggregation. The filter uses the snapshot to access the stored information. For example, the AllDocsFilter is using the snapshot.new_all_docs_iterator, which is defined as: Basically, scan all the values with the prefix of S, which I think stands for sequence number. More complex stuff can be seen in the Scorer, as a good example. We have terms prefixed with C, which I think stands for Count, which gives the number of times that a particular term appear in a particular position. And K is the number of times a particular property has shown up in general. This seems to be the basis of tf-idf calculation. Those are merged together using RocksDB merge command and the custom merge policy that we looked at in the index.rs. At this point I looked at the clock and realized that this is now after midnight and that I got to the most interesting parts that I wanted to see, the rest are pretty familiar details, since a lot of this follows the Lucene construction. I&#x2019;m going to have another blog post about my thoughts about this project, which will show up tomorrow.</p>
