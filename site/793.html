Because when you are integrating OSS tools, you are wasting your time. When you integrate TFS, you are being enterprisey.    (Yeah, cheap shot, sorry, can&#x27;t help it)</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Bil Simser has a few things to comment about me and Roy&#x27;s discussion about TFS vs. the OSS stack:Yes, other packages out there are extensible by nature (Subversion for example) but require coding, architectural changes, hooking into events, all of which are nice but systems like this were not designed for it.     That depends on what you want, but usually coding is not involved, scripting usually does. Arhcitectural changes, etc, are usually not involved.Was subversion really designed at the start to be extensible so I could maybe have my storage be in a relational database rather than the file system?    I am not familiar with SVN&#x27;s internals, but I would answer yes, it already has two storage providers, adding a third should be possible.&#xA0;Let me turn that question around for a moment, can I extend TFS to use Oracle as the backend storage?Could I crack open subversion to support a way to link checkins to an external feature list? Sure. Why would I when TFS has this already.    And since Subversion has this already, the point is moot at any rate.    And finally, the piece that caused me to post it here:As for modifying open source systems to do your bidding, you enter into a fork scenario. Unless the system supports a plug-in pattern and you can just add a new assembly (like say oh the TFS policy sub-system) I really can&#x27;t do much with a tool even if I have the source code, unless I want to run the risk of being in a maintenance nightmare from Hell scenario. Do I really want to do diffs of new relases of NUnit with my own code to support new extensions.    Forking isn&#x27;t nice for you, and I would usually recommend against it. But the point is, most OSS projects already have an extension model. NUnit certainly does, Rhino Mocks does, Subversion does, NHibernate has them all over the place, Castle Windsor is a big (and beautiful) extensibility model all in itself, log4net lets you plug in at any point in the pipeline, etc.    In fact, that is one of the reasons that I like OSS, because so often they have this really nice model of safely extending the functionality. Bil mentioned extending TFS to include a &quot;steps to reproduce&quot; field, here is the same for Trac:[ticket-custom]    repro = textarea    repro.label = Steps to repreduce    repro.cols = 60    repro.rows = 30    Very simple to extend, and if I wanted to add logic as well, that is simple to do as well.And while it might have deficiencies in various places I can plug in new features or introduce entirely new concepts to the repository so that I can make it match whatever business process I use.    TFS makes me wait for it, that doesn&#x27;t mesh with the way I do business. Please instruct me at the values I should put in the &quot;MakeIsFast.config&quot; file.Is the source control system in Team Foundation Server extensible or replaceable? No, but I&#x27;m willing to live with a few problems while we get to version 3.0.    I think that you under estimate just how critical this deficiency is to me. It makes me snap out of the zone. It makes me aware of the tool, and not in a good way. If a tool get in my way I would either improve it or throw it.</p>

Regarding my last post, Oren (Ayende) points out that regarding TFS&#x27;s features, he can either find a match for them in open source land, or he doesn&#x27;t really care about them.                 What bugs me is whether, assuming you can find and create such a solution out of a package of open source applications working together that operate with the same level of integration as TFS, can you still handle the things that matter to the organization using your solution.         I believe that I can, and we have been doing this for the last several projects that we built. Roy lists some interesting points about choosing the development stack: Maintainability: Granted, it&#x27;s not easy to maintain a TFS installation, but it sure as hell just as&#xA0;hard if not harder to maintain a full range of open source tools, each one from a different publisher, different versions and compatibilities, documentation and support services (if at all).     About 6 months ago I had a go at installing and configuring Trac for Wiki/Issue tracking. It took me a few days to grok the way it works, but we have been using it ever since.&#xA0;The last time that I had to administer it was three months ago, when we had to open a new project, and it tooks three minutes on the phone to deal with that.     There is a reason why I keep coming back to Zero Friction. That is what I get from my stack of OSS tools. They are there, and they are working, I use them when I need their services, at all other times, they don&#x27;t get in my way.     TFS gets in my way, I accidently clicked on the Team Explorer band on the right side and it hung&#xA0;VS until it connected to the server and did&#xA0;something that is of absolutely no interest to me at the time. Annoying in the extreme, shove me out of the zone, and makes me feels out of control. Controlling Your Environment Makes You Happy! Learning curve: I have no doubt that 9 times out of 10, it is harder to get up to speed on an open source product than a commercial one (there are always exceptions). Double that by the number of different products you are using and see what you get. Usually the documentation is not as good, and the support contract (if exists) is very poor as well. The efforts to maintain the source code and create your own version might actually be higher than what you are trying to save. And no, I don&#x27;t think it will still be less that the cost of a commercial product (TFS or otherwise)     I am probably in no position to disagree (biased), but I still disagree. I could come up with a few examples, but they would fall into the exceptions clause, so I would just say that it is usually rare to maintain forked version for a long period of time, and usually not necessary. OSS usually has better solutions for this (well defined extension points, for instance).     In fact, I can say that synergy between OSS projects can cause some really sweet results. I have profiling and tracing for NHibernate built on top of log4net, and the NHibernate Search deal is really sweet. That said, I am using a lot of commerical tools because they are better/easier then a comparable OSS project. My reasons may be different, though. I am using SQL Server because Management Studio is a nice UI (although I wish it would still some features from PL/SQL Developers), WCF because it has good UI for logging, etc. Ease of use: Usually I find that Open source products tend to be less usable than commercial ones. Money does matter. Yes, there are always exceptions. Actually, Eclipse is an IDE I find more usable than VS.NET. But then again, Eclipse&#x27;s community is funded as far as I know. Money matters.     No argument here. The final coat of paint care make a lot of difference, and it usually takes some money to really get all those nooks and cranies.     That said, there is another element of ease of use that should be considered, and that is the simplicity of the architecture, the assumptions being made about the amount of time that is going to be invested in it, etc. The Entity Framework (to take an example at random) can afford to be complex and ungainly, because they can cover the ugly stuff with pretty designer, an OSS project is usually not at liberty to do so, and as a result, would arrive at a much simpler solution to the same problems. If you found subversion to be working too slow for you, what are the odds you&#x27;d go hack the code for yourself to get a better version? then update it with every new drop? what would be the cost of that?     I don&#x27;t think that Subversion being slow is the case here, but I will answer anyway.     I know C and C&#x2B;&#x2B;, so yes, I would. I wouldn&#x27;t need to update it with every new drop, I would submit the patch to the core team, and then have it there forever.    What is the cost of that vs. a commerical product (which is not slow in theory only)? Well, 0 for the software, and some high amount for spending time hacking at the source to make it faster.&#xA0;What is the cost for doing the same with commercial product? Some initial high amount (although probably less than than the hacking would be), then contiual bleeding of time as a result of problems that I can&#x27;t fix. But you know that this comparision is flawed, because Subversion is not working too slow for me (and it is known to scale much better than TFS).It&#x27;s quite easy to say &quot;I&#x27;m not using this because of X,Y,Z&quot;. It&#x27;s quite a different story to say &quot;I know it has it&#x27;s problems, but looking at the bigger picture I owe it to myself to see if I can find a way to work with it despite of the shortcomings&quot;     And it is another story yet again when to say, &quot;I know a different solution, which can give me all that I need/want, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with those shortcoming.&quot; The bigger picture as I see it is that I get everything that I want, and don&#x27;t have to waste my time on patching holes in the tools that I use. Tools should be transperant, not road blocks.But slamming on a tool just because some parts of it are not the fastest is just wrong. The Source control is still one of the strongest ones I&#x27;ve seen in terms of features. discounting it would mean underestimating a product that actually has much value.    Let me put it in the simplest terms that I can, TFS puts me out of the zone. That is simply unacceptable, period. If I need to be aware of &quot;Don&#x27;t go near the Team Explorer Tab, it will hung VS for 5 seconds&quot;, I am not in the zone. If I am not in the zone, I rarely get to code well. Beyond that, the source control in TFS doesn&#x27;t offers anything that I haven&#x27;t seen before, not in terms of features, and not in terms of the UI for them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Roy responded to my post about disliking TFS:            I think that Oren is making one big mistake: he&#x27;s throwing the baby out with the bath water. Just because the source control is not as zero-friction as some open source alternatives, does not mean that TFS is not a valuable suite of tools, with more added value than most open source tools that I know of.                [List of advantages that TFS has snipped, will cover them later]                I mean, Oren, c&#x2019;mon! You don&#x2019;t like a part of a part of team system &#x2013; the source control aspect is not perfect for you, but what alternative do you have for a suite of tools that works together so powerfully?        First of all, I am grateful that I am only making one big mistake :-) That said, I don&#x27;t really have an issue with the rest of TFS, but the problem is that without the source control integration, it is losing quite a bit of its charm. The source control is the most visible and annoying part of TFS, I would love to give it a short with SVN integration, but I don&#x27;t really see it coming.     Roy goes on to list a few points, which I would get to cover:The ability to associate a work item with a check-in action is very powerful in determining and reporting &#x201C;delta&#x201D; between failing builds    Just about any bug tracker has this ability, it is not unique for TFS by eany means. Usually it is a matter of a few config options for SVN and a post-commit hook.Builds are also connected to checkin, and build history allows you to &#x2018;drill down&#x201D; to see all the source differences between the last success build and the current failing one    This is nice, but it won&#x27;t work with anything other SCM, so that it not very good. I can get that with Trac as well, so that is not something that really bothers me.The ability to use &#x201C;workspaces&#x201D;, which map current source control into local directories is powerful because it allows you to work concurrently on multiple versions of the same product, and switching between them in a couple of clicks from the IDE    Bug, not a feature. You can&#x27;t move the folder around, you have cruft left over in your system, deleting the folder won&#x27;t rid of the remains, etc. Beside, what is the problem with &quot;MyProd\trunk&quot;, &quot;MyProd\Branch-1.0&quot;, etc?            Powerful automated reporting                 Distributed and extensible build capabilities                 Task and bug management         All of which are nice, but by no mean unique or even very impressive on their on.Also, it&#x2019;s still a version 1.0 product, and you know that version 3.0 is usually the one to remember, but as a version 1.0 product, and compared to most OSS tools (working together), VSTS gives me something that I find hard to get anywhere else &#x2013; true collaboration.    Actually, no, I don&#x27;t. And I flat out refuse to suffer the initial pain for the promised land. Feel free to call me heretic.    The promise of TFS is that you get everything integrated, in one package. The problem of TFS is that you get everything integrated, in one package. I actually like the work items, and if I could get it outside of VS (don&#x27;t your dare make the IDE any slower), I would like it better. The problem is that I can get as much and more from freely available projects, that works in zero friction.    And you know what, I can get them to work together in the same time it takes to setup TFS.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been slacking my OSS duties recently, spent a whole lot more time relaxing than anything else. It was fun, but it had to end sometimes. It ended when the &quot;to do&quot; list got over 50 items. At that point I knew that I had to do something or drown under the sheer amount of stuff that I postphoned. I decided to dedicate some time over the weekend to weed out the todo list. Not surprisingly, quite a few of the todos were related to OSS projects I contribute to.     There are at least&#xA0;three major things here:            Cloning / traversal of criteria queries, which, in conjuction with...            Multi Criteria Queries - can produce some really interesting results, and deserve their own post.            NHibernate Query Analyzer UI upgrade (thanks to Sheraz Khan)    Here is a taste of what is new in NQA:        Anyway, here is the full list, releases will have to come at a later time, I am feeling tired. Off to a non techincal meeting, that should give me enough reason to want to write code that I actually paid for :-)    NHibernate:            NH-987 - SQL 2005 views used in SQL 2000 dialect        Now using select 1 from sysobjects where id = OBJECT_ID(N&#x27;{0}&#x27;) AND parent_obj = OBJECT_ID(&#x27;{1}&#x27;)            NH-831: Adding MultiCriteria        Fixing a bug with MultiQuery and the second level cache, where each query pagination status wasn&#x27;t taken into account when retrieving from the cache.            Moving to Dynamic Proxy 2 (Patch by Adam Tybor)        Removed the TODO in NHibernateProxyHelper, at last :-)            NH-924 - inspection of criteria.            Fixing spelling error from previous commit            NH-988 - Proxy validator should complain on non-virtual internal members        Applied patch by Adam Tybor    Castle:            (validator) Added a way to override message definition using external resources file.            Fixing the build (that I broke in last commit)            Allowing to get the interceptors for a proxy (NHibernate needs this).            Revert unnecessary change to BasePEVerifyTestCase                 DYNPROXY-58 - Inherited interfaces - FIXED.            DYNPROXY-56 - workaround for CLR serialization bug, applied patch from Fabian Schmied            (Windsor)&#xA0;Fixing spelling mistake            Adding passing test case for IoC-73.            (Brail) Fixing MR-248 - Pre-Processor Issue            MR-247 - Brail uses different keys for putting and getting items from the compilation cache.    NHibernate Query Analyzer:            Much better support for AR:        &#xA0;- Version insensitive        &#xA0;- Can handle merged assemblies        &#xA0;- Can handle pluralizeTableNames            Applied patch from Khan, Sheraz - Adding tree of entities and properties tree.            Updating NHibernate to trunk        Updating tests to work against the new version.            Final touches to tests.    Rhino Mocks:            Applied patch from Ross Beehler, adding more smarts to Validate.ArgsEqual            Fixing an issue with mocking objects with protected internal abstract methods.            Adding (passing) test case for mocking interfaces with generic methods that has constraints.            Removing 1.1 legacy collections.            Fixing an issue where internal interfaces could not be mocked in strongly named assemblies.            Adding license header to all the files.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Interestingly enough, Subversion support is the most requested feature for CodePlex. I suggest reading the discussion, it is very interesting. The major points against TFS and for SVN seems to be:            Weak offline access support            No patching            No anonymous access    The points above makes TFS a poor choice for an OSS project, which requires all three (but especially anonymous access and patching). For corporate scenarios, there is another advantage to Subversion over TFS. Subversion is a Zero Friction tool, TFS is anything but. A memorable quote can be found here:Source control is a utility.&#xA0; It&#x27;s a tool.&#xA0; It should help you do what you need and stay out of the way when it&#x27;s not.&#xA0; I love developer tools, which is probably why so many of my open source projects involve building new ones, but I firmly believe that if you have to ever think about the tool then the tool is not doing it&#x27;s job.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I found this mostly by accident, but it looks like a few weeks ago CodePlex has lost the source&#xA0;code&#xA0;for some of the projects hosted on the site.&#xA0;I would like to address&#xA0;the part about &quot;free means no guarantees&quot; that came up in the post:CodePlex is a free service.&#xA0; They&#x27;ve provided complete source code hosting along with one heck of a website and never asked for a cent in return.&#xA0; So, I really can&#x27;t hold it against them.    I would.     Regardless of the legalese involved. I have certain expectations from such a service. And having reliable backups is one of those. I don&#x27;t care if it is free, SourceForge had ensured that there wouldn&#x27;t be much point in charging for source control for open source projects, so I am not surprised that it is offered as a free service.     CodePlex&#x27;s stated goals are to host and support open source projects, I assume that it is also meant to show off Microsoft&#x27;s technologies. That is nice, except that the fact that&#xA0;a project is OSS doesn&#x27;t mean that its source is not mission critical data that really should be safe.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Roy is hiring Team System people, I was amused by the post title:We&#x27;re hiring Team System People - Are you passionate enough?    The answer it my case would be &quot;Yes, to avoid it&quot; :-)     And the reason would be that it absoutely not a zero friction tool.    As long as we are talking about Roy, he posted a poll about mocking frameworks&#xA0;for his upcoming book about unit testing. I am impressed by the amount of votes (and the comments) for Rhino Mocks, thanks.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I just run into this post, that talks about a presentation about mocking, and included this statement (about using Rhino Mocks):I once heard a story about a developer so retarded that he and his team spent a good amount of time trying to debug a mock only to find out that he forgot about ReplayAll()*.&#xA0; Who hires guys like that anyway?    That developer, it would be me, and it can happens quite often. And I wrote the tool, so I should know what I am doing when I am using it.     Stuff happens, it is easy to forget a line of code and waste some time as a consequences. The most common sentence from me when I am developing is &quot;Oh, man, I am so stupid that I did that&quot;.    To give an example that would be a bit easier to grok, what is wrong with this code:            using(TransactionScope&#xA0;scope&#xA0;=&#xA0;new&#xA0;TransactionScope())        {        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Appointment[]&#xA0;appointments&#xA0;=&#xA0;SpanOnCalendar(appointmentSepc,&#xA0;DateTime.Today,&#xA0;DateTime.Today.AddDays(7));        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;foreach(Appointment&#xA0;appointment&#xA0;in&#xA0;appointments)        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;appointment.Save();        }</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Christian Maslen ping me about this article, which shows how to use NHibernate to execute multiply statements in a single round trip. Christian suggest a much neater solution:            SELECT&#xA0; C.*,                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; COUNT(*) OVER() AS TotalRows                        FROM&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Customers AS C        I was sure that it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it does, and I consider this extremely cool. So, now I needed to figure out how to make NHibernate understand this. There are several options, but extending HQL is simplest one in this case.    NHibernate uses a dialect to let bridge the gap between Hibernate Query Language with is a database agnostics relational/object querying lanaguge. This allows NHibernate to work against multiply databases easily. The key here is that one of the extension points that NHibernate is offering is the ability to define your own custom functions, which can translate to arbitrary SQL.     In this case, here is the query that I want to end up with:            select b, rowcount() from Blog b        Here is the dialect extension:            public class CustomFunctionsMsSql2005Dialect : MsSql2005Dialect                        {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; public CustomFunctionsMsSql2005Dialect()                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; RegisterFunction(&quot;rowcount&quot;, new NoArgSQLFunction(&quot;count(*) over&quot;,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; NHibernateUtil.Int32, true));                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; }                                }        We register a new function, called rowcount, which translate to &quot;count(*) over&quot; string. The final &quot;()&quot; are added by NHibernate when rendering the function. Now, we need to register our new dialect:            &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.dialect&quot;&gt;MyBlog.Console.CustomFunctionsMsSql2005Dialect, Blog.Console&lt;/property&gt;        And here is the code we end up with:            IList list = session.CreateQuery(&quot;select b, rowcount() from Blog b&quot;)                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; .SetFirstResult(5)                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; .SetMaxResults(10)                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; .List();                                foreach (object[] tuple in list)                                {                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Entity: {0}&quot;, ((Blog)tuple[0]).Id);                                &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Row Count: {0}&quot;, (int)tuple[1]);                                }        The generated SQL is:            WITH query AS (                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; SELECT TOP 15 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) as __hibernate_row_nr__,&#xA0;                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; blog0_.Id as Id4_,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; blog0_.Title as Title4_,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; blog0_.Subtitle as Subtitle4_,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; blog0_.AllowsComments as AllowsCo4_4_,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; blog0_.CreatedAt as CreatedAt4_,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; blog0_.Id as x0_0_,                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; count(*) over() as x1_0_                                 &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; from Blogs blog0_)                                 SELECT * FROM query                                 WHERE __hibernate_row_nr__ &gt; 5                                 ORDER BY __hibernate_row_nr__        Oh, and thanks for Fabio Maulo for helping me figure out the correct usage of custom functions.</p>
