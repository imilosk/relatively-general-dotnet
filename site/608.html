        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Fowler has a post about DSL, which contain the following:  The first is in language design. I was talking with a language designer who I have a lot of respect for, and he stressed that a key feature of languages was the ability to define new abstractions. With DSLs I don&#x27;t think this is the case. In most DSLs the DSL chooses the abstraction you work with, if you want different abstractions you use a different DSL (or maybe extend the DSL you&#x27;re using). Sometimes there&#x27;s a role for new abstractions, but those cases are the minority and when they do happen the abstractions are limited. Indeed I think the lack of ability to define new abstractions is one of the things that distinguishes DSLs from general purpose languages. I disagree with the statement that this is an exception. This is something that come up again and again in a DSL. You start with a given concept of what you want to do, and you give it to the users. Rinse &amp; repeat a couple of time and you have a language that the users can start play with. The main problem is that not giving the users that facilities for abstraction usually mean that they will work around your system, or that the DSL scripts that you will have will suffer from copy &amp; paste, unnecessary complexity, etc. A trivial example would be how to define customer roles. You want to be able to process orders based on customer role, and as such, it is important to be able to define how you choose a customer. Not only that, but even the customer selection criteria should be abstracted. Here are a few examples:  Bad customer:  Bad credit rating OR More than 5 returns last year OR More than 5 helpdesk calls last 6 months Silver Customer  More than 5 purchases Gold Customer  Total purchases over 5,000$ Preferred customer:  Not a bad customer Gold customer We want to define roles using other roles. Because that is how the business thinks about it. We naturally create abstractions for ourselves, because this is how we think. If we need to go back to the development team for each new abstraction, we have a heavy weight process that the users will work around. Most of my DSL contains some form of user define abstractions, usually in the form of: define bad_customer:&#xA;&#x9;customer.HasBadCredit or &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;customer.TotalReturnsIn(1.year) &gt; 5 or&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;customer.TotalHelpdeskCallsin(6.months) &gt; 5&#xA;&#xA;define silver_customer:&#xA;&#x9;customer.TotalPurchases &gt; 5&#xA;&#xA;define gold_customer:&#xA;&#x9;customer.TotalPurchasesAmount &gt; 5000&#xA;&#xA;define preferred_customer:&#xA;&#x9;gold_customer and not bad_customer&#xA;&#xA;This is usually user editable, and we plug this into the intellisense of the system. In one project, I even provided a refactoring support, Extract Business Term (bound to CTRL&#x2B;ALT&#x2B;V, go R#!)&#xA;Abstractions are important, and building them into the language is just as important. You want to empower the users to extend your language, even if it a language that is very limited in scope. Because you give them the option to take the language to realms that you never dreamed on.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">My post about tests got the expected response, and I think that Denis&#x27;s comment is a good sample of the type of feedback that I got:  ...you won&#x27;t be able to ship periodically at sustainable costs and quality without relevant engineering practices like unit tests, refactoring and continuous integration... Despite several attempts in repeating that, it seems like many people missed the part that I explicitly stated: I wasn&#x27;t trying to say that tests are not valuable. I was trying to talk about the blind faith that people put in tests. Now, to Denis&#x27;s comment. Yes, I would be able to ship periodically without tests.  I am not talking in the air, I have the practical experience and two years of a running project to back me up on that. We had a CI process in place, which deploy the application to a staging server, and that was it. Refactoring... is not a subject that I can talk about in the context of this application without first explaining the architecture. I came to that project shortly after finishing up a project that was... problematic. And I was determined to avoid the same mistakes. One of the first thing that we did was to define the core parts of the system, and build just enough of that to serve us. So far, this is normal, except that we added a tiny twist.  We applied the Open Close Principle as a holistic view for the entire project. If we needed to change a line of existing code, that was a bug, and we had to refactor that area of the system to make sure that the next time we need to change this, we wouldn&#x27;t have to change existing code. Adding a new feature consisted entirely of adding new code. We didn&#x27;t touch existing code. Well, not very often, to be honest. This is the same project where I spent three months straight without even once going to the infrastructure directory, indeed, after three months we run into a problem, and it took me 10 minutes to remember that we are using a container in the app, and that the new class didn&#x27;t match our convention, so Binsor did not register it. A lot of my ideas about zero friction development came directly from this project. Because we always wrote new code, and each feature was isolated from all other features, we were able to keep a rapid pace of development for the lifetime of the project. I mentioned that we didn&#x27;t have automated tests, we didn&#x27;t feel the lack. Off the top of my head, I can&#x27;t recall any regression bugs that we had, except with infrastructure going bad (IT admins removing our shared storage, BizTalk changes we weren&#x27;t told about, stuff like that). I am pretty sure that there were some, but I can&#x27;t think of any, so that put them at a very low number. And some stats about the project. It is running for 2 years (I left after the first year, and the team continued to provide new features and releases after I left), currently at over 200,000 lines of code, is considered a major success from the business point of view and its scope has tripled since the original inception. And just to reiterate, I like tests. I think that they are important and that they have proven themselves in the field. BUT, They aren&#x27;t a silver bullet, having them wouldn&#x27;t make the project succeed. And not having tests wouldn&#x27;t make the project fail.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Over a year ago I became disinterested enough in NQA that I decided to deprecate it.  In a true Open Source tradition, Hudson Akridge, Robert Dusek and Ricardo Borges stepped in and took ownership of the project. You can find the new project at this location: http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/NHibernateQueryAnalyzer They already have a new version out for the current version of NHibernate.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the tickets for NH Prof is styled menu items. I was testing that, and I noticed something very strange and worrying. I&#x27;ll show it to you:   Clearly, I thought, this is some left over from some tests being done that wasn&#x27;t cleared. Then I had a &quot;slap my forehead&quot; moment. I can&#x27;t really do it well on the blog, but imagine me zooming out to show a bigger picture. &#xA0;   Um, yeah, there is a bug, but it is between the chair and the keyboard.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been quite on that front for a while, but not because we stopped working on that, but because we were quietly adding features and polishing what we have to reach a whole new level. Some of those features are not yet complete, but we have one feature that is good enough to show.  Analysis In this case, a picture is worth significantly more than a thousand words.  Here is one of the analysis modes that we support, showing you all the unique queries that you application perform.   But wait, there is more. The (tentatively named) View By Method: &#xA0;   This features should both allow you to gain a much higher level of understanding in regard to how exactly you are using NHibernate. Not to mention that these also give you a high level overview about what is going on. What do you think?</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In DevTeach, we had a panel that Kathleen Dollard has covered in depth, in which we talked about what the bare minimum aspects of Agile project would be. The first thing that was thrown up was testing. That is quite predictable, and I objected to that. One of the things that bother me about much of the discussions in the agile space is the hard focus of tests. Often to the exclusion of much else. My most successful (commercial) project was done without tests, and it is a huge success (ongoing now, by the way). A previous project had tests, quite a few of them, and I consider it a big failure (over time, over budget, overly complex code base, a lot of the logic in the UI, etc).  Update: I wanted to make clear the distinction between Agile and TDD. I consider the project without tests to be a fully agile project. The project with tests was a heavy waterfall project. I think that I can safely say that it would be hard to accuse me of not getting testing, or not getting TDD. Not that I don&#x27;t expect the accusations anyway, but I am going to try to preempt them. I want to make it explicit, and understood. What I am riling against isn&#x27;t testing. I think that they are very valuable, but I think that some people are focusing on that too much. For myself, I have a single metric for creating successful software:  Ship it, often. There are many reasons for that, from the political ones and monetary ones to feedback, scope and tracer bullets. Tests are a great tool to aid you in shipping often, but they aren&#x27;t the only one. Composite architectures and JFHCI are two other ways that allow us to create stable software platform that we can develop on. Tests are a tool, and its usage should be evaluated against the usual metrics before applying it in a project. There are many reasons not to use tests, but most of them boil down to: &quot;They add friction to the process&quot;. Testing UI, for example, is a common place where it is just not worth the time and effort. Another scenario is a team that is not familiar with testing, introducing testing at this point would hinder my topmost priority, shipping. Code quality, flexibility and the ability to change are other things that are often attributed to tests. They certainly help, but they are by no mean the only (or even the best) way to approach that. And finally, just to give an example, Rhino Igloo was developed without tests, using F5 testing style. I applied the same metric, trying to test what it does would have been painful, therefor, I made the decision not to write tests for that. I don&#x27;t really like that code base, but that is because it is strongly tied to the Web Forms platform, not because it is hard to change or extend, it isn&#x27;t. Okay, I am done, feel free to flame.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This is a post about Oxite, but it is actually not about the code base. There has been a lot said about this, and I think that I can solidly put myself on the side that spouts WTF and now seeks access to memory altering drugs.&#xA;What I wanted to talk about here is actually the way that this was handled. It didn&#x27;t take long for people to start noticing the actual code quality of this in contrast to its marketing promise:&#xA;&#xA;  We heart you so much, that we thought of everything. Oxite was developed carefully and painstakingly to be a great blog sample, or a starting point for your own web site project with CMS needs. Its line-up of sexy attributes includes: provider-based architecture allowing you to swap out database and search providers (SQL Server DB, local and Live search providers included), built for testability and hence most likely to be voted &quot;hottest in class&quot; by TDD fans (repositories, everything has an interface, etc.)&#xA;&#xA;The community reaction was mostly negative, especially since this was positioned as official sample application. The marketing for Oxite is actually quite amazing, when you consider that they have a channel 9 show, a visit mix site, a really nicely done codeplex site, a push from Microsoft evangelist and other things that I forget.&#xA;Very quickly, there was a response from more well known sources at Microsoft. It is interesting to watch the actual phrasing of the responses from those people. You have to admire the level of verbal acrobatics that they had do do. Again, I am more interested in the back story than in the code.&#xA;Scott Hanselman has this to say about the way Oxite was released:&#xA;&#xA;  I don&#x27;t know the Oxite guys, and I didn&#x27;t know they were working on anything. Thing is, anyone at Microsoft can put a project together, blog about it, and say &quot;this aims to be a good example of...&quot;. Clearly it&#x27;s not a good example and it shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as one.&#xA;  &#xA;  The fact that PhilHa, who owns ASP.NET MVC, didn&#x27;t know it was going on, kind of makes that point. Any samples from Microsoft that intend to show a Best Practice should be reviewed by Phil, and certainly vetted by the community. David Nelson nailed that point clearly.&#xA;&#xA;I think that this is really interested. &quot;Anyone at Microsoft can put a project together and...&quot;&#xA;Well, actually, no, they can&#x27;t. Oh, they can do that for personal stuff, but they can&#x27;t do that for Microsoft stuff. I had the chance to work with the P&amp;P a couple of times, and I had the pleasure of seeing the release process from their side. Some of that is unique for P&amp;P, I assume, but there are things that are certainly shared for all of Microsoft. A security review, for example, or the bloody annoying trademark stuff that give us names such as Windows Pillow Foundation Community Extended Express Edition for Professional Database Developers And Administrators 2008 R4.2.&#xA;There are other things, and among them, especially if you put out a best practice app, is to actually talk to the team that own this.&#xA;So, they can&#x27;t do that. Or, to be rather more exact, they shouldn&#x27;t have done that. Except that it appears that they did, I can see no other option given the information that is publicly available. Because there is absolutely no question that Oxite has been extremely damaging to Microsoft from a PR perspective. The worst part is that it was pushed as &quot;we thought of everything&quot; and &quot;hottest in class&quot;.&#xA;We can compare those to Scott&#x27;s BabySmash or to Rob Conery&#x27;s Storefront (although I don&#x27;t believe that even at their worst, they would have made me cry). Those were clearly labeled as learning projects, and that made all the difference.&#xA;Which bring us to the current state of affairs. Scott Hanselman said something that I utterly disagree with about this:&#xA;&#xA;  Oxite is Open Source. If you don&#x27;t like it, and there are very valid reasons today for concern, I would sincerely encourage you to refactor it and share the results.&#xA;&#xA;Open Source is not a way to get other people to fix bad code. I think that this is the wrong thing to do. However it got there, this was published with the impression that Microsoft is standing behind it. While my response would have been to kill the project, remove the site and deny that it has ever existed, Microsoft has chosen to keep it alive. I believe that by doing so, and I think that they have done so by not either killing the project or officially stating that this is not a Microsoft project, that Microsoft is now accountable for this project quality and its fitness to serve as an example application.&#xA;And yes, I do mean that what looks very much like a rouge project being released into the wild is now Microsoft&#x27;s problem to fix. See above for the difference between stating the source (Microsoft vs. individual) and the effect that it has on the perception of the project.&#xA;Rob Conery&#x27;s has picked up the ball and seems to be making rapid progress at it, judging from his twitter stream.&#xA;I think that this is the best solution all together. We get to see a good restructuring approach, and knowing Rob, we will end up with a good sample app. More to the point, that was the appropriate response to what happened.&#xA;It also has another side effect, which is pretty major one, it turning all that negative PR into a positive one, by stepping in, acknowledging the problems and fixing them.</p>
