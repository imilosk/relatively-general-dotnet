            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Just minutes after I posted the previous post about dog fooding and the issues this has, we run into major trouble. Actually, several issues. The first of which was that we started to get authentication issues, but even though we upgraded the server, we didn&#x2019;t change any security related configuration. So what was going on? I tried logging in from my own machine, using the same credentials as the server, and everything worked! I then tried replacing the credentials to ones I knew worked, because they were being used by another system with no issues, and that didn&#x2019;t work either. Looking in Fiddler, there were no 401 requests, either. Very strange.  This ended up being an issue of lazy requests. Basically, a lazy request is one that carry multiple requests in a single round trip for the server. We changed how we handle those internally, so they look pretty much like any other request for the code, but it appears that we also forced them to go through authorization again, and obviously that didn&#x2019;t work. Once we knew what was going on, fixing this was very easy. The next issue was a little crazier. Some things were failing, and we weren&#x2019;t sure why. We got an illegal duplicate key from somewhere, but it made no sense. What was worse, it appear to be happening in random places. It took me a while to figure out the root cause of this issue. In RavenDB 2.5, we tracked indexes using the index name. In RavenDB 3.0, we are tracking indexes using numeric ids. However, the conversion process between 2.5 to 3.0 didn&#x2019;t take that into account, and while it gave the existing indexes ids, it didn&#x2019;t set the next index id to the correct value.&#xA0; When we would try to create a new index, it would generate an index id that was already existing, and that failed.&#xA0; The error could crop up when you run a dynamic query that had to create a new index, so that was kind of funky.  The last error, however, is something that I consider to be purely evil. RavenDB 3.0 added a limitation that an index cannot output more than a set amount of index entries per document. The idea is that we want to stop the fan out problem. An index with high fan out can consume a lot of memory and other resources without control. The idea was that we want to explicitly stop that early on. But what about existing indexes? We added a way to increase the limit explicitly, but old indexes obviously wouldn&#x2019;t have this option. The problem was that this is only triggered on indexing, so you start the application, and everything works. Then indexing starts to fail. Which is fine, but then we have another RavenDB feature that applies, and if an index has too many errors, then it would be marked as failing. Failed indexes throw when queried. The reason that this is evil is because it actually takes quite a bit of time for this error to surface. So you run your tests, and everything works, and a few hours or days later, everything crashes. All of those issues has been resolved. I found that the index id issue was actually properly there, but I appear to have removed it during an unrelated fix to the previous problem without noticing. The lazy requests now know that they are already authenticated and the maximum size when loading from an existing system is 32K, which is big enough for pretty much anything you can think of. The behavior when you exceed the max fan out is also more consistent, it will skip this document, and only if you have a lot of them will it actually disable the index. And yes, pushing things to ayende.com and seeing what breaks is a pretty good testing strategy, egg on face and all.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We just finished rolling back our internal servers migration to 3.0 back to 2.5. That was quite unpleasant, and was actually noticed by users.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That isn&#x2019;t pleasant, but it is always better if we get the egg all our face than if it is a customer. The actual issue that we run into was pretty interesting.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The problem is that the database we use for running this blog (as well as most of our internal systems) has been through&#x2026; a lot. It has gone through pretty much every released version, and many that weren&#x2019;t actually released.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That means that from storage perspective (only of interest to RavenDB developers), it is a bit of a mess. That in turn meant that we had to do extra work to convert the storage from the 2.5 version to the 3.0 version. That caused enough memory to be used that we hit our limits on memory usage, and failed to convert it to the 3.0 version.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That meant that it was stuck. That is actually one of the reasons that we test those things on our own systems, so that was great.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The not so great part was that we also uncovered another interesting bug (actually, several of them in conjunction). The new studio had a tendency to read the stats from all the available databases, if the number we had was small enough. That was done so we can show the number of documents on each database in the databases page.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;That meant that we would effectively start all of them in parallel (and consume resources that weren&#x2019;t actually needed).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;And that, in turn, exposed a race condition (in Esent!) that can resulted in a hard process crash. That was the hardest thing to get over with, because obviously we don&#x2019;t have source access to Esent and it was kinda of hard to pinpoint where this was actually happening and why.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;All fixed and good now, and ready to try again.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We do a lot of compiler work in RavenDB. Indexes are one such core example, where we take the C# language and beat both it and our heads against the wall until it agrees to do what we want it to. A lot of that is happening using the excellent NRefactory library as well as the not so excellent CodeDOM API. Basically, we take a source string, convert it into something that can run, then compile it on the fly and execute it. I decided to check the implications of using this using a very trivial benchmark:private static void CompileCodeDome(int i)&#xA;{&#xA;    var src = @&quot;&#xA;class Greeter&#xA;{&#xA;static void Greet()&#xA;{&#xA;System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;&quot;Hello, World&quot;&quot; &#x2B; &quot; &#x2B; i &#x2B; @&quot;);&#xA;}&#xA;}&quot;;&#xA;    CodeDomProvider codeDomProvider = new CSharpCodeProvider();&#xA;    var compilerParameters = new CompilerParameters&#xA;    {&#xA;        OutputAssembly= &quot;Greeter.dll&quot;,&#xA;        GenerateExecutable = false,&#xA;        GenerateInMemory = true,&#xA;        IncludeDebugInformation = false,&#xA;        ReferencedAssemblies =&#xA;        {&#xA;            typeof (object).Assembly.Location,&#xA;            typeof (Enumerable).Assembly.Location&#xA;        }&#xA;    };&#xA;    CompilerResults compileAssemblyFromSource = codeDomProvider.CompileAssemblyFromSource(compilerParameters, src);&#xA;    Assembly compiledAssembly = compileAssemblyFromSource.CompiledAssembly;&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;private static void CompileRoslyn(int i)&#xA;{&#xA;    var syntaxTree = CSharpSyntaxTree.ParseText(@&quot;&#xA;class Greeter&#xA;{&#xA;static void Greet()&#xA;{&#xA;System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;&quot;Hello, World&quot;&quot; &#x2B; &quot; &#x2B;i &#x2B;@&quot;);&#xA;}&#xA;}&quot;);&#xA;&#xA;    var compilation = CSharpCompilation.Create(&quot;Greeter.dll&quot;,&#xA;        syntaxTrees: new[] {syntaxTree},&#xA;        references: new MetadataReference[]&#xA;        {&#xA;            new MetadataFileReference(typeof (object).Assembly.Location),&#xA;            new MetadataFileReference(typeof (Enumerable).Assembly.Location),&#xA;        });&#xA;&#xA;    Assembly assembly;&#xA;    using (var file = new MemoryStream())&#xA;    {&#xA;        var result = compilation.Emit(file);&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;I run it several times, and I got (run # on the X axis, milliseconds on the Y axis):&#xA;&#xA;The very first Roslyn invocation is very costly. The next are pretty much nothing. Granted, this is a trivial example, but the CodeDOM (which invokes csc) is both much more consistent but much more expensive in general.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Chapter 6 isn&#x2019;t something that I actually planned to write. I thought that I would be writing a high level guide into how to use and utilize RavenDB indexes. What came out was a detailed discussion on the actual RavenDB indexing process, including a deep look into the kind of environment that we have to deal with, the type of design decisions that we had to make and the balancing act between competing demands. I don&#x2019;t know if anyone would be interested in actually reading it, since it is quite low level, and it wasn&#x2019;t a lot of fun to write. It is really hard to summarize six years of operational experience into a few words. It is even harder to show you the final result and discussing that without the full history of &#x201C;we tried this, and that, and that as well&#x201D;. But I think it ended up okay. You can get it in the following URL.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned that we are looking for more people to work for us. This time, we are looking for WPF people for working on the profiler, as well another hush hush project that we&#x2019;ll hopefully be able to reveal in December. Because we are now looking for mostly UI people, that gives us a different set of challenges to deal with. How do I get a good candidate when my own WPF knowledge is limited to &#x201C;Um.. dependency properties, man, that the bomb, man, yeah!&#x201D;. Add that to the fact that by the time people got an interview here, we want to be sure that they can code, that present an interesting problem. So we come up with questions like this one. Another question we have is the large text viewer. We need a tool that can work with text file (logs) of huge size (1GB &#x2013; 10 GB). We want to be able to open and search through such a file.  Nitpicker corner: I usually use this tool for that, the purpose of the question isn&#x2019;t to actually to get such a tool, it is to see what kind of code the candidate writes. We are looking for someone with a lot of skill in the UI side of things, so the large text file stuff is somewhat of a red herring, except that we want to see what they can do beyond just slap a few text boxes around.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We are still in a hiring mode. And today we have completed a new question for the candidates. The task itself is pretty simple, create a form for logging in or creating a new user. Seems simple enough, I think. But there is a small catch. We&#x2019;ll provide you the &#x201C;backend&#x201D; for this task, which you have to work with. The interface looks like this: public interface IUserService&#xA;{&#xA;        void CreateNewUser(User u);&#xA; &#xA;        User GetUser(string userId);&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;public class User&#xA;{&#xA;   public string Name {get;set;}&#xA;   public string Email {get;set;}&#xA;   public byte[] Sha1HashedPassword {get;set;}&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;The catch here is that we provide that as a dll that include the implementation for this, and as this is supposed to represent a 3rd party service, we made it behave like that. Sometimes the service will take a long time to run. Sometimes it will throw an error (ThisIsTuesdayException), sometime it will take a long time to run and throw an error, etc.&#xA;Now, the question is, what is it that I&#x2019;m looking to learn from the candidate&#x2019;s code?</p>
