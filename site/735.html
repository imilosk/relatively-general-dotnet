            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Casey commented on my post about ALT.Net and the Enterprise, and we have a good discussion going on there. But something he said triggered so many red flags that I had to go breath into a paper bag for a few moments:  many &#x27;enterprise&#x27; teams have to take whatever body count they can get to satisfy the management. And in that case you have to keep things really simple (and by definition produce poor quality code). He later went on to expand what he think is simple:  In case I expressed myself badly ... by simple in that context, I mean simple as in &quot;mostly drag and drop&quot;, no IoC, no inheritance, no composition, lots of &quot;standard things&quot; like EAAB, and most code in the aspx.cs files ... because that is as far as most developers understand code. &quot;simple code&quot; in the context I suspect you mean it is probably as I would define it... which is the hardest code in the world to write. The simpler the code is, the harder it is to write.  High quality code is simple, elegant and to the point. Keeping things simple means making it easy to go the right path. Thinking that keeping things simple is by definition producing poor quality code is a mistake. I am afraid that I can&#x27;t really find any simplicity in &quot;mostly drag &amp; drop, most of the code in the aspx.cs&quot;.&#xA0; In fact, it is far more complex than the alternative, because you have to juggle so many balls at the same time. Here is a piece of simple code: [Occurrences(OccureEvery.Day, At = EsitmatedRunTime.MidMorning, RunAtHolidays = false)]&#xA;public class SendSmsTwoDaysBeforeEventStart : ScheduledTask&#xA;{&#xA;&#x9;public override void Execute()&#xA;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;ICollection&lt;Event&gt; eventsInTwoDays = Repository&lt;Event&gt;.FindAll(&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Event.ScheduledDate.Between(InTwoCalendarDays, InTwoDays) &amp;&amp; &#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;Where.Event.Participants.With(FetchMode.Join)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;foreach(Event e in eventsInTwoDays)&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;{&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;SendNotificationSmsToAllParticipantsIn(e);&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;}&#xA;&#x9;}&#xA;}&#xA;It is easy to write, easy to read, and it is stupid code. You can write &amp; test this in a short amount of time, and it lends itself greatly to a check list approach. &quot;Here are the batch processes we need to build right now, here is how you build a batch process, let me know if you have any issues and when you are done&quot;. Very simple code, quite elegant, if I say so myself, but nothing that you need to really think about when you build it.&#xA;Keeping things simple means higher code quality, period. Making them complex any tiny bit over the necessary, and your code quality will plummet.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Simone Chiaretta has a post that I strongly disagree with. The two parts that sum the parts that I most vehemently disagree with Simone are:  imagine you have an Enterprise-level project, with 100 developers, how many of them are likely to grasp what IoC is? And:  if you have 50 developers in your team you can&#x27;t use MonoRail or Windsor or even the kind of main-stream NHibernate, because 40 of them will not know what you talking about. There are two reasons that I disagree, let us start with the one that had forced me to sleep on this post rather than send it immediately. The underlying assumption here is that &quot;Morts can&#x27;t take this stuff&quot;. It annoys me a great degree, because this is both arrogant and baseless. Those &quot;alternative&quot; concepts that we are talking about are not born of thin air, they are the de-facto standard of operation in many shops.  Let us focus for a second on the Java camp, shall we?  I would be greatly insulted if anyone tried to claim that Java developers are intrinsically better than .NET developers. But for some reason, those concepts - IoC, MVC, OR/M - that Morts can&#x27;t ever figure out, are not only popular there, they are they default choice in many cases. And they are the choice for large, Enterprise projects. So, what is the difference between the two? Why can Java people scale those concepts to large teams and .NET people can&#x27;t? The answer is that there is not real reason except a common misconception about the capabilities of developers to learn &amp; grow. By assuming the &quot;they can never understand that&quot; attitude, you are limiting what you can do and form an elitist view of your developers.  I am pretty sure that this isn&#x27;t what Simone intended, but this is how I view the general sentiments in that direction. Now, I mentioned that I have two reasons to disagree. The second part is my own experiences working with those tools &amp; concepts. All my projects for the last 2.5 years or so have been using IoC and OR/M, the last two are using MVC as well. I don&#x27;t work alone, and I work with people of varying degrees of knowledge and interest in the technology for the sake of technology. The reason for doing that is simple, it works, and it helps produce successful projects. I have an answer to &quot;How does it make my job easier?&quot; and I have successful projects to back this up. You can see what kind of code we are writing right now, IoC, OR/M and MVC are easier than the other way around. And it is my responsibility to make sure that (a) the developers understand what is going on but (b) they shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with it on a day to day basis. Properly used, IoC is completely transparent&#xA0;to the application. OR/M is not transparent, but it is very easy to use, and I want to split the code between the controller &amp; the view. So yes, you can scale this up to hundreds of developers. In fact, I can&#x27;t really imagine other ways to manage this complexity without using those concepts.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Did you noticed? Most of the guidance about tools are about how to get you started, but much more light on how to get going in the face of real world scenarios. NHibernate is no exception in this regard, so you can find a lot of information about getting started, but far less on how to actually deal with it. So this is a official solicitation of&#xA0;interesting NHibernate issues that you have run into. When I first thought about it, I figured out that querying was where most of the interest lay (that is certainly where I mostly sit back and say &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I just did that so easily&quot;), but mapping issues, or dealing with general problems are also welcomed. A question should include the problem statement and the scenario and a description of the entities / database in question, if they are relevant. I may contact you for more information regarding this problem. Here is an example of a question that I can&#x27;t really do much about:  How can I make NHibernate skip persisting unsaved entities? This is problematic because you have already arrived to the conclusion of what you want to do, but I have no idea what you are trying to do, or why. Often, there are other ways to do the same thing, but without the scenario, I can&#x27;t tell. A better way to ask this question is:  We have a &quot;Simulation Mode&quot; in our applications, in which a user can do things to the application without really affecting the system, for trying things out. We want to use the same code as we use for the real thing, but we must not save to the database, obviously. How can I stop NHibernate stop persisting my entities? This gives me enough background to know to tell you to go to set session.FlushMode to FlushMode.Never. So, post those problems here, and I&#x27;ll try to give coherent solutions to them.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, as I mentioned, I was doing low level binary IO stuff today, and I started the class going on doing stuff using BitConvertor, FileStream.Write, etc. After they finished the first exercise, I started to show them how they can replace this tedious code with BinaryReader / BinaryWriter. That was much easier, except that we had strings going into the binary files, and I stopped in the middle to try to read the file written using BinaryWriter with the code that manually manipulated the file stream. I got consistent results for numbers, but for strings it was giving weird results. I used the method of write string len (int) and then write string, but the BinaryWriter didn&#x27;t need that, and when I tried to just use the code that used it, it gave obvious shift errors. I pulled out reflector and checked out the code.&#xA0; The magic is in Write7BitEncodedInt,&#xA0; it handles splitting an integer into 7 bits, and use the last bit as a progress indication. After reading that and Read7BitEncodedInt, it was clear, and very clever. I was good to get down on such a problem, at least I haven&#x27;t lost all sense for bit twiddling code.  Can&#x27;t say the same for my UI / JavaScript code, however, spent nearly the whole week doing nothing of value, as far I as feel. I am considering moving to C&#x2B;&#x2B; again, hibernate&#x2B;&#x2B;, anyone? :-)* * For the humor impaired, the last paragraph is a joke, I don&#x27;t really intent to port hibernate to C&#x2B;&#x2B;.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Before watching the show:  It is great that we are finally seeing signs of changes  Technologically, doesn&#x27;t sound much different than MonoRail  Politically, great news  Not sure why everyone is raving about the routing support During:  Things I haven&#x27;t heard in Microsoft talk so far:   Unit Testing  Mocking  Not using the designer  &#xA0;Separation of Concerns  Maintainable by default My stuff that are being mentioned:   Brail  Rhino Mocks Leaving holes for the community to plug.  Great things that shouldn&#x27;t have caused excitement:   Clean URL  Clean HTML  Not using post backs It shows some nice possibilities of C# 3.0, I think that this is showing some new API styles that we can use in C# 3.0  Things that are complete surprise:   Getting a test project that support NUnit, MbUnit, etc Key phrases:   Not forced  Mockable  Testable  We should look into it IHttpRequest, sweet!  There was a lot of time spent on routing  A moment of bliss:   &quot;If you know MonoRail, it is the logical equivalent to layout&quot; - I had to say the reverse too often Server controls for this framework are just renderers. This means that I can plug them into MonoRail. After:  I need to do more C# 3.0 stuff, I actually installed Beta 2 while I watched the movie.  Routing is nice, and I like the idea of having is centralized, but I still can&#x27;t figure out why is was such a big thing. &#xA0; Summary: The MVC framework is fairly standard, there was another one a short while ago, ProMesh.NET, which much of the same capabilities. That was not the important part of the presentation as far as I am concerned. The important part was (a) awareness and (b) willingness to cooperate with the community. And that was the best news I had from Microsoft in a long while.</p>

What about bringing in WSDL definition at compile time?  import webservice from &quot;http://localhost/who/is.there&quot; as WhoIsThereService And then writing a small compiler step that does all the rest. Usually the first twenty or so lines of my my Windsor.boo file are just import statements, they really make it harder to read, why not split them to another file?  import all from imports.boo I can probably think of a few other interesting things to do with it, as well.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">While a DSL can really cut down the amount of code that you need to write, putting everything in one file is not a good idea. But I like my DSLs to be script&#xA0; like, without the need for an explicit compilation step. I have thought about it for a while now, and yesterday ago Craig Neuwirt* asked how it can be done using Binsor.  My default language is Boo, obviously, which is a static, compiled language that pretends that it is dynamic and scriptish, giving the best of all worlds. One of the cool things about Boo is that you can reference an assembly by just doing this:  import System.Data.SqlClient from System.Data  This make it very easy to write scripts, because you just declare things and they will be automatically referenced, without needing to pass parameters to the script runner. Now, I wanted to have some way to handle file inclusion as well. But Boo doesn&#x27;t support this. This is not something that you can do in a method, or dynamic loading, you have to do this as part of the compilation process. In a normal language, I would be left with building pre-processors, or doing heuristics to find all the relevant files that I want, or write an XML file that would detail which file I want to include. But Boo is not a normal language, it is a Super Language. It let me do what I want. And I wanted to have file references. So I did. I love Boo, I really do. The initial sample I started with was this. This is actually on the examples, what do you know. Then I thought about how I wanted to it, and I figured out that I can do this:  import file from&#xA0;&#xA0;anotherFile.boo Boo allows me to modify the compiler object model (AST) at compilation, so I just detect all the imports for the namespace &quot;file&quot;, and then I compile and reference that file. I can even do this:  import file from&#xA0;&#xA0;&quot;~/config/anotherFile.boo&quot; Where ~ is translated to the AppDomain BaseDirectory.  You can find the code here, about 100 lines of code, out of which around 30 could be YAGNIed away. Wasn&#x27;t very hard, and make me love Boo all over again, for what it allows me to do. * Who doesn&#x27;t blog, and&#xA0;a search for &quot;Craig Neuwirt blog&quot; brings back my blog :-) (hint)</p>
