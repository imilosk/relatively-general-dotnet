            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I really like the CLR. It is a great platform, it has a rich set of libraries, it has a lot of power and flexibility, and it was designed with multi language support in mind, which means that what you can do on the CLR vs. what you can do in your language are two different things.  It is just too bad that the default CLR language is C#. Now, that probably raised a few brows, and definitely some hackles. C# is a great language, I can hear you saying. Well, yes, sort of. If you thinks that holding the compiler&#x2019;s hands is a useful thing to do.&#xA0;Leaving aside the ability to extend the compiler, Boo has the following to offer us:  Syntactic sugar for common programming patterns - List, hash and array literals, object initialization, string formatting and regular expression matching are all first class concepts in Boo, with direct support for all of them in a natural manner.  Automatic Variable Declaration together with Automatic type inference &#x2013; the compiler takes care of things for you, instead of having to type the same thing over and over and over again. Some would say that this is bad, for them I would reply that they should try it first. It works.Take a look at this:  def random():&#xA;&#x9;return 4 # selected by dice roll, guaranteed to be random&#xA;val = random() &#xA;&#xA;Is there are reason that I would need to specify the type over and over again? The compiler can figure it out for itself and not bother you with it. If you want to get a compiler error, you can: &#xA;val as string = random() # will error about type mismatch &#xA;&#xA;Automatic type casting &#x2013; don&#x2019;t make me explicitly say it, figure it out for me. I&#x2019;ll have unit tests to check to cover me. &#xA;Duck typing &#x2013; Boo is a strongly typed language, but you can ask the compiler to relax those constraints at certain scenarios. It makes some things much more natural, especially since you have a way to get into this infrastructure and decide what to do at runtime. If we will take a simple example, let us look at the XmlObject and what we can do with it: &#xA;person = XmlObject(xmlDocument)&#xA;print person.FirstName&#xA;print person.LastName &#xA;&#xA;What we just did was resolve, at runtime, that we were asked to get the value of a property called &#x201C;FirstName&#x201D;, and we did. This is a trivial piece of code to implement. &#xA;Just those benefits present a significant improvement in the language experience, and we haven&#x2019;t even touched the extensible compiler yet.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, what is this Boo language anyway? I am talking about it fairly often, but I never explained, and I am going to assume that people aren&#x27;t following links :-)  Boo is an object oriented, statically typed language for the common language runtime with a Python inspired syntax and focused on language and compiler extensibility.  Boo is an Open Source project, released under the BSD license. This means that you are free to take, modify and use the language and its products in any way you want, without any limitation[1] .&#xA0;Rodrigo B. de Oliveira started the project, and since then grown in popularity. The project is active and continually evolving. At the time of the writing, the released version of Boo is 0.8. However, Boo seems to be following the trend of many open source projects, in that that it is not really rushing toward 1.0 release. Boo has been around for a number of years, and I have been using it for production for the last two years.  Production, in this case, means systems that move money around with my neck on the line. I have a high degree of trust in it, obviously. Beyond being a really malleable language, suitable for DSL. Boo is also a nice language to work with for day-to-day tasks. The SharpDevelop IDE project has support for Boo, so you get the usual benefits. There is an ongoing project to support Boo in Visual Studio, and I have an active interest in seeing support for that being established. I don&#x27;t much care for which IDE, but I want a standard, checklist driven way of getting a language running. Here is a secret, I tend to think and write in Boo, translating down to C# because I have to. Boo is a far more flexible language, and the ability to reprogram the compiler makes tedious tasks in other languages an amusing challenge. Those same tedious problems are usually overcome, to some degree, by throwing code generation at the problem until it goes away.  In Boo, we would usually tell the compiler how we want to handle this, and let the compiler take over from there. This is similar to code generation, except that this is done at the compiler level, which means that we have far more knowledge about what is going on. For example, let us say that we want to implement the singleton pattern. We need to do quite a bit of work to make it happen. Ensure that creating the singleton is thread safe, lazy initialization, make all the constructors private, ensure that serializable singleton remain singleton through serialization/deserialization, create static Instance property, have no static members on the singleton class. To do this in most language we would have to follow an implementation pattern and write fairly repetitive code. In Boo, we can capture this usage pattern in an AstAttribute (more on that later) that will do all of that for us, at the cost of a single attribute declaration. Similar capabilities allow correct usage of disposable, observable, and more advance techniques such as aspect oriented programming.  Some of the capabilities that Boo has can be had using IL Weaving tools such as PostSharp. The problem with those is that using them is something that happens after compilation. As a simple example, you would not be able to create a singleton in this manner, because you would not be able to generate the Instance property at the appropriate time.  Assuming that you want to use the singleton in the same assembly as it was defined, you will not be able to reference the Instance property, it will not exist until the post compile step has run. Boo, however, does this at compile time, so by the time the compiler get to the point where it is resolving the property, it has already been added.  In short, I really like the language and what it allows me to do.     [1] Well, if you are interested in creating a new language called Ba, you probably would want to make it clear where the project ancestry came from&#x2026;</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Two posts and a discussion yesterday has finally made it clear what my stance in regards to extensibility is. Extensibility is well and good, but if I need to extend a product from the get-go, just to get the basic functionality going, then this product blew it. The discussion that I had was about SSIS and the need to create a DateParserComponent. Basically, a wrapper around DateTime.ParseExact(). I don&#x27;t mind the work in creating it, but it is very telling that this is something that you would need. The posts that help cement this thinking were Phil Haack about Convection Controller&#xA0;and Ivan&#x27;s Filters implementation for the MS MVC framework. Let us start by saying that neither posts has code that I can take to production, and that is explicitly state in the posts. Demo code is demo code, after all. Nevertheless, I am going to talk about this demo code, and its implications. Phil has posted this Convention Controller as a way to show how easy it is to extend the MS MVC framework. The problem with that this is showing how to extend the MS MVC framework&#xA0;for demos. The code required to make this run for production is far more&#xA0;complex*. Production code has to be reliable, performant, stable, etc. A lot of effort goes into taking a piece of code from the proof of concept stage to the ready to production stage.  I believe that extensibility is extremely important. But that to answer of &quot;you can extend the product&quot; for any core scenario is nothing but blame shifting. I mean, Date Parsing in an ETL tool? Can you really consider that as a noncore scenario? Now, in order to avoid the hordes of people that this will offend. I want to make one thing clear, convention controller is not a core scenario for the MS MVC framework. That is a by design choice of them that I disagree with, but that is the way it is.  We now begin to see a lot of the MonoRail stuff appearing on the MS MVC side, Rescues, Filters, etc. I hope that most of them would end up with the core product, but MS has stated the MonoRail feature parity&#xA0;is not a goal. Just keep this in mind the next time that you are going to say &quot;it is extensible, do this&quot;, you really ought to consider whatever this is an answer that is driven by the product&#x27;s core scenarios vs. moving the work that should be yours to someone else&#x27;s hands. * This post is not about the convention controller, but to foretell the usual nitpickers, reflection is slow. Using un-cached reflection in a hotspot is a bad idea, even cached reflection is inappropriate at times.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here are a few thoughts about the idea that given a DSL, you can just turn your entire business related stuff to the business users, and be done with it. This kind of thinking is&#xA0;very common, from the dreams of the secretary building applicaitons by dragging boxes to the business analyst modifying the workflows. I disagree with this quite strongly. Giving a user this type of tool is an irresponsible step at best. The users are not developers, and they will make mistakes. And the first time that the business will lose money over it, it will be your fault.  It will be your fault when the server is on 100% CPU because the user has created endless loop. It will be your fault when the server is down because of stack overflow. It will be your fault that Mike from accounting made &quot;just a tiny modification&quot; that suddenly means that you sold a product with for 50% less than you paid for it. It will be you fault that Joe just got a paycheck proudly stating -43.9. It will be your fault that the company baught the entire fish market for the next three years. It will be your fault that no one has any idea what the company&#x27;s own business processes are. It will be your fault that the database contains incosistent data. It will be your fault that there is not control over it. It will be your fault that there hasn&#x27;t been an audit log for the last three months. It will be your fault Handing a user a tool like that is wonderful, it is a tool that can enable better communication and rapid response betweenthe IT and the business. Having a DSL means that you are talking in the same language, that you are less likely to mess up because of translation problems. It does not mean that you can just throw it over the wall and walk away. A DSL is code, and like all code, it requires code review, QA, change management (source control), testing, intention revealing semantics, perf testing, auditing, error handling, transaction handling and much more. Professional developers are having problems with handling that, giving it to unexperienced users is a mistake. It might work for the first few, but this is not&#xA0;a sustainable approach. Consider the departmental application and their usual bar of quality. Do you truly intend to bring that, knowingly, into your codebase?</p>
