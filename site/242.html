            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A couple of weeks ago we were done with the development of RavenDB, all that remains from now is to get it actually out the door, and we take that very seriously.To the right you can see one of our servers, that has been running a longevity test for the two months in a production environment. We currently have a few teams doing nasty stuff to network and hardware to see how hostile they can make the environment and how RavenDB behaves under this conditions. For the past few days, if I have to go to the bathroom I need to watch out for random network cables strewn together all over the place as we create ad hoc networks and break them.We have been able to test some really interesting scenarios this way and uncover some issues. I might post about a few of these in the future, some of them are interesting. Another team has been busy seeing what kind of effects you can get when you abuse the network at the firewall level , doing everything from random packet drops to reducing quality of service to almost nothing and seeing if we are recovering properly.One of the bugs that we uncovered in this manner was an issue that would happen during disposal of a connection that timed out. We would wait for the TCP close in a synchronous fashion, which propagated an errors that was already handled into a freeze for the server. Yet another team is working on finishing the documentation and the smoothing of the setup experience. We care very deeply about the &#x201C;5 minutes of out of the gate&#x201D; experience, and it takes a lot of work to ensure that it wouldn&#x2019;t take a lot of work to setup RavenDB properly (and securely). We are making steady progress and the list of stuff that we are working on grows smaller every day.We are now in the last portion, running longevity, failure tests and basically taking the measure of the system. One of the things that I&#x2019;m really happy about is that we are actively abusing our production system. To the point where if there there was Computer Protective Services we would probably have CPS take them away, but the overall system it running just fine. For example, this blog has been running on RavenDB 4.0 and the sum total of all issues there after the upgrade was no handling the document id change. The cluster going down, individual machines going crazy, taken down, network barriers, etc. It just works .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">We started some (minor) design work for the next set of features for RavenDB (as we discussed in the roadmap) and a few interesting things came out of that. In particular, the concept of the five pillars any major feature need to stand on.&#xA;By major I mean something that impact the persistent state of the system as a whole. For example, attachments, cmpxchng, revisions and conflicts are quite obvious in this manner, while a query is local and transient.&#xA;Here they are, in no order of importance:&#xA;&#xA;Client API&#xA;Cluster&#xA;Backup&#xA;Studio&#xA;Disaster Recovery&#xA;Update: There are six, not five. We also need to handle the interaction of Revisions with each feature.&#xA;&#xA;The client API is how a feature is exposed to clients, obviously. This can be explicit, as in the case of attachments or more subtle, like the CmpXchg usage, which can either be the low level calls or using it directly from RQL.&#xA;The cluster is how a particular feature operates in the cluster. In the case of attachments, it means that attachments flow across the network as part of the replication behavior between nodes. For CmgXchg, it means that the values are directly stored in the cluster state machine and are managed by the Raft cluster. The actual way it works doesn&#x2019;t matter, that we thought about the implications of this feature in a distributed environment has been discussed.&#xA;Backup is subtle. It is easy to implement a feature and forget that we actually need to support backup and restore until very late in the game. RavenDB has a few backup strategies, and this also include migrating data from another instance, long term behavior, etc. RavenDB has a few backup strategies (full snapshot or regular) and the feature need to work across all of them.&#xA;The studio refers to how we are actually going to expose a feature to the user on the studio. A good example where we failed in the CmpXchng values that are currently not exposed in the studio (there are endpoints for that, but we haven&#x2019;t got around to this). We are feeling the lack and it is on the fast track for new features for the next minor release. If a feature isn&#x2019;t in the studio, how do we expect a user to discover, manage or work with it?&#xA;Finally, we have disaster recovery. We are taking data integrity very seriously, and one of the things we do is to make sure that even in the case of disk failure or some other data corruption, we can still get the data out. This is done by laying out the data on disk in such a way that there are multiple ways to access it. First, by reading the data normally and assuming a valid structure. This is what we usually do. Second, by reading one byte at a time and still being able to reconstruct the data back, even if some parts of that has been corrupted. This require us to plan ahead how we store the data for a feature in advance so we can support recovery.&#xA;There are other stuff as well, anything from monitoring to debugging to performance, but usually they aren&#x2019;t so important at the design phase of a feature.</p>

It was in a place where we previous fixed a memory corruption error and was, at a glance, quite impossible.&#xA;The code would checkout an item from the cache and increment its ref count, which will keep it alive for as long as we were using it. But something made it fail, and quite horribly, too. We finally tracked the code down to this piece of code, which is run when we update the cache:&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The year 2018 just rolled by, and now it the time to talk about what we want to do in this year. The release of the 4.0 version is going to be just the start, to be honest. In no particular order, I want the following things to happen in the near future:Finishing the book (github.com/ravendb/book). I currently have more than 300 pages in it, and I&#x2019;m afraid that I&#x2019;m only 2/3 of the way, if that. RavenDB has gotten big and doing justice to everything it does take a lot of time. My wish list here is that I&#x2019;ll finish writing all the content by the first quarter and have it out (as in, you can have it on your desk) by the second quarter. Note that you can read it right now, and the feedback would be very welcome.All the client APIs RTM&#x2019;ed. We currently have clients for .NET, Python, JVM, Go, Ruby and Node.JS. Some of them are already ready for production, some are at RC level and some are still beta quality. We&#x2019;ll dedicate a some effort and release all of these in the first quarter as well. I think that alongside with being able to run on multiple operating systems, we want to give people the choice of using RavenDB from multiple platforms and having a client for a particular platform is the first step on that road.Getting (and incorporating) users&#x2019; feedback. We have worked closely with several of our customers on the release of 4.0, and we have got people chomping at the bit to just get it out (who wants to say no to being 10 &#x2013; 50 times faster). But RavenDB 4.0 is a huge undertaking, and there are going to be things that we missed. The feedback from the RC releases has been invaluable in finding scenarios and conditions that we didn&#x2019;t consider. I&#x2019;ve explicitly put aside time to handle that sort of feedback as people are rolling out RavenDB and need to smooth any rough corners that still remain. These are all the near term plans, for the next few months. These mostly deal with actually dealing with the aftermath of a big release, with nothing major planned for the near future because I expect all of us to be dealing with all the other things that you need to do with a big release. The last year had seen us grow by over 40% in terms of manpower and the flexibility of having some many great people working here which can push the product in so many directions at once is intoxicating. I have been dealing with a lot of retrospectives recently as we have been completing RavenDB 4.0 and it amazed me just how much was accomplished and how many irons we still have in the fire. So let&#x2019;s talk about the big plans for 2018, shall we?Additional storage typesIn 4.0, we have JSON documents and binary attachments that you can add to a document. One of our goals in 2018 is to add two or three additional options, turning RavenDB from a document database to a true multi paradigm database. In particular, we want to add:Distributed countersTime seriesGraph operationsThese are all going to be living together with documents, so you have have a user&#x2019;s document with a FitBit and a heartrate time series on that document that updates every 5 seconds. Or you can have a post document in a blog and use a counter to track how many likes it has gotten. And I don&#x2019;t believe that I need to explain about graph operations. We want to allow you to define connections between documents and query them directly. The idea here is that we got documents, but they aren&#x2019;t always the best tool for the job, so we want to offer you the option to do that in a way that is optimized, fast, easy and convenient to use. Better integrationWe already have done a lot of work around working with additional services and environment, we just need to polish and expose that. This means things like being able to get a PouchDB instance that is running in your browser and have it sync automatically and securely to your RavenDB cluster.&#xA0; Or being able to point RavenDB into an instance of a relational database and have it such all the data, build the document model and save your a lot of work on migrating to a document database.Ever fasterPerformance is addictive, and it has caught us. We are now orders of magnitude faster than ever before. We have actually been scaling down our production servers intentionally to be able to see if we can find more bottlenecks in the real world, so far we went down CPU by half and memory to one quarter and we are still seeing faster response times and better latencies. That said, we can do better, and we are planning to.I&#x2019;m looking forward to are things like Span&lt;T&gt; and Memory&lt;T&gt; which would really reduce overheads in some key scenarios.&#xA0; We are also eagerly awaiting the arrival of SIMD intrinsics in the CoreCLR and already have some code paths that are going to be heavily optimized as a result. Early results show something like 20% &#x2013; 40% improvement, but we&#x2019;ll probably be able to get more over time.&#xA0; One of the reasons I&#x2019;m so excited about the release is that people get to actually use the software and see how much it improved, but also give us feedback on the things that can be made even faster. Until we have actual people using us in production over a long period of time, it is hard to avoid optimizing in the dark, and that never gives a good ROI.CommunityEverything before was mostly technical things. Features that are upcoming and new things that you get to do with RavenDB. We are also going to invest heavily in getting the word out, showing up at conferences and users&#x2019; group. We are also scheduling a lot of workshops around the globe to teach RavenDB 4.0. The first round is already available here.There is also the new community license for RavenDB, allowing you to go to production without needing to purchase a commercial license. This should reduce the barrier for adoption and we hope to see a lot of new users starting to come to RavenDB. We are now free to use, running on multiple operating systems and available in the most commonly used platform. And we are easy to get right, although it was anything but easy to get there. A good example of that is the setup video.All in all, 2017 has been a major year for us, both in term of growth on any parameter we track and the culmination of years of efforts that lead us to the release of RavenDB and seeing the new version take its first steps on the first days of 2018. Happy new year, everyone.</p>
