            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">When building a system for a prison you need to consider a few more levels of high availably than usual. In particular, you might need to operate while there are riots in progress, which may be prison wide, in a single block or section or in general while in a partial failure mode. Regardless of what is going on, you want maximum survivability for the system. If there is a riot in the next block, I still want to be able to do a proper count of the inmates in this block, for example. So each block must be able to operate independently from the others.&#xA0; For that matter, the command &amp; control center must always be operational and so does the medical ward, the registration (who is in the prison right now is something that is important to know especially when there are issues. All of this means that we can&#x2019;t rely on any centralized architecture and that we want maximum separation between the different pieces. The reason this post is titled physical architecture is just that, we are talking about physical machines that reside some distance from one another. Now, granted, prisons are, by their very nature, limited in size, so we don&#x2019;t have to worry too much about the latency of calls. However, we are worried about other aspects. We have to assume low to no maintenance and the chance of riots / floods and possible locusts. The best case scenario for us is that each server will be installed on its own block, with a UPS&#xA0; if we are lucky. The whole thing residing in a locked cupboard in the block&#x2019;s sergeant&#x27;s office. Given typical conditions, the cupboard is also were the teapot and coffeemaker will reside, and we&#x2019;ll have to worry about our server going doing because someone spilled a whole pot of tea on the machine.&#xA0; But I&#x2019;ll leave completely fictional heart attack inducing events to another day and focus on the software architecture. We need to be able to operate each block independently of other blocks and from the central prison administration. That means that we will use an architecture that assumes that we are an island. All the applications that are used will only talk to a local database, and cannot assume any other connectivity being available. Instead, we&#x2019;ll build explicit data flow channels between the different parts of the system and handle that part explicitly. It is important to note that this type of architecture also has another major benefit, it cushions certain type of errors. If an inmate managed to trip on a wire and cut the network cable leading to the block, we want to still be able to operate normally for all / most usual things. This means that we can summon the network guy to come and fix things in the morning, rather than have them come up now. That is the kind of architectural results that you like if you are one of the guys who might be called in such a case.The block server will hold:The inmates that are in the block and well as their record in the block (disciplinary actions, privileges withheld / given, notes, etc).Records of counting of inmates.Log of actions happening in the block (Sargent&#x27;s diary).Tasks and operations required (sending inmates to court, scheduled work parties, cell searches, etc)That kind of data is essential for the routine operation of the block and should always be available. At the prison&#x2019;s level, you have all kind of departments and the kind of data they need to keep:Medical &#x2013; medical history and other medical stuff. This is a separate system, because there is nothing unique in a prison medical ward that require anything special other than the bars on the windows and better locks on the drug cabinets. Registration &#x2013; all the inmates in the prison as well as all their holding documents. These are the documents and authorization to withhold someone&#x2019;s freedom, and it is stored and managed by this department. This is also the department that can generate work orders (send this inmate to this court) for the rest of the prison and is the primary outside contact.Command &amp; control center &#x2013; has a view of everything and is in charge of tracking operations, but the only action it takes is to pass that information onward.I&#x2019;ll speak more about each of these departments at length in the future, but for now I want to focus on something that is very interesting. None of these departments actually need to talk to anyone else to do most of its job.The C&amp;C center needs to get reports from the blocks about counts, that inmates were sent to court, that the inmates that were supposed to be freed were actually freed, etc. But none of that has to happen through regular channels. In fact, in many cases, they&#x2019;re multiple channels that are used on an ongoing basis. In addition to having the block&#x2019;s server notify the C&amp;C systems that the counts were completed, the sergeant will also notify C&amp;C directly via a phone call about the count and how many inmates are currently in residence in the block. The prison software needs to record all of that. In fact, even though it looks like it is doing the same work twice, we need it to happen, for the same reason we have double entry book keeping. It helps catch issues and omissions.So that leads to another architectural tenant for the system. Not only are the system made of physically separated components, but we are also considering each portion of the system as a consistency boundary.I hesitated here with regards to the naming. I almost went with a security boundary, but that isn&#x2019;t quite right. It isn&#x2019;t that the other side is not trusted in the classic sense. They are trusted, but they aren&#x2019;t verified. We&#x2019;ll need to double check all such data as it goes into the system. But that leads to the next big challenge, how are we going to handle the flow of data and verification of the data across the system as a whole. I think this post is long enough as it is, so I&#x2019;ll keep that for the next one.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In prison, the notion of counting people is sacred. This is probably because the whole point of having a prison is to keep the people you put in there inside, and that means that you count inmates, multiple times a day.The dirty secret, however, is that you almost never get to that perfect occupancy number, where all the inmates that are registered to a particular block are actually in that block. In most cases, you have at least a few that are outside the block (court dates, medical issues with offsite care, visitations, outside work, etc).So the key here is not just to count the inmates, but to also account for them. Let&#x2019;s consider how this will look like in the user interface for counting a couple of cells, shall we?This works, but it isn&#x2019;t a good idea. Named counts are usually reserved for the first / last counts of the day. During the day, because it is so frequent to have inmates in and out of their assigned location, you&#x2019;ll usually do things differently. You&#x2019;ll have a total count of inmates in the block, and a list of the exceptions. That would look something like this:You have the number of inmates in the block, how many are expected to be there, the actual count as verified by the sergeant&#x2019;s signature and the named list of inmates that are not currently in the block. You might have noticed that we are carefully tracking who is responsible for any inmate that it currently out of the block. This is because that matters (for a whole host of legal and cover your ass reasons).So how would we build such a system? To start with, we need to talk about the current component or service that we are building. The notion of counting is typically done at the block level, so we&#x2019;ll start by modeling things there. We&#x2019;ll have the Block Service, which is in charge of managing anything that is going on inside the block. A block is composed of:Cells, to which inmates are assigned. This is typically an internal division only that has no real business meaning.Inmates, which are quite important.Staff, which is probably a separate issue entirely, but is quite important for thing such as having enough people at hand to do things like actually run the block. In terms of the actual operations we need to do, the block is managed by at least a single Sargent per shift and multiple guards. The Sargent is responsible for handling incoming inmates, counting all inmates multiple times a day and other things that we won&#x2019;t be tracking on a computer system. The guards will mostly interact with the system when they need to check an inmate out for whatever reason (such as taking them to a checkup by a nurse).With all of this information, we can now model the data we have for a block. Here is the most important document we have, the block&#x2019;s population. There are a few things here that are worth exploring in the design of the document:First, we have a separate document per date, recording the state of the block&#x2019;s population at that time. This is important, because we need to be able to go back in time and track such things. You can also see that the document contains a lot of data that has both the name and id. Why is that?The information recorded on this document is the data as it was at the time of this document&#x2019;s creation. Later changes do no apply, by design, since we need to see keep it at the state it was at the time.&#xA0; It might be easier to look at things in code:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

In addition to the daily&#x2019;s block population document, we also have three to five counting documents, which are built on top of it. These reflect the actual counts made plus the listing of inmates that aren&#x2019;t currently in the block and why. And that is quite enough about the prison&#x2019;s life. This give us sufficient level of details that we can now work with. The next post will talk about how the physical architecture and data flow in the prison.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been writing about the internals of RavenDB for quite a while, and it is fascinating in many respects, but it gets tiring to keep thinking about bits &amp; bytes all the time. I&#x2019;m missing writing some of the more high level stuff, in particular about software architecture. So I thought that I would take the time to resurrect a very old post series of mine, Macto. I actually have quite a few posts about this, but they are all close to a decade old, so I might as well start from scratch.&#xA;Macto is a sample app for managing a prison. This is one of the few areas in which I can be an expert on the business requirements that isn&#x2019;t utterly boring (I don&#x2019;t want to do yet another E-Commerce stuff).&#xA0; To keep up with the times, Macto is going to be written with a Micro service architecture, and just for fun, I might be doing that in multiple languages and platforms, because prison is not fun, and neither should be working on it&#x2019;s computing systems . Oh, and there is also the real world thing, I guess.&#xA;Since 2009, I have pretty much given up on building anything UI wise, so I&#x2019;m going to show a few mockup screens, but the idea is that I&#x2019;m going to be looking only at backend code, with another team actually doing the user interface.&#xA;The first thing to start with, I guess, is to paint the overall architecture of the system. Prisons are pretty rigid systems, as you might expect, but there are a lot of interconnected parts. In order to properly build a system to manage a prison we need to be able to answer what is going on from multiple points of view and from very different perspectives.&#xA;The prison commander cares about such things as the inmate&#x2019;s count (the job is to keep them all hale and accounted for). The individual guard care about the particular set of cells they are assigned to and the inmates in them. The guys at Registrations care about the legal details of having a lawful warrant for holding an inmate in prison as well as when an inmate should be released. Intelligence cares about the connections between inmates, the kind of heads up that came through channels and what kind of actions should be taken as a result. Medical needs to verify that incoming inmates are fit to be held in the facility and Transfers needs to ensure that any movements of inmates outside the prison will complete successfully (as in, you got them out, you also gotta bring them all in).&#xA;Each of those pieces interact with others in interesting and complex ways. For example, incoming inmates needs to go through Registration for legal paperwork, Medical for certification, Intelligence for verification and then assigned to the proper block.&#xA0; Once they are accepted into the prison, they are the charge of the particular block they are assigned to and rarely need to interact with the rest of the prison unless something extraordinary happens (visits, court, sickness, etc).&#xA;When thinking about the software architecture of such a system, the most important rule to remember is that we want the system to be used, this means that we really need to plan for what people are actually doing (in abstract of what they should be doing) and to help them do things, rather than hinder them. In most places, all these details are done with pen &amp; paper, and it works, so our system will have to offer something more. Not to the prison administration, but to the actual people going about their work with the inmates.&#xA;From a software architecture point of view, we are going to model the system as a set of independent services that will each have the role of one of the departments inside the prison. The current term in micro-services, but in real systems, they are not so micro, so we might need to repeatedly break things apart until we get to a level in which things make sense in isolation.&#xA;A lot of the complexity is involved in managing such a system is in the flow of information across the system. In a prison, this is the responsibility of the Command &amp; Control Center (C3, from now on) which is in charge of coordination and monitoring of actions across the board. This also work very closely with the heads of all departments and the prison commander as well as most other external parties, but it generally does nothing on its own.&#xA;I think that this is enough of an intro, and we&#x2019;ll get right on to things in the next post, where we&#x2019;ll talk about Counting Inmates.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">As part of our 4.0 deployment, we have a cluster made of mixed machines, some running Windows, some running Linux. In one particular configuration, we have 2 Windows services and a single Linux machine. We setup the cluster and started directing production traffic to it, and all was good. We left for the weekend and came back the following week, to see what the results were.&#xA0; Our Linux machine was effectively down. It was not responding to queries and it seemed like it was non responsive. That was good and bad. It was good because the rest of the cluster just worked, and there was no interruption in service. This is as designed, but it is always nice to see this in real life. It is bad because it isn&#x2019;t supposed to be happening. What was really frustrating was that we were able to log into the machine and there was nothing wrong there.No high CPU or memory, no outstanding I/O or anything of the kind that we are used to. The first clue for us was trying to diagnose the problem from inside the machine, where we able to reproduce it by trying to access the server from the local machine, resulting in the exact same issue as observed externally. Namely, the server would accept the connection and just leave it hanging, eventually timing out.That was a interesting discovery, since it meant that we can rule out anything in the middle. This is a problem in this machine. But the problem remained quite hard to figure out. We deployed to production in a manner similar to what we expect our users will do, so we used Let&#x2019;s Encrypt as the certificate authority with auto generated certificates.So we started by seeing where the problem is, whatever this is on the TCP side or the SSL side, we issued the following command:openssl s_client -connect b.cluster-name.dbs.local.ravendb.net:443This command showed immediate connection to the server and the client sending the ClientHello properly, but then just hanging there. What was really interesting is that if we waited about 2 minutes, that SSL connection would complete successfully. But we couldn&#x2019;t figure out any reason why this would be the case. It occurred to me that it might be related to the system handling of reverse DNS lookup. The two minutes timeout was very suspicious, and I assumed that it might be trying to lookup the client certificate and somehow resolve that. That isn&#x2019;t how it works in general, although the fact that some SSH (and not SSL/TLS) configuration directly relate to this has led us in a merry chase.Eventually we pulled strace and looked into what is actually going on. We focused on the following calls:sudo strace -fp 1017 -s 128 -Tfe open,socket,connect,sendto,recvfrom,writeThe interesting bits from there are shown here:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Then we have a connect() to 172.31.0.2 which is an AWS name server. Note that this is done over UDP, as you can see from the SOCK_DGRAM option in the preceding socket() call. We are getting some data back, and we can see identrust there. And then we see something really suspicious. We have a TCP socket call that goes to 192.35.177.64 on port 80. In other words, this is an HTTP call. What does an HTTP call is doing in the middle of an SSL handshake? As it turned out, our firewall configuration was blocking outbound connections to port 80. We tested removing that rule and everything came back online and the server was running just fine. Further inspection revealed that we were calling to: http://apps.identrust.com/roots/dstrootcax3.p7cAnd this is where things started to jell together. We are using Let&#x2019;s Encrypt certificates, and in order to ensure trust, we need to send the full chain to the user. SSL Certificates has the notion of Authority Information Access, which is basically a URL that is registered in the certificate that points to where you can find the certificate that signed this one. Why is this using HTTP? Because the data that will be fetched is already signed, and it is not a secret. And trying to use HTTPS to fetch it might get us into a loop. So whenever we had a new SSL connection, we&#x2019;ll try to connect to IdenTrust to get the full chain to send to the client. The killer here is that if we fail to do so, we&#x2019;ll send the certificate chain we have (without the missing root), but it will work, since the other side already have this root installed (usually). On Windows, this certificate is installed, so we didn&#x2019;t see it. On Linux, we didn&#x2019;t have that certificate installed, so we had to look it up every single time.The gory details, including dives into the source code are in the GitHub issue. And I do think they are gory. In this case, once we realized what was going on we were able to take steps to handle this. We needed to pre-register the entire chain on the local machine, so any lookup will be able to find it locally, and not do a network call per each SSL connection. But beyond mutating the global certificate store, there is no real way to prevent that remote call.Note that this is also true for Windows, although that seems to be implemented much deeper in the stack, and not in managed code, so I wasn&#x2019;t able to trace where this is actually happening. The really bad thing here is that from the outside, there is no way for us to control or disable this, so this is just something that you have to remember to do when you use certificates, make sure that the entire chain is registered on each machine, otherwise you might have a remote call per connection, or a very long (and synchronous!) hang until the request times out if you are blocking outgoing access.</p>
