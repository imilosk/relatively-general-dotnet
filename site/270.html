            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most common issues that come up with performance tuning is that dictionaries are expensive. It isn&#x2019;t so much that a single dictionary lookup is expensive, it is the sheer number of them. Dictionaries are used everywhere, and they are often used in very hot codepaths (as caching). Numerous times we have dealt with that with trying to avoid the dictionary access (often favoring an array based lookup if we can get away with it). But at some point we have decided to implement our own dictionary. Here is how it looks like:  The actual dictionary impl is very close to the standard one, but that isn&#x2019;t what make it fast. Note the generic argument? If we pass a struct implementing IEqualityComparer generic argument, then in most cases, the compiler and the JIT are going to generate code that is able to eliminate all virtual calls. And if there is a trivial equality comparison, that means that you can eliminate all calls and inline the whole thing inside that generic dictionary implementation. In other words, we eliminate a minimum of two virtual calls per key lookup, and in some cases, we can eliminate even the method calls themselves, and that turn out to be quite important when the number of key lookups is in the billions.   And this is from midway through the optimizations.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">One of the most common operations in RavenDB is to load a document, make a simple change and save it back. Usually, we tell users to just rely on the change tracking on the session and just save the document, but while it is the easiest way, it isn&#x2019;t always the best. If I have a large document, I might not want to send it all the way back to the server just for a small change. That is why RavenDB has had a Patch operation for a long time. But while we had this feature, it was always a bit clumsy. It either required you to build a patch request using a somewhat cryptic and limited object graph or to write your own inline javascript to make the modifications.  With RavenDB 4.0, we are introducing patching as a first class concept, baked directly into the session, for example: &#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below. To review, open the file in an editor that reveals hidden Unicode characters.&#xA;      Learn more about bidirectional Unicode characters&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;              Show hidden characters&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          using (var session = store.OpenSession())&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          {&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              var user = session.Load&lt;User&gt;(&quot;users/1&quot;);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              session.Advanced.Patch(user, u =&gt; u.LastLogin, DateTime.UtcNow);&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;              session.SaveChanges();&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;          &#xA;          }&#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;      &#xA;      &#xA;        view raw&#xA;        &#xA;          patching.cs&#xA;        &#xA;        hosted with &#x2764; by GitHub&#xA;      &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA; In this case, we&#x2019;ll send the server a request to update the last modified date when the SaveChanges method is called. The syntax is not all that I wish it could be, but we have to operate with the limitations that Linq syntax can accept. A more interesting case is when you want to use patching not to reduce the network load, but to allow multiple concurrent operations on the document. Let us consider the case of adding a comment to this blog post. It is fine if two users post a comment at the same time, and we can express that using: &#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

Beneath the scenes, the Linq expressions are turned into JavaScript patches, which is then used to send just the right commands for the server to work with. It&#x2019;s a really cool feature, even if I so myself.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">RavenDB it meant to be a service that just runs and runs, for very long periods of time and under pretty much all scenarios. That means that as part of our testing, we are putting a lot of emphasis on its behavior. Amount of CPU used, memory utilization, etc. And we do that in all sort of scenarios. Because getting the steady state working doesn&#x2019;t help if you have an issue, and then that issue kills you. So we put the system into a lot of weird states to see not only how it behaves, but what are the second order affects of that would be. Once such configuration was a very slow network with a very short timeout setting, so effectively we&#x2019;ll always be getting timeouts, and need to respond accordingly. We had a piece of code that is waiting for something to happen (an internal event, or a read from the network, or a timeout) and then does something accordingly.This is implemented as follows:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

If you will run this code, it will start using more and more memory. But why? On the face of it, this looks like a perfectly reasonable code. What is actually happening is that the WaitAny will call CommonCWAnyLogic, which will call an AddCompletionAction on that task, which will track it, so we have a list of items there. So if we have a lot of waits on the same task, that is going to cause us to track all of those waits. Here is what it looks like after a short while in the debugger.   And there is our memory leak. The solution, by the way, was to not call WaitAny each time, but to call WhenAny, and then call Wait() on the resulting task, and keep that task around until it is completed, so we only register to the original event once.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Every time that I think about this feature, I am reminded of this song. This is a feature that is only ever going to be used in everything fails. In fact, it isn&#x2019;t a feature, it is an early warning system, whose sole purpose is to tell you when you are screwed.&#xA;Checksums in RavenDB (actually, Voron, but for the purpose of discussion, there isn&#x2019;t much difference) are meant to detect when the hardware has done something bad. We told it to save a particular set of data, and it didn&#x2019;t do it properly, even though it had been very eager to tell us that this can never happen.&#xA;The concept of a checksum is pretty simple, whenever we write a page to disk, we&#x2019;ll hash it, and store the hash in the page. When we read the page from disk, we&#x2019;ll check if the hash matches the actual data that we read. If not, there is a serious error. It is important to note that this isn&#x2019;t actually related to the way we are recovering from failures and midway through transactions.&#xA;That is handled by the journal, and the journal is also protected by a checksum, on a per transaction basis. However, handling this sort of errors is both expected and well handled. We know where the data is likely to fail and we know why, and we have the information required (in the journal) to recover from it.&#xA;This is different, this is validating that data that we have successfully written to disk, and flushed successfully, is actually still resident in the form that we are familiar with. This can happen because the hardware outright lied to us (can usually happen with cheap hardware) or there is some failure (cosmic rays are just one of the many options that you can run into). In particular if running on crappy hardware, this can be just because overheating or too much load on the system. As a hint, another name for crappy hardware is a cloud machine.&#xA;There are all sorts of ways that you can happen, and the literature makes for a very sad reading. In a CERN study, about 900 TB were written in the course of six months, and about 180 MB resulted in errors.&#xA;The following images are from a NetApp study shows that over a time period of 2.5 years, 8.5% of disks had silent data corruption errors. You can assume that those are not cheap off the shelves disks. Some of the causes are great reading if you are a fan of mysteries and puzzles, but kind of depressing if you build databases for a living (or rely on databases in general).&#xA;&#xA;Those are just the failures that had interesting images, mind, there are a lot more there. But from the point of view of the poor database, it ends up being the same thing. The hardware lied to me. And there is very little that a database can do to protect itself against such errors.&#xA;Actually, that is a lie. There is a lot that a database can do to protect itself. It used to be common to store critical pages in multiple locations on disks (usually making sure that they are physically far away from one another), as a way to reduce the impact of the inevitable data corruption. This way, things like the pages that describe where all the rest of the data in the system reside tend to be safe from most common errors, and you can at least recover a bit.&#xA;As you probably guessed, Voron does checksums, but it doesn&#x2019;t bother to duplicate information. That is already something that is handled by RavenDB itself. Most of the storage systems that are dealing with data duplication (ZFS has this notion with the copies command, for example) were typically designed to work primarily on a single primary node (such as file system that don&#x2019;t have distribution capabilities). Given that RavenDB replication already does this kind of work for us, there is no point duplicating such work at the storage layer. Instead the checksum feature is meant to detect a data corruption error and abort any future work on suspect data.&#xA;In a typical cluster, this will generate an error on access, and the node can be taken down and repaired from a replica. This serves as both an early warning system and as a way to make sure that a single data corruption in one location doesn&#x2019;t &#x201C;infect&#x201D; other locations in the database, or worse, across the network.&#xA;So now that I have written oh so much about what this feature is, let us talk a bit about what it is actually doing. Typically, a database would validate the checksum whenever it reads the data from disk, and then trust the data in memory ( is isn&#x2019;t really safe to do that either, but let&#x2019;s us not pull the&#xA0; research on that, otherwise you&#x2019;ll be reading the next post on papyrus) as long as it resides in its buffer pool.&#xA;This is simple, easy and reduce the number of validation you need to do. But Voron doesn&#x2019;t work in this manner. Instead, Voron is mapping the entire file into memory, and accessing it directly. We don&#x2019;t have a concept of reading from disk, or a buffer pool to manage. Instead of doing the OS work, we assume that it can do what it is supposed to do and concentrate on other things. But it does mean that we don&#x2019;t control when the data is loaded from disk. Technically speaking, we could have tried to hook into the page fault mechanism and do the checks there, but that is so far outside my comfort zone that it gives me the shivers. &#x201C;Wanna run my database? Sure, just install this rootkit and we can now operate properly.&#x201D;&#xA;I&#x2019;m sure that this would be a database administrator&#x2019;s dream. I mean, sure, I can package that in a container, and then nobody would probably mind, but&#x2026; the insanity has to stop somewhere.&#xA;Another option would be to validate the checksum on every read, that is possible, and quite easy, but this is going to incur a substantial performance penalty to do ensure that something that shouldn&#x2019;t happen didn&#x2019;t happen. Doesn&#x2019;t seem like a good tradeoff to me.&#xA;What we do instead is make the best of it. We keep a bitmap of all the pages in the data file, and we&#x2019;ll validate them the first time that we access them (there is a bit of complexity here regarding concurrent access, but we are racing it to success and at worst we&#x2019;ll end up validating the page multiple times), and afterward, we know that we don&#x2019;t need to do that again. Once we loaded the data to memory even once, we assume that is isn&#x2019;t going to change beneath our feet by something. This isn&#x2019;t an axiom, and there are situations where a page can be loaded from disk, valid, and then become corrupted on disk. The OS will discard it at some point, and then read the corrupt data again, but this is a much rarer circumstance than before.&#xA;The fact that we recently have verified that the the page is valid is a good indication that it will remain valid, and anything else have too much overhead for us to be able to use (and remember that we also have those replicas for those extreme rare cases).&#xA0;&#xA;Independent of this post, I just found this article which injected errors in multiple databases data and examined how they behaved. Facincating reading.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">This piece of code is part of a test that runs a scenario, and checks that the appropriate errors are logged. Very occasionally, this test would fail, and it would be nearly impossible to figure out why.  I&#x2019;ve extracted the offending code from the test, ReadFromWebSocket returns a Task&lt;string&gt;, since that isn&#x2019;t obvious from the code. Do you see the error?  Think about it, what is this doing?  This is reading from a socket, and there is absolutely no guarantee about the amount of data that will go over the wire in any particular point. Because this test assumes that the entire string will be read in a single call from the socket, if the expected value we are looking is actually going to be returned in two calls, we&#x2019;ll miss it, and this will never return, leading to sadness and worry everywhere*. * At least everywhere that care about our tests. The fix was to remember the previous values and compare to all the data read from the socket, not just the values that were returned in the last call.</p>
