            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have posted in the past about NHibernate&#x27;s cascade being one of the places that require careful attention. But I run into an issue with it yesterday.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;The issue was that we had a typical parent-children scenario, but the requirement changed and we had to support orphans. That is, children without a parent. This isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, after all, and I told Imperial to just change the cascade from all-delete-orphan to all, and forgot about it.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;I was called a few minutes afterward, and saw that the change didn&#x27;t have the desired effect. The scenario that we were working on was deleting the parent, where the child needed to remain behind (will null foreign key, of course). Now, I was being stupid, and I started debugging into NHibernate to figure out what was the cause of this &quot;bug&quot;. Ten minutes later (took a while to find where exactly this was happening), I had an &quot;Oh, I am so dumb&quot; moment.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;So, to save myself from future embarrassment, let me try to articulate what it means:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;NHibernate Cascades:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Entities has associations to other objects, this may be an association to a single item (many-to-one) or an association to a collection (one-to-many, many-to-any).&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;At any rate, you are able to tell NHibernate to automatically traverse an entity&#x27;s associations, and act according to the cascade option. For instance, adding an unsaved entity to a collection with save-update cascade will cause it to be saved along with its parent object, without any need for explicit instructions on our side.&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Here is what each cascade option means:&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;none - do not do any cascades, let the users handles them by themselves.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;save-update - when the object is saved/updated, check the associations and save/update any object that require it (including save/update the associations in many-to-many scenario).&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;delete - when the object is deleted, delete all the objects in the association.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;delete-orphan - when the object is deleted, delete all the objects in the association. In addition to that, when an object is removed from the association and not associated with another object (orphaned), also delete it.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;all - when an object is save/update/delete, check the associations and save/update/delete all the objects found.&#xA;&#x9;&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;all-delete-orphan - when an object is save/update/delete, check the associations and save/update/delete all the objects found. In additional to that, when an object is removed from the association and not associated with another object (orphaned), also delete it.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#x9;Fairly simple, isn&#x27;t it? I have no idea why I managed to forget this. At any rate, my issue was that I set the cascade to all, and then deleted to root object, which naturally deleted all the child objects. Setting it to save-update was what I wanted to do, once I did that, everything went just fine.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">If you ever had to work with someone else&#x27;s database (I assume that yours are perfect), you know that not all databases are nice and clean. In fact, some of them fail to do even simple things, like foreign keys. In some cases, FK is not even possible (think a view over a main frame table that you don&#x27;t control).    In such cases, almost invariablely, the database slightly corrupts itself. Sometimes it is a programmer error, sometime a failed set of commands without transactions, etc. The end result is that you get an id to another table, but no row that match this id. To say that it is hard to deal with this kind of scenario is an understatement. Even if we are dealing with a nullable FK (which is not always the case), if it has a value, but no matching record, this is a big issue.    Most often, this lead to an attempt to &quot;clean up the data&quot;, but this usually lead to finding even more issues, and in many cases there is a big fear that this will damage business critical data. The developers are then left to fend themselves against the unruly database (and the damaged relational model is weaping at the corner).    In NHibernate 1.2, a new attribute was introduced to help solve this issue, this is not-found=&quot;ignore&quot;, which instruct NHibernate to treat non existing FK not as errors (as is the default), but as nulls. Here is a simple example:            &lt;many-to-one name=&quot;Parent&quot; column=&quot;ParentId&quot;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;lazy=&quot;proxy&quot; not-found=&quot;ignore&quot;                        &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0;class=&quot;Item&quot;/&gt;        The nice thing about this feature is that if you save this object into the database, NHibernate will update the column to NULL, helping to restore the database to a sane state.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Dennis is talking about the shutdown button issue, and bring some new insight&#xA0;into it:Is that really all that surprizing [lots of people with a say on this feature]? We are, of course,&#xA0;talking about a critical UI element of the flagship of a $300 billion dollar company. In particular about one of the most communicated and referenced features of an operating system that will see installation on hundreds of millions (possibly over a billion) PCs.    Is it really that surprizing that a lot of people have a say in this critical feature? Maybe not. I agree that this is a highly visible feature, and that it has ties to all sort of surpising places (the kernel for one, the messaging system to inform other applications - including the hot boot support, etc).    The problem that most of us have with this is not the complexity of the ties to this feature, I think that if someone sat down and thought about all the places that this feature would touch, they would be amazed. I spend half a minute on this and I can think of a lot of issues, and I have little interest in Windows Internals.    The problem is that someone spent a year actively working on the menu. And the way it was managed. A quick calculation shows that 3.5 man-months were wasted just in meetings about this feature. 3.5 months.&#xA0;    There is also the huge hassle in getting your dependencies through all the the gate keepers along the way. Let me give you a simple scenario, two teams need a feature from a third team, which is on another branch. Team A discover that it needs a certain feature, and ask team C to implement it. Team C does this, and goes their own merry way. Two months later, Team A gets the change, and they start working on that. Team B, a month later, discovers that there is a bug in their code because of this feature, and request a fix. Two months later, Team C&#x27;s fix reach them, but four months afterward, Team A disocver that this fix broke their code. Rinse, repeat, weap.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Check this&#xA0;out. This is a short explanation on how Microsoft manages to produce Windows.     After reading this;            four to six months to get the dependencies that you need for a feature?!                 the same length of time until other people get to use your code and you hear some feedback?!            64 people who has a say in the freaking Off menu?!            a year to develop a menu with seven options?!    I literally can&#x27;t grasp how they manages to do anything done. This puts Big Bang integration to shame, it is a Continious Big Bang, but six months too late.&#xA0;Some of the immediate implications is that until very late into the product, there is no authorotive source for Windows. No wonder they had to do a recylce two years ago, they were trying to do that and build WinFX on top of the (moving) .net 2.0 / 3.0. Exactly how many pieces do they think that they can juggle at one time?    And why on earth are there 64 people with a say on single feature? A feature should have at most two owners, the business-side owner and the tech owner (usually the tech lead / developer), everyone else is a dependency either you on them or they on you. They don&#x27;t get to make decisions.&#xA0;At one time when I was in the army I had 9 people who were my direct commands, and at one point i literally had 28 ocnflicting orders. I went home and let them deal with it (a very good way to deal with annoying people, by the way).    There are few (if any) software projects on the level of Windows, but I don&#x27;t think that it is possible to develop software in this manner. There are all too many people in the way for it to work. Also, this information made Microsoft a lot less attractive place to work with. I don&#x27;t like being in a no-code/all-meeting days, and there are very few things that annoys me more then people telling me things that they already did.    No wonder that they are bleeding the good people out. They are going to find places they can actually work for.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, I have installed vista, wasn&#x27;t very happy about it, and went back to XP. This raise the question, what is the killer application for Vista? Even in my brief use of Vista, I could see a lot of stuff that I liked. But none of them was really good in the level of &quot;Oh, I must have this!&quot;    Just repaving a system is something that take me days/weeks to recover from. Moving from XP/2003 to Vista is something that is going to take even longer. There should be something that would make me (and other users) want to move. For Windows 3.0, that was Excel / Word. For Windows XP, it was a very long process of just getting it out of the box (I can&#x27;t recall any reason to upgrade from 2000, and indeed, I didn&#x27;t for a long time).    According to several people who already jumped on the Vista wagon, the impvorements to the OS are many incrememntal ones, and not several big ones. This is a Good Thing, except that it takes a long while to get used to those improvement, and get annoyed when they are not there.    Is there a killer application for Vista?</p>

Attempting to install VPN client (checkpoint, for what it worth) caused a blue screen and resulted in an un-operational system.

Just about every action that I made at the start of the system cause a security dialog. This security dialog is accompanied with a screen flicker, which looks excatly like the start of a blue screen. I imagine that after stabalizing the system, I won&#x27;t have to run into those so often, but it is still highly annoying.            IE7 is Not FireFox - It looks a lot alike, but it behaves differently, very annoying.

There are a lot of UI features that I say &quot;Wow, this is nice&quot;, and some that I have already to say &quot;Wow, this is useful&quot;.            Visual Studio / Sql Server / MSDN - Refused to install.            Couldn&#x27;t get the screen (LG L1800P) to portrait mode.                 I spent most of the day reading Agile Development With Rails, since Rails does work on Vista.            I kept waiting for it to crush, since application did so with regular consistency. I never did actually install anything on it, just some Portable Applications, and that was it.    I am writing this on my &quot;old&quot; XP mahcine, where I can use VPN, use the screen in portrait mode and actually do some useful work.    I might try it again when there would be a consumer release, and all the drivers/applications would be more mature (or even exist). But for now, I don&#x27;t see the benefit.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">That took quite a while. At first I got the 0x80070241 error midway through install, which seems to only happen on upgrades. I finally just installed from scratch, which is very annoying, but at least worked.&#xA;As a matter of fact, I installed twice. The first time I tried to install CheckPoint SecureClient, and all hell broke lose. Blue screens all over the place, it got to the point that I couldn&#x27;t even boot. I finally decided to scrap that install and install again from scrtach.&#xA;The annoying security dialogs are indeed annoying, what is more, the second before they appear, the entire screen blinks, I assume that this is because of the new desktop being created. the problem with that is that it looks excatly like it is going to blue screeen.&#xA;So far, I can&#x27;t say that I am particularily impressed with anything there. The enw webby Look &amp; Feel drives me nuts because I don&#x27;t know if I need to double click or single click, for instnace.&#xA;It is prettier, I will give it that. &#xA;The problem is that until I get the VPN issue straighten out I literally can&#x27;t do anything with the computer. No Visual Studio, no Office, nothing.&#xA;In the meantime, I think that I will purp</p>
