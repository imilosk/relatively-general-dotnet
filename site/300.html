            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So we are using a particular library in a not so standard way. And in order to gain 10x performance benefit we have to reuse a particular class from this library. This class isn&#x2019;t meant to be reused, but looking at its code, it is clear that it is perfectly possible to do so. All we need is to set the _started field to false and it will be possible to reuse this instance. So far, so good. Except that the field is private. Now, we can&#x2019;t just implement our own copy of this, because this is a field in the base class that we are extending to plug our extension to the system. We could try submitting a patch for this, but this is a popular library, and tying ourselves to a particular version would suck. This code has also hasn&#x2019;t changed since at Jan 2012, so that is pretty stable. And yes, we are aware of the risk in doing this, unsupported, etc.  Now that we decided to do it, the question is how. I created the following epic class:  And here is the simplest option to handle it:  And that gives us:  Can we do better? What happens if we cache the field lookup?  This has significant improvement, right?  But that is still quite high for me. Can we do better still? Let us try some dynamic code generation. In this case, we can&#x2019;t use the much easier Expression class to do it, and have to go with direct IL generation, which gives:  And the benchmark result?  That is pretty awesome. For comparison purposes, I also did a static delegate and direct set, to compare the costs.  And those give me:  But I think that 2.5 ns is fast enough for me here .</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Here is an interesting problem. If you want to load test a server, it is very hard to truly to do so. Put simply, after a while, the problem isn&#x2019;t with your code, it is with the ability of the surrounding systems to actually get the requests to you fast enough.  In this case, let us talk about what is going on when you are actually doing an HTTP request.  We&#x2019;ll start from the following code:    Seems pretty simple, right? And all we need to do is to actually send enough of those and we&#x2019;ll be able to put enough load on the server to matter, right? Except that it doesn&#x2019;t quite works like this. Let us see what the code above is actually doing by stripping away the HTTP later and dropping down to TCP, shall we?    &#xA0; And that looks good, right? Except that it is still hiding some details. I&#x2019;m too lazy to go down to raw sockets and demonstrate the details, and anyway it would be way too much code to show here.  Here is a diagram that demonstrate what is going over the network for the two code sample above:  &#x2B;---------&#x2B;                      &#x2B;---------&#x2B;&#xA;| Client  |                      | Server  |&#xA;&#x2B;---------&#x2B;                      &#x2B;---------&#x2B;&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | [SYN]                          |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |                      [SYN-ACK] |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | [SYN]                          |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                | -----------------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| Connection now established |&#xA;     |                                | |----------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | [GET / HTTP 1.1]               |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                | -------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| The HTTP request |&#xA;     |                                | |------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |      [HTTP/1.1 302 Found ... ] |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                | --------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| The HTTP response |&#xA;     |                                | |-------------------|&#xA;     |                                | -----------------------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| Client now will close connection |&#xA;     |                                | |----------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | FIN                            |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |                            ACK |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |                            FIN |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | ACK                            |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;Note that this is for the simplest case, assuming that the response is just one packet, assume no packet drops, and ignore stuff like HTTPS, which adds another 4 packets to the initialization, and we are also accounting for the last 4 packets that are required to properly close a connection. This is important, because if you are trying to do high load benchmark, creating and not properly closing TCP connections means that you&#x2019;ll soon run out of available ports (all your connections will be in CLOSE_WAIT or TIME_WAIT state).&#xA;Now, the problem is that this is really expensive. As in, wow expensive. So pretty much as soon as the web started to hit it off (mid 90s or so), people realized that this isn&#x2019;t going to work, and the notion of Keep-Alive was born.&#xA;With Keep-Alive, you are going to reuse the same TCP connection to send multiple requests to the server. The idea is that once the connection is open, there is a strong likelihood that you&#x2019;ll use it again soon, so why pay the 7 packets cost for opening &amp; closing the TCP connection?&#xA;With that optimization, we then have:&#xA;&#x2B;---------&#x2B;                      &#x2B;---------&#x2B;&#xA;| Client  |                      | Server  |&#xA;&#x2B;---------&#x2B;                      &#x2B;---------&#x2B;&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | [SYN]                          |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |                      [SYN-ACK] |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | [SYN]                          |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                | -----------------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| Connection now established |&#xA;     |                                | |----------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | [GET / HTTP 1.1]               |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                | -------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| The HTTP request |&#xA;     |                                | |------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |      [HTTP/1.1 302 Found ... ] |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                | --------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| The HTTP response |&#xA;     |                                | |-------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | [GET /index HTTP 1.1]          |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                | -------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| 2nd HTTP request |&#xA;     |                                | |------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |           [HTTP/1.1 200  ... ] |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                | --------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| 2nd HTTP response |&#xA;     |                                | |-------------------|&#xA;     |                                | -----------------------------------\&#xA;     |                                |-| Client now will close connection |&#xA;     |                                | |----------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | FIN                            |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |                            ACK |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     |                            FIN |&#xA;     |&lt;-------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;     | ACK                            |&#xA;     |-------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                |&#xA;And the more requests we make to the server, the better we are. Now, there is another trick that we can apply here. Remember that TCP is stream oriented, not packet oriented. That means that as far as the calling code is concerned, we aren&#x2019;t actually seeing packets, just bytes arriving one after another.&#xA;So we can change the way things work to this:&#xA;&#x2B;---------&#x2B;                                                     &#x2B;---------&#x2B;&#xA;| Client  |                                                     | Server  |&#xA;&#x2B;---------&#x2B;                                                     &#x2B;---------&#x2B;&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     | [SYN]                                                         |&#xA;     |--------------------------------------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     |                                                     [SYN-ACK] |&#xA;     |&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     | [SYN]                                                         |&#xA;     |--------------------------------------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                                               | -----------------------------\&#xA;     |                                                               |-| Connection now established |&#xA;     |                                                               | |----------------------------|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     | [GET / HTTP 1.1, GET /data HTTP 1.1, GET /fast HTTP 1.1]      |&#xA;     |--------------------------------------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                                               | -------------------------------------\&#xA;     |                                                               |-| 3 HTTP requests in a single apcket |&#xA;     |                                                               | |------------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     |              [HTTP/1.1 302 Found ..., HTTP/1.1 200, HTTP 403] |&#xA;     |&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                                               | ----------------------------------\&#xA;     |                                                               |-| All HTTP response in one packet |&#xA;     |                                                               | |---------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                                               | -----------------------------------\&#xA;     |                                                               |-| Client now will close connection |&#xA;     |                                                               | |----------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     | FIN                                                           |&#xA;     |--------------------------------------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     |                                                           ACK |&#xA;     |&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     |                                                           FIN |&#xA;     |&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;     | ACK                                                           |&#xA;     |--------------------------------------------------------------&gt;|&#xA;     |                                                               |&#xA;What we did is pretty simple. Instead of waiting for the server to respond to the request, and only then reuse the connection to send the next one, we can send the requests immediately one after the other, without waiting. &#xA;In some cases, we can even package multiple requests into a single TCP packet. And the server (shouldn&#x2019;t) care about that. &#xA;Here is what this looks like in practice:&#xA;&#xA;Now, na&#xEF;ve server code will fail here, because it will read from the socket into a buffer, (including some part of the next request), and then forget about that.&#xA0; But it isn&#x2019;t hard to make sure that this work properly, and that is the key for all high performance servers.&#xA;Basically, the real problem is driving enough packets into the server to generate load. By pipelining requests like that, we reduce the number of packets we need to send while at the same time getting a lot higher load.&#xA;The cost of routing a packet is independent of its size, and while the size you send is important for bandwidth, the packet latency is much more important for actual speed (latency vs. bandwidth, again). So if we can pack the data into fewer packets, this is a net win. In other words, this is HTTP doing car pooling.&#xA;&#xA0;&#xA;&#xA;And now that you can drive enough requests into your server to actually stress it, you can work your way into actually handling this load.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I mentioned in passing that a lot of the actual memory use we have in RavenDB 4.0 is in unmanaged code. That frees us from the benevolent tyranny of the garbage collector, and it allow us to optimize our memory utilization to fit our usage scenarios. In particular, most of our memory is used in thread local manner, and there it is used in one of two ways. Dedicated threads that do specific type of work (indexing, replication, etc) and request processing threads, that handle all requests.  A typical scenario for us would be to have a lot of requests come in all of a sudden and require us to allocate all bunch of memory, for example, if we have just run a benchmark. Or, for production usage, a spike in traffic that then turns into a lull.  One of the common hotspots in high performance servers is memory allocations, in particular, allocating and de-allocating can kill your performance. So you don&#x2019;t do that. Instead, you pool the memory and reuse it,hopefully without major costs for doing that. Which is all well and good, until you get that spike. In this case, you allocated memory to handle the traffic, and after the load is over, you are still holding on to that memory, and we probably really should give it back so something else can use that. Sure, it will be paged out to disk eventually, etc, and virtual memory is there to cover us, but that is really not the right way to write high performance stuff.  Now, the way we want to handle it, we want to wait until everything is calmed, and then start de-allocating all that memory that isn&#x2019;t being used. But that lead to a problem. How can we do this if everything is thread local? And you want to have everything thread local, because synchronization on memory allocation/de-allocation is one of the most common performance killers.  So we handle this by using a MutliReaderSingleWriterStack. The idea is, like in the previous post,&#xA0; we have a designated data structure that has only a single write and is held in a thread local value, but that is expected to be read by multiple threads. In particular, the thread that is going to be reading from it is the idle thread. Once a minute, this is going to scan all the threads, find all the saved memory that we have allocated but haven&#x2019;t used in the past minute, and clear it. Because this can run concurrently with the thread using memory itself, we&#x2019;ll only free the memory that is parked (as in, waiting for work to come), not memory that is actively used. And we also need to be aware that we aren&#x2019;t taking the idle memory to be disposed at the same time the thread is reaching for its memory bank to pull a new range. Here we have to have some thread safe operation. We do that using an interlocked operation on the InUse field. Both the cleanup thread and the owning thread will try to set that value, but only one of them will succeed.  In this way, under load, we get to use purely local memory, but we also have automatic cleanup going on if we have an idle period.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Finding the appropriate image for this post was hard, you try searching for &#x201C;racy pictures&#x201D; in Google Image Search, but you might not want to do it from work . Anyway, today at lunch we had a discussion about abstractions and at what level you should be working. The talk centered about the difference between working in low level C and working with a high level framework like C# and the relative productivity associated with it. At one point the following argument was raised: &#x201C;Well, consider the fact that you never need to implement List, for example&#x201D;. To which my reaction was: &#x201C;I did just that last week&#x201D;. Now, to forestall the nitpickers, pretty much any C developer will have an existing library of common data structures already in place, I know. And no, you shouldn&#x2019;t be implementing basic data structures unless you have a really good reason. In my case, I think I did. The issue is very simple. I need to have a collection of items that are safe for multi threaded reads, but they are mostly only ever accessed from a single thread, and are only ever modified by a single thread. Oh, and they are also extremely performance sensitive. The reason we started looking into replacing them is that the concurrent data structures that we were using (ConcurrentDictionary &amp; ConcurrentStack, in those cases) were too expensive. And a large part of that was because they gave us a lot more than what we actually needed (fully concurrent access). So, how do we build a simple list that allow for the following:  Only one thread can write. Multiple threads can read. No synchronization on either end. Stale reads allowed. The key part here is the fact that we allow stale reads.  Here is the concrete scenario, we need to track all active transactions. A transaction is single threaded, but we allow thread hopping (because of async). So we define:  And then we have:  DynamicArray is just a holder for an array of Nodes. Whenever we need to add an item to the active transactions, we&#x2019;ll get the local thread value, and do a linear search through the array. If we find a node that has a null Transaction value, we&#x2019;ll use it. Otherwise, we&#x2019;ll add a new Node value to the end of the array. If we run out of room in the array, we&#x2019;ll double the array size.&#xA0; All pretty standard stuff, so far. Removing a value from the array is also simple, all you need to do is to null the Transaction field on the relevant node.  Why all of this? Well, only a single thread can ever register a transaction for a particular DynamicArray instance. That means that we don&#x2019;t have to worry about concurrency here. However, we do need to worry about transactions that need to remove themselves from the list from other threads. That is why we don&#x2019;t have any concurrency control here. Instead, removing the transaction is done by setting the node&#x2019;s Transaction field to null. Since only the owning transaction can do that, this is safe. Other threads, however, need to read this information. They do that by scanning through all the thread values, and then accessing the DynamicArray directly. Now, that means that we need to be safe for concurrent reading. This is done by having the array more or less static on most scenarios. After it get full enough, it will never grow again, and the values will remain there, so effectively other threads will be reading an array of Nodes. We do need to be careful when we expand the array to give more room. We do this by first creating the new array, copying the values to the new array, and only then setting it in the threaded instance.  This way, concurrent code may either see the old array or the new one, but never need to traverse both. And when traversing, it goes through the nodes and check their Transaction value.  Remember that the Transaction is only being set from the original thread, but can be reset from another thread if the transaction moved between threads. We don&#x2019;t really care, the way it works, we read the node&#x2019;s transaction field, and then check its value (once we have a stable reference). The idea is that we don&#x2019;t worry about data races. The worst that can happen is that we&#x2019;ll see an older view of the data, which is perfectly fine for our purposes.  This is pretty complex, but the code itself is simple enough, and the performance benefit justify it several times over.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Some of the performance work that I have been doing recently was complex, and then, some of it isn&#x2019;t:  And its implementation:  And the optimized version:  And the result?  The really interesting thing is that we have an improvement that is about 3 times more than we would expect. Why is that? We can see that we eliminated the ResouceName call, and saved all of that cost, but we have much lower cost overall, where did that come from? This is something that we saw over and over again. The obvious answer is that we now do less allocations, so we have less GC work to do, which is true as far as it goes, but it is also true that when we are even slightly faster, things start to align more closely, and we get a chain reaction (slightly less work means more time process the actual requests, so we can get more done in less).</p>
