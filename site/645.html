            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In normal systems, when we want to understand what is going on, or to investigate a problem, we have a really simple option, just debug it until you have found the root cause. This is so common that we actually have best practices against being too dependent on the debugger.&#xA;I think that we can all agree that the industry is going more and more toward parallelism. And distributed applications are more and more common. This present an interesting problem for us when we come to understand &amp; troubleshoot a system. It is no longer possible to simply step through the code as it is executing and thus gain the knowledge that we need in order to understand exactly what is going on.&#xA;In order to understand these kind of systems, we need to develop new tools and approaches. Microsoft already did some of that when they built web services for .Net. It is literally possible to debug through a web service call and move from the client to the server (assuming that they are on the same machine) just by pressing F11.&#xA;This doesn&#x27;t really work for most scenarios, however, a common example is a system that is distributed in both time and space (imagine an authorization process that can take minutes or hours). Or a system where the stream of messages is simply too high to be able to individually understand.&#xA;In order to deal with this type of systems, we need to go a long way back. Sometimes before we had debuggers, we still needed a way to figure out what is going on, and we found it.&#xA;Welcome to printf() debugging (or Response.Write debugging, if you prefer it this way).&#xA;And no, we are not quite in the same position, but we are close. One of the main problems here is the fact that we need to coordinate several different machines and correlate between work done on different times and with different capacity.&#xA;WCF calls this end to end logging, and achieve this by attaching a guid that you have to carry around, plus some tools that allow you to merge different logging files to give a unified view across systems.&#xA;BizTalk has the notion of Business Activity Monitoring, and other tools share the same concept. All of them are based on the notion of a common id that spans multiple messages and can be used across machines to get a single view of the entire set of actions.&#xA;In a world that is fast become more and more distributed, such tools are quickly becoming essentials, and I foresee quite a few best practices that will be aimed solely at ensuring that we keep that single thread of traceability in place.&#xA;I find it quite amusing that we are basically going back to reading log files to figure out what is going on with our applications. Of course, there are logs and there are logs, and I&#x27;ll talk about logging &amp; auditing in a lot more detail in a future post.&#xA;&#xA;Messaging</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">While renting a car, I was presented with the option to pay for the tank refill up front (with something like 20% off the standard price at most gas stations). On the face of it, it looked like a really sweat deal, but a little bit of thinking has shown that the only way that I come out ahead in this scenario is if I return the car with the fuel car empty. In any other scenario, I paid for a full tank, but the company doesn&#x27;t have to fill the whole tank. Case in point, by the time that I got to the return point, I had half a tank full of gas. That would make the prepaid tank option result in me paying almost 200% over the standard price just for gas. I hate cheaters!&#xA;While checking in to my flight to NJ, I was required to pay additional 40$ for &quot;excess baggage&quot;. That is the first time I run into this, and I was extremely annoyed. This is not excess baggage, that is just my standard suitcases. Moreover, as a result of this decision, people have started to take a lot more stuff with them in the plain, since that is free. The result is that the storage bins above the seats are completely full, and we were instructed by the flight attendants to put as much of the baggage as possible under the seats. I have enough problems with leg room in flights anyway, and this didn&#x27;t help at all. Couldn&#x27;t the airline carriers see the direct correlations between the two? And how much this would reduce the quality of flying?&#xA;Another cheating case. I was at Dave &amp; Buster (air hooky rocks) and we bought some play time. The problem is that while you can buy points at increments of 10, the actual machines are never charging you full numbers, it is always things like 5.6, or 9.8. The direct result is that your card is never really full. This is an incentive to go and fill it, or return to D&amp;B at a later date, to &quot;finish up the card&quot;. Moreover, there is no easy correlation between the points that the games charge you and the dollar amount that you paid.&#xA;Finally, and the most annoying at the moment. In my hotel there is direct reverse correlation between the quality of the room and the level of internet reception that exists there. In other words, if I get a good room, I get bad reception, and vice versa. Oh, and they &quot;can do nothing about that&quot;. Argh!&#xA;And this is a note to businesses in general, if I find out that you try to cheat people who can&#x27;t do grade school math, I am going to treat you in the same manner that I treat people who kick puppies.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">During KaizenConf, we discussed the notion of messaging as a first level concept quite a bit. I have already spoken about this at length, but I think that there is still a lot of room to talk about actual implementation and architecture details.&#xA;The example that was chosen as the reference implementation for Mass Transit reference implementation was Starbucks. This is a concept that should be familiar to most programmers, while at the same time offering us a good way of exploring quite a few messaging concepts.&#xA;The scenario in the example is simple, I want to order a venti hot chocolate. Let us explore how this is done:&#xA;&#xA;  I (client) ask the cashier (external facing service) for a venti hot chocolate.&#xA;&#xA;  The cashier informs the barista (internal service) that a new order for venti hot chocolate has arrived.&#xA;&#xA;  The barista starts preparing the drink.&#xA;&#xA;  The cashier starts the payment process (credit card auth, or just counting change).&#xA;&#xA;  When the cashier finishes the payment process, he tells the barista that the payment process is done.&#xA;&#xA;  I (client) move to the outgoing coffee stand, and wait for my coffee.&#xA;&#xA;  The barista finishes preparing the drink, check that the payment for this order was done, and serve the drink.&#xA;&#xA;  I pick up my drink, and the whole thing is finished.&#xA;&#xA;As you can see, there are a lot of steps invovles in the process, and that is just the plain all success story. We have cases in which the cashier finish the payment process before the the barista starts, cases where I forget to pick up the drink, cases where the authorization fails after the drink is done, etc.&#xA;All of those scenarios represent a really good background for discussing messaging scenarios, patterns and applications. This will also be the default topic that I&#x27;ll use for messaging scenarios (much the same way that the blog &amp; payroll are my default examples for data and behaviors).</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I have been thinking about this for a while now. Linq to NHibernate requires two to three months of full time development work in order to get to a really good usable state. The problem is that we don&#x27;t have anyone working on that full time. Considering the nature of OSS, this is not surprising, but I would like to change that if I can.&#xA;I am trying to getting sponsorship from several companies that are willing to pay for the development of Linq for NHibernate. The details are very simple, if I get enough companies interested in this to dedicate enough time &amp; resources into it, we can get it working.&#xA;If you or your company are interested in helping fund the Linq for NHibernate project, please contact me privately, and we can discuss how we go about this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In a typical management speak post, the ADO.Net team has killed the Linq to SQL project. I think this is a mistake from Microsoft part. Regardless of how this affects NHibernate (more users to us, yeah!), I think that this is a big mistake&#xA;Doing something like this is spitting in the face of everyone who investment time and money in the Linq to SQL framework, only to be left hanging in the wind, with a dead end software and a costly porting process if they ever want to see new features. Linq to SQL is a decent base level OR/M, and I had had several people tell me that they are willing to accept its current deficiencies, knowing that this will be fixed in the next version. Now, there isn&#x27;t going to be a next version, and that is really bad for Microsoft reputation.&#xA;From my point of view, this is going to be an example that I will use whenever someone tries to sell me half baked solutions from Microsoft (just to note, I don&#x27;t consider Linq to SQL half baked) and tell me to wait for vNext with all the features in the world.&#xA;It doesn&#x27;t matter how I turn this decision, I can&#x27;t find any way in which it make sense from Microsoft perspective.</p>
