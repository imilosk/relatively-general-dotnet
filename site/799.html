            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The P&amp;P groups has a lot of stuff that they release to the world, often with a lot of fanfare and people talking about that. I have reached the point that I no longer care about what the P&amp;P guys are doing. Just having them release something, practically guaratees that this is not something that I would like to use.    This has nothing&#xA0;to do with OSS vs. MS or something stupid like that. This has to do with the following reasons:            The P&amp;P team doesn&#x27;t work with their tools on real applications. Basically, these tools are created in vacum, not by having to solve real world problems. And going to a customer and asking about problems and then trying to give something that may solve that is not what I mean. I mean about having to work with a system day in and day out, and having the biggest incentive to smooth all the wrinkles.            The stuff that they release almost always build on the naked CLR, it tries to build on top of that something to ease the pains of people who are working with that. The problem is that if you are doing that, you may be making great strides in making a developer life easier, but you are taking them in the completely wrong direction.            Marketing. This is related to the next point, a lot of people are pushing this stuff, almost blindly. And Microsoft can dedicate a lot of resources to spread this around (evangelists, posts, articles, etc).            Quality vs. brand name. This is a touchy subject, and I would really like to make it clear that I am not saying that the P&amp;P is producing bad code. What I do want to say is that the P&amp;P code does not goes through the same level of scrutiny that real products from Microsoft goes through. In other words, the CLR, for instance, has gone a thorough testing and design effort. The DAAB, on the other hand, has a much lower testing &amp; design effort in comparision. The problem is that people are seeing Microsoft DAAB, and they automatically assume that this has the same quality.        I can push a code base fairly hard, and the CLR is pretty good about what I can do with it. When I tried to do the same to the P&amp;P stuff, it literally fell apart.    When looking at the stuff that the P&amp;P produce, I see things that are extremely complex to their purpose, hard to use and maintain, and don&#x27;t really add any value to me from where I stand today. I am not speaking blindly here, it took me 40 minutes to repreduce the policy injection block.    Even if some of the stuff that they are producing has good stuff in it, it is usually in a form too abstract to be readily used. The CAB is a good example, I like some of the ideas there, but it comes with so much weight around it that it is not worth bothering. I can build on the same ideas in half a day and end up with a far more light wieght approach, easily testable and easier to explain to the next developer.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Consider this scenario, where you need to build a complex application, and political issues says that you have to start from scratch. This means no access to any extrenal libraries (OSS or MS-Provided) ones.    Can you build a complex application that way?    The answer for me would be probably no. I know how I structure my applications today, and I am building them to use best practices approaches for maintainability and testability. There are a lot of tool support out there that I use in order to build my applications, not being able to use that would significantly cripple my ability to build applications.    I couldn&#x27;t even write those frameworks from scratch, at least not in a reasonable time frame. A basic OR/M layer should take about a week to write, but it would be very basic, and wouldn&#x27;t support any of the more powerful features that actually makes OR/M attractive (lazy loading &amp; eager loading, for instance). A basic IoC takes two days to write, but it wouldn&#x27;t allow interception and it wouldn&#x27;t allow easy extensibility, and support for complex nested dependencies is going to be severly limited.    If you aren&#x27;t working at that level, you may be able to roll out simple tools, and be successful, but I wouldn&#x27;t be able to work within those limitation (I am often not able to work within the limitations of the current tools, at which point I extend them :-) ).    Anyway, just a point I wanted to make. Don&#x27;t bother starting with a blank slate anymore, it is not worth it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Not really liking the name of this post, but...     A lot of people are familiar with GoF book, and quite a few people actually take pride in being able to use design patterns. One of the more horrifying indicators for trouble you can get is someone having the GoF book on their table, opened:          Right now, I consider the GoF book an essential part of the tools that I have in my toolkit, but knowing the GoF patterns is no longer an good indicator for quality, it is usually a sign of &quot;I am following the herd, and design patterns are supposed to be cool...&quot;     Something that I look at far more favorablely is the Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture&#xA0;book:         This take the concept of design patterns and move them from the class level to the application level, and that is much more meaningful conversation when you are thinking about applications now.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So after the conference ended, about 25 of us (speakers and attendees) had headed for a dinner, and then we came back to the hotel and sat on the pub, then we migrated downward to get for music (Carl Franklin and Mathew can&#x27;t-recall-last-name were amazing, and Roy had amazing songs).    All of that took roughly 10 hours of just being with the guys, and it produced some really great quotes. You are probably not going to figure some of this out, but I am going to post it anyway.    Quotes:            MS-Jews 1.0 Beta            Scott Bellware - &quot;I am trying to work here!&quot;            Beer Driven Behavior            Rhino Bitch            Smrufitecture            Drunk Driven Design            What does a guy like you does in a blog like this?

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Last night at the OSS panel, it was asked what are the indicators for a healthy OSS project. In my opinion, it is the size of the community and the number of active committers.    A good example of a project that wasn&#x27;t healthy is NDoc, when the lead (single?) developer left, the project was mostly stranded, and the community basically died around it. A good example of a healthy OSS project is Castle, where we currently have ~20 active committers,&#xA0;and a very active community.    By the way, by this metric, Rhino Mocks is not a healthy project, which also came up yesterday, if I happen to meet a Bus somehow, I am not sure that the project will continue, even though there are a large number of people using it.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">So, today I did two presentations. The first one, about Rhino Mocks, happened in conjuction to Jean Paul Boodhoo, so it was fairly sparse. I feel good about that presentation, I literally had finished on the last minute, and I got to covered everything that I wanted to, as well as got some good interaction from the participants.    The second session was about MonoRail, and I had some technical issues there. The demo failed in the middle of the presentation, it should teach me about trying to deviate from the script in the middle of a demo. I also seemed to have some problems speaking in the middle of the presentation, sort of tripping on myself.    I am afraid that I got to hyper-speak mode again, because I finished about 15 minutes too early, but there were a lot of questions about it, including stuff that I didn&#x27;t talk about in the talk itself (didn&#x27;t think that I would have the time for that).    Met Marc Andr&#xE9;&#xA0;from Castle, but didn&#x27;t get much time to speak&#xA0;with him :-(    On the evening there was the Open Source Panel, which was fun, and now I probably need to put a post&#xA0;or two&#xA0;about that one. After that there was the OR/M smackdown with Ted Neward on Dot Net Rocks, great discussion. It should be available next week, so look forward to that.    Lot of interesting talks during the day, as well, really liked the Pair Programming birds of feathers with the Oksana and Wendy&#xA0;from Oxygen Media.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Jeremy Miller, me and Udi Dahan&#xA0;had a discussion about the echo chamber effect. Basically,&#xA0;we tend to talk to a lot of people who either agree with us, or in complete disagreement. Either way, the people we tend to talk to are those who are involved.    I was at a client two weeks ago (trying to tell them that a single remote debug server for 20 developers is not practical) and I saw people still doing active development in ASP classic. I went to lunch with them and tried some conversation avenues, but they were all met with glazed stares. This people are building something really big, which tens of thousands of people are using daily, and they literally had no idea about what Web Services were. (That was when I stopped to last year&#x27;s buzzwards, in order to find if they know that.)    That is somewhat depressing, because there is no way that anything that we do here would be able to reach those types of guys.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I had a few discussions recently with Roy Osherove, about learning WPF. Roy is a fun of Petzold book about it, mainly because it goes through all the API and explain their usage in depth. I haven&#x27;t read that book, but I am currently going through Adam Nathan&#x27;s book about WPF, and I am enjoying it very much.&#xA;    From Roy&#x27;s perspective, Adam&#x27;s book is too high level, not giving all the details that Roy feels he should know in order to be a great WPF developer. I don&#x27;t agree with that approach, personally. I like Adam&#x27;s book because it talks about the concepts, and it has just enough low level details so I can grasp the how without getting lost in the details.&#xA;    I am certain that there are certain depths and pitalls that Adam&#x27;s book doesn&#x27;t cover, and Petzlod&#x27;s book does, but I don&#x27;t learn that way. I want a book to learn the high level stuff, the model, and then I can start working with the technology. Frankly, I can figure out stuff much easier on Reflector than from a book, and that is the kind of learning that sticks.&#xA;    Then again, I am the guy that learned the Page LifeCycle model by going through System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain on reflector, cursing all the way.&#xA;    Roy&#x27;s approach is more structured, I think, but my way allows me to just grasp how things works, and then I can do the rest on the job. It works for building applications that uses this stuff, but probably not if you want to go deeper into this.</p>

            <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">Given a choice between a developer who can explain what MVC is vs. a developer that knows .Net 3.0, I would always choice the first developer. I just had finished talking about this with Jeremy Miller and Udi Dahan&#xA0;about the most important things that you need to have in your developers. The converstion started from talking about making design &quot;compromises&quot; for non-advance developers. And moved to the reasoning behind this approach.     Basically, there are a lot of developers that chase that technological rainbow, investing all their time in technology, and not on understanding. This&#xA0;is a great treatise about the subject:... Job requirements for engineers have an alphabet soup attached to them. I&#x27;ve been rejected for jobs because the version of Sybase I last used is too old, and this is for a role where SQL isn&#x27;t even the core requirement ...    Frankly, it is a much better investment to understand the design of software than the mechanics of it. It makes it much easier to pick up the mechanics at a later date.    Companies that don&#x27;t understand that is doing themselves a dis-service, because they are basically hiring a programmer whose only interest is to use current technologies, not the business problem or the best way to solve that. Technical solution isn&#x27;t the only way, or even the recommended one.</p>
