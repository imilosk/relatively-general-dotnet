We have a set of a few million records of transactions, each one of them looking like this:We want to check a new transaction against the history of data for this particular customer. The problem is that we have a very limited time frame to approve / reject a transaction. Trying to crawl through a lot of data about the customer may very well lead to the transaction timing out. So we prepare in advance. Here is the index I created, which summarize information about a particular customer:&#xA;    &#xA;      &#xA;        &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;        &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;      This file contains bidirectional Unicode text that may be interpreted or compiled differently than what appears below.

I&#x2019;m not sure what you&#x2019;ll need for approving a transaction, but I pulled up a few things. Here is the result of the index for a particular customer:What is most important, however, is the time it takes to get this result:The idea is that we are able to gather information that can quickly determine if the next transaction is valid. For example, we can check if the current merchant is in the list of good destinations. If so, that is a strong indication it is good. We can also check if the amount of the transaction matches previous amounts for the transaction, as well as many other checks. The key here is that we can get RavenDB to do all the work in the background and immediately produce the right result for us when needed.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">I got an interesting question while discussing timeseries, and I thought it would make for a good blog post. Consider the timeseries that we have on the right. It shows a particular sensor value over a period of time.The sensor in question reports data only when the value changes, but we want to get the data on every 30 minutes scale. How can we do that? It turns out that this is pretty easy to do by just asking RavenDB to do so.

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">There have been a couple of cases where I was working on a feature, usually a big and complex one, that made me realize that I&#x2019;m just not smart enough to actually build it.A long time ago (five or six years), I had to tackle free space handling inside of Voron. When an operation cause a page to be released, we need to register that page somewhere, so we&#x2019;ll be able to reuse it later on. This doesn&#x2019;t seem like too complex a feature, right? It is just a free list, what is the issue? The problem was that the free list itself was managed as pages, and changes to the free list might cause pages to be allocated or de-allocated. This can happen while the free list operation is running. Basically, I had to make the free list code re-entrant. That was something that I tried to do for a long while, before just giving up. I wasn&#x2019;t smart enough to handle that scenario properly. I could plug the leaks, but it was too complex and obvious that I&#x2019;m going to run into additional cases where this would cause issues.I had to use another strategy to handle this. Instead of allowing the free list to do dynamic allocations, I allocated the free list once, and then used a bitmap mode to store the data itself. That means that modifications to the free list couldn&#x2019;t cause us to mutate the structure of the free list itself. The crisis was averted and the feature was saved. I just checked, and the last meaningful change that happened for this piece of code was in Oct 2016, so it has been really stable for us.The other feature where I realized I&#x2019;m not smart enough to handle came up recently. I was working on the documents compression feature. One of the more important aspects of this feature is the ability to retrain, which means that when compressing a document, we&#x2019;ll use a dictionary to reduce the size, and if the dictionary isn&#x2019;t well suited, we&#x2019;ll create a new one. The first implementation used a dictionary per file range. So all the documents that are placed on a particular location will use the same dictionary. That has high correlation to the documents written at the same time and had the benefit of ensuring that new updates to the same document will use its original dictionary. That is likely to result in good compression rate over time. The problem was that during this process, we may find out that the dictionary isn&#x2019;t suited for our needs and that we need to retrain. At this point, however, we were already computed the required space. But&#x2026; the new dictionary may compress the data different (both higher and lower than what was expected). The fact that I could no longer rely on the size of the data during the save process lead to a lot of heartache. The issue was worse because we first try to compress the value using a specific dictionary, find that we can&#x2019;t place it in the right location and need to put it in another place.However, to find the new place, we need to be know what is the size that we need to allocate. And the new location may have a different dictionary, and there the compressed value is different&#x2026;Data may move inside RavenDB for a host of reasons, compaction, defrag, etc. Whenever we would move the data, we would need to recompress it, which led to a lot of complexity. I tried fighting that for a while, but it was obvious that I can&#x2019;t manage the complexity.I changed things around. Instead of having a dictionary per file range, I tagged the compressed value with a dictionary id. That way, each document could store the dictionary that it was using. That simplified the problem space greatly, because I only need to compress the data once, and afterward the size of the data remains the same. It meant that I had to keep a registry of the dictionaries, instead of placing a dictionary at the end of the specified file range, and it somewhat complicates recovery, but the overall system is ever so much simpler and it took a lot less effort and complexity to stabilize. I&#x2019;m not sure why just these problems shown themselves to be beyond my capabilities. But it does bring to mind a very important quote:When I Wrote It, Only God and I Knew the Meaning; Now God Alone KnowsI also have to admit that I have had no idea that this quote predates code and computing.

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">A user reported a bug to our support. When running on MacOS, they were unable to authenticate against a remote RavenDB instance. That was strange, since we support running on MacOS, both as a client and as a server. We have had some issues around different behavior, but it is working, so what could the issue be?RavenDB uses X509 certificates for authentication. That ensure mutual authentication for client and server, as well as secure the communication from any prying eyes. But on that particular system, it just did not work. RavenDB was accessible, but when attempting to access it, we weren&#x2019;t able to authenticate. When using the browser, we didn&#x2019;t get the &#x201C;Choose the certificate&#x201D; dialog either. That was really strange.&#xA0; Digging deeper, we verified that the certificate was setup property in the keychain. We also tested FireFox, which has a separate store for certificates, nothing worked. Then we tested using curl, and were able to properly access and authenticate to the server. So something was really strange here. Testing from a different machine, we were able to observe no issues. The user mentioned that they recently moved to Catalina, which is known to have some changes in how it process certificates. None of which applied to our scenario, however.Eventually, we started comparing network traces and then we found something really interesting. Take a look at this:That was an interesting discovery. The user had an anti virus installed, and the AV installed a root CA and then setup a proxy to direct all traffic through the AV. Because it added a root CA, it was able to sniff all the traffic on the machine.However, with a client certificate, that model doesn&#x2019;t work. The proxy would need to have the private key of the certificate to be able to authenticate to the remote system, which it obviously does not have. It silently stripped the request for a client certificate, which meant that as far as RavenDB was concerned, we saw no client certificate in the request, so we rightfully rejected it.I found it interesting that we were able to actually use curl, I assume that Avast didn&#x2019;t setup the proxy so curl would be included. The solution was simple, exclude RavenDB from the inspected addresses, which immediately fixed the problem.I spent some time trying to figure out if there was a good way for us to detect this automatically. Sadly, there is no way to tell from the client side what is the certificate that was used. If there was, we could compare it to the expected result and alert on that.</p>

This is a topic I spend a lot of time on, so I went over the post in detail. I don&#x2019;t like this approach, because it has several subtle issues that are going to bite you down the road. All of them are relatively obscure, and all of them are going to happen in production in short order.Go read the blog post, it explains the reasoning well.

On multiple nodes, you are running this method, and it will coordinate using Postgres to ensure that there is only a single process that owns the lock at any given point in time. At least, that is the idea. In practice, there are issues.Let&#x2019;s assume that we are protecting a shared resource, such as a printer. We want to serialize access to the printer so two print jobs won&#x2019;t get their pages mixed together. For simplicity, we&#x2019;ll assume just two such nodes that compete on the lock.On startup, one of the nodes will successfully get the lock, and the other will not, resulting in retries. So far, this is as expected. I&#x2019;m ignoring for now the lack of error handling, if we cannot start the connection, the whole thing is going to fail. This is sample code, so I&#x2019;m pointing this out because the code must be resilient to such issues. We may bring up a node before the database is ready, and in this case, you&#x2019;ll need to retry access the data. A much more serious problem here is that we have a way for the process to signal that it is broken, but there is no way for the service to tell the process that it is no longer the leader. Let&#x2019;s assume that a network issue has caused the connection to drop. The code, as written now, has no way of identifying this issue. It is actually worse than expected, because the connection isn&#x2019;t actually being used. So even if the connection has dropped, the service is not aware of this. Even this, though, is something that can be fixed in a straightforward manner. You can add a cancellation token that the process will listen to. You also need to keep verifying against the database server that you are still the owner of the lock and that the connection didn&#x2019;t drop / fail and released it behind your back. And of course, there may be a delay between losing the lock and finding out about that.That leads us to the most serious problem: Race conditions. In this case, even if the code handled all such scenarios nicely, we have to take into account the fact that we are dealing with separate resources here. In our example, we have Postgres for the leader election and the printer as the protected resource. The two nodes are competing on the lock, and then one of them starts printing. The lock is lost because of a network reset. At this point, Postgres frees the lock and the other node is able to lock it. It starts to run its own printing jobs. Let&#x2019;s say that the first node has a way to detect that it lost the lock. There is still the issue of how fast that can happen. It is very likely that at a certain point, you&#x2019;ll have two nodes that believe that they are the leader. That is a Bad Thing.A couple of years ago, GitHub was down for more than a day because of exactly this kind of a scenario. I analyzed the issue at the time in detail.In this case, using the system above, you are pretty much guaranteed to have a messed up printing job, with pages from multiple jobs mixed together. If you really care about consistency in the leader operations, you can&#x2019;t just run things using a leader election. You have to run everything through the same mechanism. In GitHub&#x2019;s example, they used Raft (a distributed consensus algorithm), but they used that to make decisions on a separate system, so there was a guarantee for inconsistency in that system. In other words, you are either all in to distributed consensus or you should be out. Note that being out is fine, if you don&#x2019;t care about short periods of multiple leaders. But if you need to ensure that this is the case, you cannot make it work without building it properly from the ground up.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">The RavenDB Time Series webinar is now available, and as usual, I would love your feedback. This webinar had the most questions yet, including a few curve balls that I had to field midway through. It was fun.I also gave some bad information during the webinar, and I want to apologize for that. I mentioned some benchmark results and it appear that I didn&#x2019;t wait for the complete work to be done.Using the time series benchmark set, RavenDB can get some really nice numbers. All the numbers were run on i3.xlarge machine:The first benchmark was for a single value, across 100 different time series. RavenDB is actually faster here than the other two contenders combined. This is the most common scenario that we envisioned, and it was heavily optimized.For the other scenarios (100 time series, with 10 measurements on each tick and 4,000 time series with 10 measurements with each tick) RavenDB does very nicely. It is significantly faster than InfluxDB, but not as fast as TimescaleDB in this scenario. That said, when it comes to queries, we have a whole different ballgame. Here we have the following scenarios:single-groupby-1-1-1Simple aggregate (MAX) on one metric for 1 host, every 5 mins for 1 hoursingle-groupby-1-1-12Simple aggregate (MAX) on one metric for 1 host, every 5 mins for 12 hourssingle-groupby-1-8-1Simple aggregate (MAX) on one metric for 8 hosts, every 5 mins for 1 hourHere we are running this on a small data set, with 100 time series with a single measurement. You see it properly, RavenDB is able to run this fast enough that we cannot measure the speed of the query.When we have 10 measurements per time series, we put a little more effort of RavenDB, but it is still either the fastest or very nearly so.When we increase the size of the data to 4,000 time series each with 10 measurements per tick, we see that RavenDB&#x2019;s performance is effectively constant. This is because RavenDB is being smart about how it runs queries and is able to do a lot of work upfront, significantly improving query time.And this is before we gotten to the fact that you can run your indexes on time series data as well. Take a look at the webinar recording, I think you&#x2019;ll be impressed.</p>

        <p class="max-w-full w-full line-clamp-5 text-justify mb-20">In RavenDB, I have just added support for document compression using zstd. That was a non trivial feature, if only because we need to also take into account document changes over time and other important aspects. You can read all about those in the post that describe the feature. This post isn&#x2019;t actually about this feature, it is about how zstd got the ability to train on external data. One of the things that I do on a project that I am interested in is read, not just the code, but also things like issue tracking, discussions etc that surround it. I find that it gives me a lot more context about the proper use of the code.During my tour of the zstd project, I run into this issue. This is the original issue that got zstd the ability to use an external dictionary to compress known data. I wrote a blog post on the topic, because the difference in efficiency is huge. A 52 MB of JSON docs compress to 1MB if you compress all the documents together. If you compress each document independently, you&#x2019;ll get 6.8 MB. With a dictionary, however, you can reduce that by 20% &#x2013; 30%, and with an adaptive dictionary, you can do even better.So I was interested in reading how this feature came about. And I was very surprised to find my own name there. To be rather more exact, in 2014, I wanted to understand compression better, so I wrote a small compression library. It isn&#x2019;t a very good one, and it is mostly based around femtozip anyway, but it was useful for me to understand what was going on there. It seems that this was also useful to Christophe, over a year later, to get interested enough to add this capacity to zstd. And the circle came around full circle this year, six years after my original research into compression, when RavenDB has a really nice documents compression feature that can be traced back to me being curious a long time ago.</p>
